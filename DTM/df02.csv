"SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are",Molly Jane Zuckerman,6/7/2018 16:05,21383,422,"Jay Clayton, the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is not a security since it acts as a replacement for sovereign currencies, CNBC reports today, June 6.Clayton, when speaking about the “incredible promise” of distributed ledger technologies driving efficiencies in markets, clarified during today’s CNBC interview his thoughts on cryptocurrencies that are “replacements for sovereign currencies:”“Replace the dollar, the yen, the euro with Bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security.”While Clayton did not comment on specific assets besides Bitcoin about their status as securities, he went on to explain that what he considers to be securities are tokens that act as digital assets:“Where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture […] and in return for me giving you my money, you say, ‘You know what, I’m going to give you a return.’ That is a security, and we regulate that. We regulate the offering of that security, and we regulate the trading of that security.”When asked to make clear his statement on whether Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are securities, Clayton told the interviewers, CNBC’s Bob Pisani, “Bob, I just did.”Clayton added that the SEC won’t support changing the definition of a security to support the ICO community, as they are not “going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security which has worked well for a long time.”The SEC chair had previously praised distributed ledger tech, blockchain as an example, during February’s SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) cryptocurrency hearing. At the time, Clayton had noted that every ICO that the SEC had seen so far would be considered a security.Altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have come up in the cryptocurrency security question, with Joseph Lubin of Ethereum emphatically denying that ETH was ever a security, and Ripple similarly rejecting a security classification.Ripple is now facing a class action lawsuit from a disgruntled investor claiming that the sale of XRP is the sale of an unregistered security, with a former SEC chair recently appointed to represent Ripple in court.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ethereum News    #SEC    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #CFTC    #Ripple  
Japan's Financial Watchdog Rejects Crypto Exchange License for First Time,Marie Huillet,6/7/2018 13:15,8146,158,"Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has barred a crypto exchange from receiving an operating license for the first time, Nikkei Asian Review reports Tuesday, June 5.The regulator has now chosen to permanently deny registration to Yokohama-based FSHO, whose services were already suspended twice by the FSA this spring, over concerns the exchange operator did not sufficiently verify the identity of customers in cases of suspect transactions.The FSA has now reportedly concluded that FSHO lacks “the necessary systems to operate its business.”FSHO is one of only two crypto exchanges in Japan to have received two consecutive punishment notices from the FSA, the other being Coincheck, whose unprecedented $532 mln hack in January remains the biggest confirmed crypto theft in the industry’s history.By barring an exchange whose practices it considers unacceptable, the financial watchdog appears to be making good on its intent to clean-up Japan’s crypto industry, in the wake of both Coincheck and the notorious collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox back in 2014.Since April 2017, Japan’s Payment Services Act has required all crypto exchanges to be registered under an FSA license, with the first licenses being approved in September. This May, the regulator yet further toughened its license stipulations, placing an emphasis on AML and KYC compliance, and banning the trading of anonymity-oriented altcoins, such as Dash (DASH) and Monero (XMR).Nonetheless, the country continues to show exceptional crypto adoption levels. The FSA’s data from 17 domestic crypto exchanges found that as of the end of March 2018, there were at least 3.5 mln crypto traders in the country. Figures from CryptoCompare indicate that the Japanese Yen accounts for a staggering 59% of global Bitcoin trades as of press time.This makes it an attractive market for foreign capital, with leading US crypto exchange Coinbase this week revealing its plans to expand its services to Japan “within the year.” This month, Japanese crypto exchange BitTrade was bought for $50 mln by a Singaporean entrepreneur, who became the first foreign investor to hold a 100 percent stake in an FSA-licensed trading platform.A leading Japanese fintech company has also recently announced it would be launching a crypto asset exchange within the year.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Cryptocurrencies    #KYC  
LexisNexis Partners With Australian Crypto Exchange Blockbid to Increase Security,Helen Partz,6/5/2018 13:45,18990,205,"Risk management giant LexisNexis has partnered with crypto exchange Blockbid to increase the exchanges security measures Blockbid reports on its Medium account June 4. Blockbid is reportedly one of the first trading platforms to voluntarily observe global anti-money laundering (AML) measures by partnering with LexisNexis and ThreatMetrix security technology firms.Boosting fraud prevention and know your customer (KYC) measures in respect to banks, the solution “Trade with Confidence” intends to prevent crypto being used in cases of money laundering, terrorism financing, human trafficking, and other illegal activity.According to the blog post, the newly adopted technology by Melbourne-based exchange Blockbid combines physical and digital identity data, government-issued identifiers, addresses, and biometrics with device identification, geolocation, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence.Thomas C. Brown, senior vice president of US commercial markets and global market development at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, claimed that the “Trade with Confidence” system would increase public confidence by deploying the same regulatory tools as those used by major banks.“Implementing similar controls that the biggest banks in the world use adds credibility to cryptocurrency exchanges from a regulator point of view and instils consumer confidence. Ultimately these safeguards provide a solid foundation on which Blockbid and other companies can grow, profitably.”US-based LexisNexis Risk Solutions was founded in the 1970s as a subsidiary of global information and analytics company RELX Group (LSE: REL/NYSE: RELX), the firm currently has about 10,000 employees according to its LinkedIn profile.Regulatory agencies and governments have expressed trepidation about crypto due to its alleged uses for terrorism financing, money laundering, and other illicit activities. Earlier this year, a US congressman called crypto a “crock,” stating that its only possible use could be for illegal activities. Last week, the Dutch government released a report in which they found that, while crypto posed a low risk to the country’s financial system, they still noted its possible use for funding illicit behavior.Conversely, the Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury (FSTB) released a report on May 1, stating that cryptocurrencies do not create any visible impact in money laundering and terrorism financing. Earlier today, a former US federal prosecutor noted in an interview that more criminal activity is sponsored with fiat currency than with crypto.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Security    #AML    #Fraud    #KYC    #Money Laundering    #Government    #USA    #Markets    #Banks    #Australia    #Terrorism    #Tradings  
Russian Court Annuls Previous Decision to Block Bitcoin-Related Site,Helen Partz,6/5/2018 12:15,10605,211,"The City Court of St. Petersburg, Russia has overturned the District Court’s previous decision to block crypto media website Bitcoininfo.ru, local news outlet TASS reports June 4. The District Court’s judgement was handed down in July 2016 in compliance with a ban on  crypto-related information sources, as digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) were not legal in country.As TASS reports, the new decision was enacted after the Supreme Court of Russia referred the case for consideration to the St. Petersburg City Court, following a complaint action from the owner of Bitcoininfo.“The St. Petersburg City Court overturned the District Court’s decision that recognized the information placed on the website Bitcoininfo.ru as prohibited for viewing.”The press service of the Court also reported that in July 2016 the St. Petersburg Vyborg District Court banned the website per the application of local prosecutors. The case was considered by the court without the website owners present.According to Bitcoininfo’s representative, the application process was unilaterally initiated by prosecutors without involving the website owners and without requesting the removal of content that was considered illegal. He also noted that the City Court refused to accept a request for appeal after the ban was enacted.Per the case file, local prosecutors requested a ban on the website because it contained information about cryptocurrencies, which are “outside of government control,” “facilitate growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have specific consumer properties.”Earlier this year the City Court of St. Petersburg, annulled a trial court’s previous decision to ban 40 Bitcoin-related websites in the Russian Federation. The ban was initiated because the sites were “spreading information” about digital currency that “is not backed by any real asset and does not provide information about its owners.”The court’s decision precedes an upcoming crypto regulatory framework that is scheduled for July 1 by decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The framework is supported by the Russian State Duma’s Committee for Legislative Work and includes a bill “On Digital Financial Assets” which was released in March of this year.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government  
Former SEC Chair Represents Ripple in Lawsuit for Alleged Sale of Unregistered Securities,Ana Alexandre,6/5/2018 12:56,14094,172,"Fintech company Ripple Labs has employed Debevoise & Plimpton’s Mary Jo White and  Andrew Ceresney to represent them in a class action lawsuit for the alleged sale of unregistered securities, Law.com reported June 4. Mary Jo White previously held the position of chair at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The court paper for Ripple (XRP) reveals that the attorneys will represent the company in a lawsuit filed by investor Ryan Coffey last month. Coffey claims that he lost $551.89 trading Ripple’s XRP tokens, alleging that the digital currency should have been registered as a security with the SEC. He alleges that Ripple profited from increases in the cryptocurrency’s price at the expense of investors as Ripple maintains a “centralized XRP” ledger.The plaintiff is looking to rescind over $300 mln in XRP purchases and set up a trust over the proceeds of Ripple’s alleged sales of digital currency.The filings also state that the case has been moved from California state court to a federal court in the Northern District of California. Ripple’s lawyers say that the suit should be handled in federal court rather than in the San Francisco Superior Court, where the complaint was initially filed.Ripple’s spokeswoman said that at the moment the lawsuit was filed, the SEC had not yet decided whether XRP is a security. “We continue to believe XRP should not be classified as a security,” she claimed in response to the complaint, adding:“We feel confident that the claims regarding XRP are completely unfounded both in law and fact.”Taylor-Copeland, the plaintiff’s lawyer said that moving the case to federal court was “entirely improper” and that he intends to return it to the state judiciary system. He commented on the case:“Whether or not their XRP token is a security is an existential threat to their entire business model.”In April, former Goldman Sachs partner and government regulator Gary Gensler said that Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple should likely be considered unregistered securities. Gensler noted that he does not classify Bitcoin as a security because it was not issued through an Initial Coin Offering and has a decentralized network of developers. In regards to ETH and XRP, he said that “there is a strong case for both of them — but particularly Ripple — that they are noncompliant securities.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Altcoin News    #Ripple    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies    #Crimes    #Government  
SEC Names New Senior Advisor to Oversee Crypto Regulation,Marie Huillet,6/5/2018 20:05,9216,192,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created a new senior advisory position to oversee securities regulation of the crypto sphere, according to a press release published today, June 4.Ms. Valerie A. Szczepanik has been named Senior Advisor for Digital Assets, as well as Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance. She will be tasked with “coordinat[ing] efforts across all SEC Divisions and Offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies.”  Formerly the head of the SEC’s distributed ledger group, Szczepanik recently participated in the Consensus blockchain conference in New York, and was quoted as saying that “if you want [the crypto] industry to flourish, protection of investors should be at the forefront.”In her official statement today, Szczepanik struck a similar note, saying she would use the new role “to facilitate capital formation, promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and protect investors, particularly Main Street investors.”In his response to today’s appointment, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that Szczepanik was “the right person to coordinate our efforts in this dynamic area that has both promise and risk.”  The SEC considers cryptocurrencies to be securities, which brings them under the purview of its jurisdiction. According to the 70 year old Howey Test, a security involves the investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts.During February’s US SEC and CFTC senate hearing, Chairman Clayton stressed that while every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is considered a security, a distinction should be made between tokens and major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The latter has reportedly been a subject of debate among US regulators, some of whom contend that Ethereum is a security. Were such a determination to be made, its 2014 ICO would constitute an unregistered security offering.The SEC continues to raise concerns about ICOs, conducting a sweeping probe in February 2018, in which it issued subpoenas to force the closure of a number of “unregistered securities” in the ICO space. Most recently, the organization has concentrated its efforts on educating investors about potential risks, creating a website for a fake ICO that was designed to imitate the classic “red flags” of fraudulent token sales.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA  
Former US Federal Prosecutor at Money20/20: ‘A Lot More’ Crimes Committed With Fiat Than Crypto,Marie Huillet,6/5/2018 6:19,7957,321,"Former U.S. Federal Prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan spoke at a panel during the Money20/20 Europe conference in Amsterdam Monday, June 4, suggesting that we need to “get rid of the negative connotations” surrounding the emerging crypto industry.Buchanan emphasized that “a lot more” crimes have in fact been committed with fiat currencies, and expanded upon her point in a subsequent interview with Cointelegraph:“I served 21 years at the [US] Justice Department and it’s not fair to say there is a greater amount of crime with cryptocurrencies. In fact I would strongly disagree with that… [what’s more], cryptocurrencies can be traced, unlike fiat currencies [cash].”As CT’s correspondent noted, the notion that transactions involving crypto are in fact more traceable than fiat currencies can seem counterintuitive, given that achieving anonymity was one of the motivating impulses behind the invention of cryptocurrencies.Buchanan, however, stressed that there are now many “commercially available” tools that law enforcement can leverage to trace how currency has moved on a blockchain. She mentioned blockchain-specific intelligence systems such as Elliptic and Chainalysis as prominent examples.Nonetheless, Buchanan admitted that law enforcement “has a lot of catching up to do,” likening the challenge to the early days of the internet. She suggested that regulators, too, will need to “update” their practices in order to “keep pace,” as the outdated legislation introduced in the early 20th century for traditional securities is proving itself an awkward fit for 21st century innovations.Buchanan is currently serving as a General Counsel to major crypto exchange Kraken, and says she has been “very involved” in the crypto industry for the past four to five years. She advocated cryptocurrencies as a “wonderful tool” that provides a “cost-effective” means for the transfer of value globally. When asked about the future of crypto adoption, Buchanan considered that we’re “already” seeing it “around the world,” suggesting its increasing use by unbanked populations.  As a recent Cointelegraph report showed, cryptocurrencies are indisputably exploited for illicit ends, with an early 2018 paper estimating that “approximately one-quarter of all users... and close to one-half of Bitcoin transactions...are associated with illegal activity.”However, these findings, when placed within a broader context, fall into a more nuanced light. Whereas global illicit Bitcoin activity annually is estimated at a value of around $72 bln, the same paper cites figures for 2010 that reveal that $100 bln in fiat was spent on drugs in the US alone.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Crimes    #Adoption  
"Spain Introduces Innovation-Aimed Crypto Regulation, But Political Unrest Might Cause a Setback",Stephen O'Neal,6/5/2018 5:45,13978,285,"On May 30, the Spanish Congress unanimously supported draft legislation that would favorably regulate blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in the country. While the move marks pro-crypto tendencies among local politicians, there are complications that the reform might stumble upon, namely EU compliance laws and the very recent overthrow of prime minister Mariano Rajoy.Currently, there is no regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in Spain. Bitcoin is thus not considered legal currency in the country. According to the Library of Congress, however, it may be viewed as a “digital good” and can therefore comply with the rules of barter in Spain’s civil code.Due to the absence of a supervisory framework, the draft calls for a review of regulations pertaining to Bitcoin and altcoins, as well as to blockchain, proposing to introduce the technology to the Spanish market through “controlled testing environments,” commonly referred to as “regulatory sandboxes.”The sandboxes will allegedly help to foster fintech startups, which was one of the main areas discussed by Congress last Wednesday. “A company cannot wait years for the law to regulate its new activity, but at the same time it has to be sure that it will not be sanctioned for innovating even if its developments are unknown at the moment”, explains Marta Plana, the president of Foro Fintech, a local organisation that defends the needs of innovative companies in the financial sector.Spain seems to be drawing its inspiration from the UK’s success with fintech-oriented testing grounds. In March, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the launch of a global fintech regulatory sandbox, after the successful 2016 release of a UK sandbox. Over three years, the UK has approved around 80 new licenses, while more than 250 companies have tested their businesses in the fintech-boosting zone. Recently, Belarus has shown similar tendencies by creating the so-called High-Tech Park (HTP), which offers a number of benefits to attract fintech professionals from around the world.Rodrigo García de la Cruz, president of the Spanish Fintech and Insurtech Association, confirmed that they were inspired by international practices in a comment for La Vanguardia:""It is an experience that is giving very positive results and that has led many countries to study its implementation. If we hurry up here in Spain, we could become a pole of attraction for financial innovation.""As a result of the hearing, Congress has also agreed to promote blockchain as a cost-efficient and disintermediated system for payments and transfers, which is no surprise given recent pro-blockchain leanings in the country. A week ago, Barcelona revealed it would launch a specialized blockchain space in the city’s tech hub to foster growth and innovation in the local digital ecosystem, while in April, Spanish Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) became the first global bank to issue a loan using blockchain. Moreover, in March, even the governor of the Bank of Spain came out in favor of the possibilities of blockchain, albeit noting that “the technology is not yet mature”.Further, the draft legislation raises the need for ‘proportionate mechanisms’ to ensure that all parties involved in crypto will comply with information disclosure obligations to the Spanish Treasury and duly file their tax returns. It also highlights potential pitfalls associated with “high-risk” financial assets, arguing that “adequate dissemination of information” is important to protect investors from bad actors.To this end, the draft thus proposes that the government cooperate with the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain to coordinate a common regulatory position regarding crypto in the broader European context.However, while uniting around blockchain as well, the EU regulatory mood towards cryptocurrencies has so far been more guarded. On May 14, the European Union approved new anti-money laundering (AML) legislation in part targeting anonymity in cryptocurrency market.Once it comes into effect, players such as crypto exchanges will have to comply with AML guidelines, which will likely include full customer verification, according to the content of the package passed in April. The new rules will reportedly be published in the Official Journal of the EU and the member states will have 18 months to transfer them into their national legislation. It is worth noting that European authorities are specifically targeting anonymity in the use of cryptocurrencies.News about innovation-aimed crypto regulations in Spain have been outshadowed by the ousting of the current PM Mariano Rajoy. On June 1, Rajoy was set to be voted out of office and replaced by Socialist chief Pedro Sanchez, in a no-confidence motion triggered by an extensive corruption case involving members of his party, the center-right People’s Party.As CNBC points out, Rajoy's departure could trigger another political crisis in southern Europe, “further unnerving financial markets already wrongfooted by failed attempts to form a government in Italy three months after a national election”.Moreover, La Vanguardia mentions that the no-confidence vote initiated by Pedro Sanchez can delay the pro-crypto reform. According to the local media, the draft was open to public consultation until June 7, while the final text would be reviewed around July 7. However, now that Rajoy has been voted out, there might be a call for new elections if Sanchez fails to form a government.A call for elections, in turn, can potentially delay the project “for more than half a year”, causing interested European countries to move for other options, such as the UK version. La Vanguardia argues that the “sandbox” project “has already suffered a major hit” with the departure of one of its main innovators Luis de Guindos, who left on March 8.Meanwhile, Malta may intercept Spain’s ambitions, as on March 28, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) published a consultation document which “provided guidance on the use of Distributed Ledger Technology and on the acceptance of Virtual Currencies through the implementation of a Sandbox Environment”. Although the proposal refers to the gaming industry, if proven effective, the initiative can spread further to the fintech area, as Jaime Bofill, partner at Hogan Lovells, a firm that advises Fintech companies around the world, explained:""[Reportedly, in Malta] the approval of laws is not delayed as much as in Spain. [Therefore], they could take advantage and get the businesses that are pending to come to Spain"".",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Spain    #Fintech    #Sandbox  
New York State Legislature Proposes Creation of Cryptocurrency Task Force,Ana Alexandre,6/4/2018 13:20,22454,263,"The banks committee of the New York state legislature voted on Wednesday, May 30 to progress a bill that would create a digital currency task force. The task force would study the potential effects of the implementation of cryptocurrencies on financial markets in the state of New York.If passed, the bill would establish a group consisting of nine members which would be called on to submit a report to the governor, temporary president of the senate, and the speaker of the  assembly by December of 2019. While preparing the report, the task force may reportedly consult with any organization, government entity or person.According to the legislation, the report would study the impact of regulations on the development of digital currencies and blockchain industries within the state, the use of cryptocurrencies’ effect on local tax receipts, and the transparency of  the digital currency marketplace.Additionally, the task force would be required to provide the number of digital currencies and exchanges operating in New York state, information about large investors in the field, and the energy consumption necessary for coin mining operations.The task force would also provide “a review of laws and regulations on digital currency used by  other states, the federal government, foreign countries, and foreign political and economic unions to regulate the marketplace.”Last week, US and Canadian state and provincial securities regulators opened probes into potentially fraudulent crypto investment programs. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) said the probe is focusing on suspicious initial coin offerings (ICOs). Regulators from across 40 jurisdictions have initiated up to 70 investigations, with more reportedly to come in the following weeks. Earlier this year, NASAA released a warning to investors about the risks associated with crypto and initial ICOs.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #USA    #New York  
Japan: Financial Watchdog Probes Crypto Exchanges Over AML Compliance,Marie Huillet,6/2/2018 8:27,17063,165,"Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has issued business improvement orders to multiple domestic crypto exchanges, Cointelegraph Japan reports today, June 1st.One of FSA’ main concerns is the exchanges’ compliance with anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements. The agency’s inspections revealed that several of the crypto exchanges under its aegis are failing to apply sufficient Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks to confirm the identity of their users and prevent ‘bad actors’ from trading.The regulator has also raised concerns about cases where it claims that customers’ assets are not being adequately separated from those of the exchange.The regulator’s new orders have been issued to twelve crypto exchanges in total, two of which are officially licensed exchanges and ten of which are ‘quasi-operators,’ meaning that their application for an FSA operating license is still pending.According to Cointelegraph Japan, the FSA is expected to publish a report summarizing the results of its inspections later this month, and will also provide further guidance on required customer protection measures.Two high-profile scandals involving Japanese crypto exchanges - January’s unprecedented $532 mln Coincheck hack and the infamous collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox - have led to intensified interventions from the country’s financial watchdog.Since April 2017, Japan’s Payment Services Act has required all crypto exchanges to be registered under an FSA license, with the first licenses being approved in September. The regulator further tightened stipulations this year, placing an emphasis on AML and KYC compliance.A self-regulatory body for Japanese exchanges was convened in April to provide assistance to domestic operators, some of whom have opted to voluntarily close rather than stave mounting pressure from the FSA. Nonetheless, the country continues to show booming crypto adoption levels.Last month, a leading Japanese fintech company announced it would be launching a crypto asset exchange within the year.",11,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Crypto Exchange    #AML    #KYC  
"IMF Official Calls for Regulation, Tech Adoption by Banks to Fight ‘Crypto Competition’",Ana Alexandre,6/4/2018 11:23,26887,451,"An official from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggested that central banks need to make fiat currencies “more attractive for the digital age” in an article published May 31. Deputy Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department Dong He suggested three responses to combat potential competition to central banks from cryptocurrencies.First, He stated that, “[Central banks] should continue to strive to make fiat currencies better and more stable units of account.” He stressed the role collective expertise and experience play in monetary policymaking. The article quotes IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, who said that “the best response by central banks [to crypto] is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.”The deputy director then argued that it is necessary to regulate the use of crypto assets to hold off regulatory arbitrage and any “unfair competitive advantage” crypto assets can get from lighter regulation. He explained:“That means rigorously applying measures to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, strengthening consumer protection, and effectively taxing crypto transactions.”He also suggested issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to “make their money more attractive for use as a settlement vehicle.” He said that a CBDC could reduce transaction costs for individuals and small businesses, as well as allow long-distance transactions:“For example, they could make central bank money user-friendly in the digital world by issuing digital tokens of their own to supplement physical cash and bank reserves. Such central bank digital currency could be exchanged, peer to peer in a decentralized manner, much as crypto assets are.”He suggested that central banks can profit from the underlying technology of crypto assets, saying that monetary policymaking can benefit from technology by improving central banks’ forecasts using big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.IMF officials have sharply criticized cryptocurrencies in the past, and suggested they be more thoroughly regulated. Earlier this year, Christine Lagarde stated that regulation of cryptocurrencies is “inevitable” and necessary on an international level, focusing on regulating “activities” over “entities.”In March, Lagarde said that crypto markets must be regulated by the same laws that apply to traditional markets. She argued that cryptocurrencies could threaten the stability of traditional financial markets, and that regulations must be developed on a global scale with help from the IMF.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Banks  
BitLicense Approval Shines Fresh Light On New York-Crypto Relationship,Chrisjan Pauw,6/3/2018 6:15,19234,214,"The recent approval of Genesis Global Trading’s BitLicense application has shone fresh light on New York State’s relationship with the cryptocurrency industry.Although New York is historically a business-friendly center and international financial hub, many industry players have criticized the regulatory requirements enforced by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) through the BitLicense since its release date in 2015.Most of these criticisms were confirmed in a round table held earlier this year by New York State senators Jesse Hamilton and David Carlucci, who invited cryptocurrency companies to raise their concerns about the BitLicense.Stakeholders reiterated that the regulatory requirements set by the DFS are too burdensome for small companies to bear, that it’s a one-size-fits-all regulation and ultimately that it stifles innovationEven before the initial release of BitLicense back in 2015, the Editor of MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative, Brian Forde, alluded to the fact that this is what will happen, with only the largest companies possessing ample resources able to comply with the strict regulations.“If changes to the proposed BitLicense are not made, only a handful of the most well-funded companies will survive?—?not because they are providing the best product or service, but because they have access to the most money.”The BitLicense is issued by the DFS to those able to meet regulatory requirements and engaging in one of the following activities:The DFS has also indicated that cryptocurrency mining will not form part of the regulation.Some of the regulatory requirements include:The BitLicense became effective in New York on June 24, 2015 but in the three years since then, only five crypto-related companies have been approved for a BitLicense in the state.This is perhaps a testament to strict regulatory burden it imposes on companies, but also to the demanding 31-page application form that has to be completed as a very first step.Out of the very few companies who have been granted a BitLicense, is XRP II LLC, an affiliate of Ripple, with none other than Ben Lawsky, former DFS Superintendent and chief architect of the BitLicense, on the board of directors.Not everyone thinks the BitLicense is bad for business though. The current DFS Superintendent, Maria Vullo has stated in her Spring Meeting Remarks that ""The regulatory structure that we created for virtual currency has helped our licensed companies attract greater interest from customers, investors, and potential financial services partners seeking to pursue further innovation, while protecting market integrity by stringent standards applicable to all law-abiding business enterprises.""Since its release, the strenuous requirements of the BitLicense have forced many crypto startups to leave New York, in a movement that’s been dubbed the Bit-exodus.Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of Kraken, a Bitcoin exchange, explained why his company decided to leave New York.""There were some things about it that were just untenable … having to disclose all the information about your global client base to the state of New York – we just couldn't live with.”CEO and Founder of ShapeShift, another cryptocurrency exchange that left New York, also cited restrictive innovation as their reason for leaving the area.""I went from loving the city and seeing it as a symbol of progress … to seeing it as an enemy of innovation. The regulators here want to treat every financial entity like a bank … we aren't banks, we don't want to be banks … everything we build is to do something in opposition to what banks have done,""Other crypto companies that followed suit in the wake of the BitLicense storm include LocalBitCoins, Rebit, Genesis Mining, BitFinex, to name a few, with others, like Eobot, having to shut down operations entirely.The Consensus 2018 panel agreed that New York is the financial capital of the world but the blockchain community is international, and ultimately that the enforcement of the BitLicense is more harmful to the state than it is for the international cryptocurrency community.The BitLicense is in stark contrast to New York’s welcoming attitude towards cryptocurrency opportunities and blockchain as a whole in the state.Earlier in May, the President and CEO of the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), stated that there’s no city in the world that’s better positioned to lead the way in blockchain innovation, as he announced a number of blockchain-related initiatives for the city, including an NYC blockchain Resource Center and a public competition for blockchain-based apps.New York has also embraced cryptocurrency innovation in the past by being one of the first cities where property could be bought using Bitcoin, to install Bitcoin ATM’s and where diamond retailers accepted payment in Bitcoin. Support for crypto even showed up in the NY fashion week and at one point New York was named as the second most Bitcoin-friendly city in America.In the absence of any real federal regulation dictating cryptocurrency-based operations in the US, state regulators have a real opportunity to entice these organizations to move their business into their jurisdiction.Even the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn’t introduced any specific crypto related governance, other than whether or not tokens launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) should be considered as a utility or a security, and as such, might be subject to regulation.An unlikely state like Wyoming has taken advantage of this and shown that even though regulations are necessary to protect consumers, it can be done in such a way to promote cryptocurrency and blockchain operations, rather than chasing innovation away. In the space of several weeks, the state passed five separate bills for the advancement of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.Given New York’s reputation as a global financial hub that has attracted businesses from all over the world and supported innovation across many industries - including in the blockchain and crypto space - it is curious, to say the least, why regulators have chosen to go fundamentally against the grain with overbearing regulations. Especially if we consider that, at the moment, any cryptocurrency regulation in the US is more state driven rather than federal.Although Genesis’s BitLicense application approval is a step in the right direction, the consensus is that the BitLicence process has all but destroyed the New York-crypto relationship and has been bad for innovation and business as a whole.There might, however, be relief on the horizon for cryptocurrency startups in New York, including for those looking to move back into the state lines. Earlier this year, New York State Assembly legislator, Ron Kim, proposed a bill to effectively replace the BitLicense process, relaxing regulatory requirements and entice crypto investors back into the Empire State.The current bill status is “In Committee” and still a few steps away from being passed but, if enough support is garnered, could signal the end for the BitLicense and perhaps a fresh start for cryptocurrency investors and businesses in New York.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Tradings    #BitLicense    #USA    #New York    #NYDFS    #XRP    #Bitcoin ATMs  
Coinbase Board Member: Crypto Ecosystem Will Not See Regulation for Years,Helen Partz,6/1/2018 12:40,18944,223,"Kathryn Haun, board member of Coinbase and HackerOne claimed that cryptocurrency and blockchain will not see regulation for years, Techcrunch reports May 31. Haun made her statements on regulation at the Code Conference in California today.Haun drew parallels between the internet and crypto, claiming that the in the early days of the internet, users called for one single regulatory body, which never took place. As per Haun, crypto and blockchain are following the same scheme of the development. She further pointed out that if regulation would have been developed a year ago, it would already be outdated due to the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs).Haun, who is also a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, argued that there cannot be any regulation in the crypto field until regulators gain a solid understanding of how it works. Haun stressed the need to “wait and see how the the technology develops,” adding that regulation should not “outpace understanding.”Today’s statements echoed those of Mike Lempres, Chief Legal and Risk Officer at Coinbase, who said during a Congressional hearing in March that the US regulatory system is currently “harming healthy innovation.” Lampres said there is a lack of understanding of what is allowed and how digital assets are considered under the law; either as securities, commodities, property, or money.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #Internet    #USA  
Spain: Innovation-Aimed Crypto Regulation Wins Cross-Party Support in Congress,Marie Huillet,6/1/2018 13:40,10177,230,"Draft legislation that would favorably regulate blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has received unanimous support in the Spanish Congress, Europa Press reported yesterday, May 30.The draft initiative, agreed upon with the majority parliamentary party Partido Popular (People’s Party), won the support of all parties present at the House Finance and Public Function Committee meeting on Wednesday.  The document calls for a review of regulations pertaining to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), as well as to blockchain, proposing to introduce the technology to the Spanish market through “controlled testing environments,” commonly referred to as ‘regulatory sandboxes.’The Congress has agreed to promote blockchain as a cost-efficient and disintermediated system for payments and transfers, advocating the need to foster fintech startups in particular.The draft further raises the need for ‘proportionate mechanisms’ to ensure that all entities implementing the new technology will comply with information disclosure obligations to the Spanish Treasury and duly file their tax returns. It also highlights potential pitfalls associated with “high-risk” financial assets, claiming that “adequate dissemination of information” is crucial to protect investors.To this end, the draft proposes that the government cooperate with the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the Bank of Spain to coordinate a common regulatory position regarding crypto in the broader European context.A week ago, Barcelona revealed it would launch a specialized blockchain space in the city’s tech hub to foster growth and innovation in the local digital ecosystem. In February, the European Commission announced the launch of a major Blockchain Observatory and Forum aiming to “unite” the EU economy around the new technology.While rallying around blockchain, the EU regulatory mood towards cryptocurrencies has so far been more cautious, with the recent ratification of anti-money-laundering (AML) legislative measures that address the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Major Europe-based crypto exchanges have recently called on EU regulators to provide more clarity and transparency for the crypto markets.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Spain    #EU    #Cryptocurrencies  
Bitcoin For America: Cryptocurrencies In Campaign Finance,Kirill Bryanov,6/10/2018 14:15,11030,301,"Last week, Secretary of State of Colorado Wayne Williams proposed a new set of rules for financing political campaigns, which now includes a section on cryptocurrencies. The original edition of the draft introduces the same caps for crypto donations as for fiat ones, while limiting anonymous contributions to $20. The move renders the overall picture of individual states’ handling political crypto contributions spottier than ever, as the last few months saw states adopting divergent approaches to the issue.Although a 2014 advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) remains a major reference point for anyone who seeks to boost their chances for election with digital money, this non-regulatory document is barely fit to serve as a definitive guide into the world of crypto campaign finance.The FEC came up with a set of guidelines in May 2014, responding to an inquiry from a Super PAC named Make Your Laws. This entity, which advocates for replacing representative democracy with a more inclusive form of ‘liquid democracy,’ requested clarification on whether it could accept BTC donations to fund political action. At that time, Bitcoin was worth some $400, and altcoins were not even considered as a vehicle for campaign finance. The FEC ruled that Bitcoin could be received by campaigns as ‘in-kind donations’ – a form of contribution that provides goods and services needed for organizations’ operations rather than the money to purchase those goods and services.Effectively, this means that campaigns cannot spend received Bitcoin directly, but rather have to ‘liquidate’ it and then deposit the money to their accounts. As far as donation caps are concerned, the commission was split across party lines, with Democrats advocating for a $100 limit, and Republicans standing for the standard federal $2,700 cap. Since the advisory opinion outlines recommendations rather than rules, GOP support for a larger cap had later inspired some politicians to allow themselves to go with the $2,700 limit.Given somewhat inconclusive federal guidelines, many state authorities have been facing similar inquiries ever since the FEC ruling was issued. Building up to the 2018 wave of primaries and elections, these requests have intensified. Oftentimes it is state governments’ ethics bodies that are tasked with deciding whether crypto donations are appropriate and how they should be governed. So far this year, several state commissions have either ruled against cryptocurrency donations or wavered on the issue, so the Colorado initiative, if successful, might become a precedent for other undecided states to consider.In October 2017, a Kansas candidate for office sought guidance on potential use of crypto contributions from the state’s Governmental Ethics Commission. Shortly after, the office had announced that Bitcoin is ‘too secretive and untraceable,’ and could be used by ‘totally unidentifiable lobbyists’ to influence local elections.Wisconsin Libertarian Party asked the State Ethics Commission in April to clarify whether it deems the use of cryptocurrency political contributions acceptable. The commission held public hearings and concluded that the issue should be decided by the state legislature. The time frame for the state House to rule on the issue is yet to be announced.Emmanuel Wilder, a Republican candidate for North Carolina State House, has approached State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement with a similar request in April. In his letter, Wilder acknowledged that traceability concerns exist, but still advocated for giving voters a choice between fiat and crypto donation formats, as well as supporting the ‘new upcoming financial service.’ The request is still under review.In South Carolina, the issue has been decided in a speedier manner, and not in favor of crypto enthusiasts. Britton Wolf, a 23-year-old Republican candidate for District 71 of the South Carolina House of Representatives in June primaries, asked the state House’s ethics committee whether he could use digital currency donations to support his campaign. The officials responded that he could not, since the definition of a campaign contribution, as provided by the state law, does not include cryptocurrency.Institutional politics is a field permeated by inertia and adherence to the status quo, so there is little wonder that cryptocurrency as a vehicle of political finance is still far from mainstream adoption. Politicians who use it are still vastly outnumbered, and for the majority of those who do, crypto donations constitute a minor share of overall funds.However, certain brands of politicians, such as firebrand libertarians and technology advocates, are already naturally predisposed to be relying on digital currency donations – accepting digital currency contributions has become an integral part of manifesting their ideology. Increasing mass adoption and surging prices are also factors that nudge more establishment actors to be looking towards crypto. Here are some of the most high-profile U.S. politicians on both federal and state levels who are vocal about their embrace of crypto funding.A Republican candidate for New Hampshire governor in 2014, Hemingway has been the first ever contender to the office to use cryptocurrency contributions in his campaign. Bitcoin donations amounted to about 20 percent of his overall funds. Hemingway never advanced to the general election, having lost to Walter Havenstein in the Republican primary.U.S. Representative Jared Polis, who is arguably the most outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology on the Capitol Hill, claims the credit of being the first acting Congressman to accept Bitcoin from his supporters. During his successful 2014 re-election campaign, he collected a modest $2,000 worth of crypto donations. In his 2018 bid for Colorado governor, Polis will surely exceed this figure by a significant margin.The libertarian’s 2016 bid for Missouri House of Representatives has the distinction of being the first campaign ever to be funded entirely in Bitcoin. The result of the experiment turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with Elder carrying just over 10 percent of the vote. In 2018, Elder is running for District 79 of the Missouri House of Representatives again.A feature of every list of Bitcoin-friendly politicians, Paul became the first presidential candidate to embrace cryptocurrency donations when he announced his bid for the 2016 election. Back in 2015, this caused quite a stir.In an apparent move to attract younger and tech-savvy voters, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced in April 2014 that he will accept Bitcoin contributions for his gubernatorial campaign. The strategy seems to have worked, as in January 2015 Abbott was sworn in as Governor of the state.A Republican seeking election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri this year, Petersen’s embrace of cryptocurrency is grounded in his pro-market ideology. His campaign manager called the use of bitcoin a ‘no-brainer.’ Petersen’s campaign amassed just south of $10,000 and became renowned for having received the largest ever single cryptocurrency contribution of 0.284 Bitcoin ($4,500 at the time) in December 2017. This figure doesn’t quite add up with the FEC guidelines even for fiat contributions, but the donation page on Petersen’s website gives a hint to how this could be legitimized:“The maximum amount an individual may contribute is $2,700 per election. Your contribution (up to $2,700) will be designated for the primary election. The next $2,700 will be designated for the general election.”Democratic candidate for Congress from New York, Nelson proclaimed that his is a ‘21st century campaign,’ which readily embraces ‘technology like #bitcoin.’ He later faced crypto fundraising issues when BitPay, a service that his campaign used for processing crypto donations, ran into licensing trouble with the state of New York.Forde is well situated to become a new political crypto star. A Democrat seeking election to the U.S. House to represent the 45th Congressional District of California this year, he had worked as both head of digital currency at MIT Media Lab and a tech adviser for the Obama administration. His embrace of the technology is explicit, and his electoral chances look solid. The crypto community has already acknowledged its unequivocal support of his candidacy by funneling a record-breaking $66,000 worth of crypto to his wallets in August and September of 2017 alone, while the biggest names in the industry pledged their support.Even though the weight of cryptocurrency contributions in campaign funds remains modest, the overall upward trend is consistent with the increasing degree of mass adoption. There is little doubt that we will soon see more campaigns funded exclusively by crypto, as well as more successful bids relying at least partly on digital currency contributions. As these processes unfold, the FEC will be compelled to chart clearer rules and grapple with the problem of crypto donations’ limited traceability.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Politics    #Elections  
"Low Capitalization, Institutional Exposure Make Crypto Low Risk, Says Dutch Gov’t Report",Helen Partz,6/3/2018 13:50,16704,334,"A branch of the Dutch government has recently released an economic risk report, claiming that cryptocurrencies present a low risk to financial stability in the country, according to a report published on May 29.The CPB states in the report that at the current time, cryptocurrencies pose a low risk to the financial system due to the low level of capitalization, as well as the limited involvement of traditional financial institutions and systems. The CPB separately noted the problems associated with crypto’s use in crime financing, fraud, high crypto market volatility, and the energy consumption of crypto mining.The report predicts that crypto-related risks will increase with more interaction with government financial institutions. The agency also states that cryptocurrencies are not “money substitutes,” claiming that users generally prefer to hold their crypto instead of using it as an everyday payment method.The report stressed the need for balanced financial regulation. The CPB compared the risks of a lack of financial regulation equally with strict regulations, claiming that overly harsh measures can increase the activity of “shadow banks.”The CPB has been tasked with providing a financial risk report at the request of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry on Financial Assistance every year since 2012. Affirming the low negative impact of crypto on financial stability, the CPB claimed that the most important financial risks are currently low interest rates and the involved risks of reducing the sustainability of debts on a macroeconomic level.Earlier this year, a Dutch court recognized Bitcoin (BTC) as a “transferable value,” declaring that the major cryptocurrency “shows characteristics of a property right.” In the case, the court ordered the defendant party to pay a debt in Bitcoin. By the court’s reasoning, since the obligation of the defendant was originally made in BTC, the amount should likewise be paid back.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Netherlands    #Cryptocurrencies    #Finance    #Economy    #Payments  
Central Bank Of Russia: Crypto Assets Do Not Pose Risk to Global Financial Stability,Ana Alexandre,5/31/2018 14:10,12753,364,"The Central Bank of Russia released a report May 30, stating that crypto assets do not currently threaten global financial stability as the global volume of crypto transactions is very low.The research paper states that instead of the term “cryptocurrency,” the Financial Stability Board proposes to use the term “crypto asset,” which can be considered a financial asset based on the application of cryptography and distributed ledger technology.According to the report, crypto assets do not pose a risk to global financial stability, because at present the volume of crypto asset transactions is very low compared to the scale of the global financial system. The relation of this segment to the financial system is insignificant, according to the report.The paper states that crypto assets could constitute a risk to financial stability in the case of further market growth, large-scale involvement of retail and institutional investors, banks, and other market players. According the the central bank’s report, the high price volatility of crypto assets prevents them from being a reliable standard of value, means of exchange, and store of value.Additionally, the paper outlines several risks connected to investment in crypto assets, including the lack of protection of investor rights, risks in the field of preventing money laundering and terrorism financing, lack of market liquidity, operational risks, and the use of leverage.Earlier this month, the Russian State Duma approved the first reading of new legislation to regulate the crypto industry. The laws define cryptocurrencies and tokens as property, and lay out specifications for interacting with crypto and blockchain-related technologies.Last week, Russian bank Sberbank CIB and the National Settlement Depository announced a pilot of the country’s first official Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Head of Sberbank CIB Igor Bulantsev said the bank considers the Russian ICO market to be “highly promising,” emphasizing that many of the bank’s clients “are interested in this new way of fundraising.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies    #Adoption  
Quebec Gov’t Reportedly Lifts Moratorium on Energy Sales to Crypto Miners,Ana Alexandre,5/31/2018 14:10,9600,230,"The government of Quebec will reportedly lift its moratorium on the sale of electricity to cryptocurrency miners, sources familiar with the matter told local news Le Journal De Montreal May 30. According to Le Journal, the Quebec government wants to “avoid missing the ship” on cryptocurrency, and as such is moving ahead to lift the moratorium.The Minister of Energy, Pierre Moreau, will reportedly introduce a decree on the regulation of electrical power sale to cryptocurrencies  miners, who require massive amounts of power for their operations. Back in February, Moreau said that ""we must ensure that this type of business is controlled, so that Hydro-Québec does not see all of its production capacity absorbed.""Over 100 organizations with a total energy consumption exceeding 10 TWh have made requests to purchase power from Hydro-Québec. Hydro-Québec operates some 60 hydroelectric generating stations, with a surplus capacity of roughly 13 TWh.According to Le Journal, such a high demanded was completely unanticipated. In January, Hydro-Québec CEO Eric Martel said they were expecting to sell five TWh to the crypto mining sector in the coming years.The decree would reportedly set different rates for digital currency miners and allow energy companies to practice “forced offloading.” In other words, Hydro-Québec will be able to cut off power to miners during the 100 to 300 hours per year when the Quebec power grid is at maximum capacity. Hydro-Québec spokesman Marc-Antoine Pouliot said:""Having interruptible customers during these critical periods makes it possible to connect more,"" adding that, ""[Hydro-Québec's mandate] is to ensure the implementation of cryptocurrencies in Quebec by maximizing economic benefits and ensuring the stability of our electricity supply.”In March, the Quebec government said it was “not interested” in providing cheap electricity to Bitcoin miners, adding that supporting crypto mining at a discount without any sort of “added value” for the local economy was unfavorable.In April, Chelan Public Utility District commissioners in the US state of Washington ordered staff to enforce their moratorium on cryptocurrency mining following the discovery of unauthorized mining activities. Each mining point discovered by the commissioners was consuming enough electricity to cause concern for fire safety, as the facilities were not designed for industrial loads.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Canada    #Cryptocurrencies    #Mining    #Government  
Bank Shutout Forces Major Polish Crypto Exchange to Move to Malta,Ana Alexandre,5/31/2018 18:15,15369,327,"BitBay, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Poland, has decided to suspend its activities in the country as banks will no longer cooperate with the company, the exchange announced May 29. The exchange will instead be conducted by a new supplier in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Malta, where local laws are more crypto-friendly.BitBay states that their business in Poland is contingent upon cooperation with national banks, but the last Polish bank ready to provide services to the exchange decided to cease its business with the exchange at the end May.BitBay will terminate the user contract to provide services, observing a notice period of one month which expires on September 17. After May 31, users will no longer be able to access their accounts in Polish z?otys (PLN), while all other functions of the exchange will be active. Following the notice period, that is after September 17, users will only be able to withdraw funds. As of that date all trading activities on the exchange in Poland will be suspended.According to the press release, users will be able to create a new account once BitBay resumes operations in Malta. The exchange will be conducted by a new supplier, but will use the bitbay.net domain name and BitBay trademark.BitBay’s relocation comes amid a wake of toughening policy from the Polish government toward cryptocurrencies. Though Poland officially recognizes digital currency mining and trading, the government’s overall stance in regards to crypto has become more critical in recent months.In the beginning of May, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) placed a tender order of around $173,000 to plan and conduct a social media campaign focused on the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, pyramid schemes, and forex trading. In February, the Central bank of Poland paid about $25,000 to produce an anti-crypto video in collaboration with Polish YouTube partner network Gamellon, Google Ireland Limited, and Facebook Ireland Limited.BitBay currently trades 29 different digital assets and at press time has a market capitalization of $9,270,725.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Poland    #Cryptocurrencies    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Malta    #Banks

Iran: Crypto Adoption or Rejection?,Gareth Jenkinson,5/29/2018 15:35,14353,233,"A major benefit of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is the ability to send funds across the world far quicker than through conventional methods.This allows people to bypass traditional foreign exchanges and international bank transfers, that can takes days or weeks to process the transfer of funds between countries.It also offers a solution to millions of people that live in countries that are affected by international sanctions. The likes of Iran have had to endure the consequences of economic isolation for years, which affects the day to day lives of its citizens.In 2015, Iran had economic sanctions lifted after the country agreed to dial down its nuclear programme to meet standards set out by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Before this, the country was separated from the international banking system through a ban from using SWIFT - the network used by financial systems to send and receive and track transactions.The 2015 lift on sanctions offered Iran a slight reprieve after years of being shut out by the global economy on numerous fronts.The ability to use cryptocurrency to move money out of the country has already been noted in Iran. Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs chairman Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi says citizens have moved $2.5 bln out of the country in cryptocurrency.That was a driving factor in Iran’s central bank decision to prohibit domestic banks and financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrencies.As quoted by Bloomberg, the Iranian Central Bank has drawn a clear line in the sand, with concerns of money laundering through the use of cryptocurrencies:“All branches of banks, credit institutions and currency exchanges should stay clear of any sale or purchase of these currencies and avoid undertakings that facilitate or promote such currencies. Action will be taken against those who contravene the regulations.”The move has also been led by government efforts to unify the rules and regulations of its currency markets and rates - due to a slide in the value of Iran’s national currency, the rial.This has come to a head after US president Donald Trump announced that America would withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal that was brokered back in 2015.That deal originally saw Iran agree to taper down its nuclear programme and allow more international inspections.In February, the IAEA had said that Iran was still in compliance with the deal, as reported by the Independent. Nevertheless Trump’s announcement means that the country could see long-standing sanctions return in July.In a strange turn of events, and despite the central bank ban on cryptocurrency trading, Iran’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi announced at the end of April that an experimental model of a state-run cryptocurrency was ready.The Iranian virtual currency has been developed by the ICT ministry and the Iranian central bank. The idea was presented by Azari-Jahromi in February:“In a meeting with the board of directors of Post Bank on digital currencies based on the blockchain, I prescribed measures to implement the country's first cloud-based digital currency.”Azari-Jahromi says the central bank ban does not apply to the new cryptocurrency.In the wake of Trump’s decision to pull of the Iran nuclear deal, Iran and Russia are believed to be considering the use of cryptocurrencies as a means to deal with US economic sanctions that cut off the use of the SWIFT transfer system.Pourebrahimi confirmed that the Iranian central bank had been engaged to develop proposals for the use of cryptocurrencies between the two countries, and that the countries were aligned:“They [Russia] share our opinion. We said that if we manage to move this work forward, then we will be the first countries that use cryptocurrency in the exchange of goods.”The geopolitical situation surrounding Iran is out of the hands of the common man on the street, yet Iranian people have managed to stay tech savvy over the years.Arame Bandari, a researcher at Iran Blockchain Labs, told Cointelegraph that despite the imposition of tough international sanctions, his compatriots have kept up with the rest of the world:“As you know, Iran has faced various type of sanctions during last 40 years, but you should consider that Iranian young educated population is always adapted with the latest technological developments.”Nevertheless Bandari concedes that the environment has made life difficult for research and development. This has been curtailed somewhat by the Iranian government’s willingness to nurture education and tech development:“During last 5 years, we have witnessed a lot of good governmental supports toward knowledge-base economy and we've observed that a plenty of knowledge/technology-based SMEs [small to medium enterprises] have flourished.”According to the researcher, there is a health startup ecosystem established in the Iranian capital Tehran, as well as Esfahan and Shiraz. This has led to the construction and establishment of technology parks, incubators, crowdfunding platforms and business accelerators - ‘paving the way for the implementation of a technology/knowledge based economy’.Bandari also believes that it could well be possible for Iran to use cryptocurrencies to facilitate trade with countries like Russia.However, he also emphasized the recent government crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies has been tough. The exit of a huge volume of rials forced the Iranian government’s hand, and Bandari said exchange platforms would shut down services in the weeks ahead.European University at Saint-Petersburg senior lecturer of political economy Nikolay Kozhanov, expert on Iranian external affairs, spoke to Cointelegraph about the geopolitical possibilities of the use of cryptocurrencies between the two countries.Kozhanov said Iran is considering the use of cryptocurrencies to bypass sanctions, in direct reaction to the possibility of having old sanctions restored and being cut off from the SWIFT system:“They’re looking at options to bypass these sanctions. Previously, they tried to establish direct bank connections using local currencies as payment options but the problem is that you’re taking out preferred currencies like the euro and the dollar out of these exchanges.”“The exporters of products are losing money because they’re usually playing on the difference between exchange rates between currencies. Some officials in the Iranian government and the central bank are of the understanding that cryptocurrencies could be a solution.”Kozhanov said the fact that the countries had opened discussions of using cryptocurrencies for bilateral trade and investment between Russia and Iran ‘means they’re quite serious about it.’The burning question is if and when the two countries could adopt cryptocurrencies as a means to facilitate trade. As Kozhanov explains, it’s not an easy prediction to make.“To be honest I’m not sure, first of all it’s going to be first experience of using cryptocurrencies to facilitate trade. Iran hasn’t done it before so to a certain extent, it’s an experiment. Secondly the decision has not even been taken yet  in Iran itself.”Another mitigating factor is the complex relationship between the Iranian government and Islamic law:“Iran is governed in accordance with Islamic laws, which heavily regulate the banking sphere. In general Islamic economists ban everything that is not created by work.You cannot make ‘profit out of thin air’. To my understanding, to a certain extent cryptocurrencies fall into that category.”It seems highly unlikely that Iran will be rushed into using cryptocurrencies on a national and international scale. There are too many working parts to be ironed out, and some highly complex relationships between the government and central bank as well as the application of Islamic laws.However, should fresh sanctions be imposed once again, cryptocurrencies could well open up new possibilities for the country and its place in the global economy.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Iran    #Cryptocurrencies    #Russia

(Kraken); (7) Bittrex, Inc.; (8) Circle Internet Financial Limited (Poloniex LLC); (9) Binance Limited; (10) Elite Way Developments LLP (Tidex.com); (11) Gate Technology Incorporated (Gate.io); (12) itBit Trust Company; and (13) Huobi Global Limited (Huobi.Pro), include entities that operate in New York and have successfully completed the BitLicense application process as well as those that have carved out any New York presence and block New York consumers from their platforms. Specifically, the Inquiries seek information on a number of topics of concern, including: ownership and control of the Exchange, operations and fee structure, trading policies and policies on suspensions of trading, internal controls and compliance with respect to privacy and AML and seek corresponding disclosures around the approach of each Exchange with respect to combating suspicious trading and market manipulation; their policies on the operation of bots; their limitations on the use of and access to non-public trading information; and the safeguards they have in place to protect customer funds from theft, fraud, and other risks.The OAG press release cites that the OAG, as New York’s chief law enforcement agency, has an interest in the requested information as it is “the Attorney General’s duty to protect [New York] consumers and ensure the fairness and integrity of [New York’s] financial markets.” The press release cites undisclosed “published reports” which indicate the “sector” has “attracted fraudsters, market manipulators, and thieves” which, in their view, brings the whole “sector” into the purview of the OAG as it “is responsible for protecting consumers and investors from these bad actors and ensuring the fairness and integrity of New York’s financial markets.”  In response, it appears all of the Exchanges have indicated a willingness to work with the OAG with the exception of Kraken, which, through a number of social media posts, has been vocal in its unwillingness to engage with the OAG in this exercise. In fact, it’s CEO has explicitly outlined many of its issues with the Inquiry as well as some suggested policy prescriptions here. Kraken also ponders about the true intent of the Inquiry, indicating it may be a publicity stunt.Given New York State’s history of interactions in the crypto space, which include the BitLicense but also more recently the announcements of electricity tariffs that hit crypto mining companies, many are speculating as to the purpose of the Inquiry as well as the intent behind the broader Initiative.The stated purpose of the Inquiry is to conduct “a fact-finding inquiry into the policies and practices of platforms used by consumers to trade virtual or “crypto” currencies … requesting key information on their operations, internal controls, and safeguards to protect customer assets” with a relatively benign end goal of analyzing “the responses, compar[ing] them across platforms, and at the conclusion of this process, present[ing] what [was] learned to the public.” While the results may be of interest to regulators and the public, the Inquiry is an aggressive move coming from the OAG from a number of perspectives: these types of inquiries into entities that operate on a national and international scale are more appropriately conducted by one or more federal regulators. The CFTC and SEC in particular have expressed concern over the lack of direct federal oversight of market practices with respect to these exchanges, including questioning whether the current state-by-state regime is appropriate.more than half of the Exchanges that received requests have chosen not to interact with New York, many in reaction to the BitLicense regulatory regime. This gives New York less of a vested interest in regulating the behaviors of those Exchanges than many other U.S. states where these Exchanges would have an unfettered (subject to compliance with applicable law) ability to interact with the residents of those states.(as Kraken has pointed out) New York should already have comfort on a number of the subjects in the information requests for the Exchanges that went through the BitLicense application process and received the Bitlicense or a trust charter, as this is a regulatory regime suited for banks and financial institutions that includes requirements around compliance, internal controls, and cybersecurity. Further, New York State’s Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) recently issued guidance to the BitLicensed Exchanges, reminding them to implement measures to detect, prevent and respond to fraud while being vigilant against market manipulation.The OAG, seemingly somewhat self-aware enough to acknowledge that they are potentially stepping into the existing realm of jurisdiction of New York State’s Department of Financial Services (“DFS”), again as far as it relates to the Exchanges with an actual nexus to New York, notes that their role in this sector is “is separate from, but complementary to,” that of DFS, which, in their words “established a first-in-the-nation licensing protocol that requires virtual currency trading platforms and other firms engaged in virtual currency business activities to receive approval to operate and follow certain regulatory requirements.”While it is also notable that the language in the request itself contains less bravado than the press release and is more conciliatory, the OAG will be able to change its tune to the extent New York residents have wrangled their way onto Exchanges despite efforts to block them. The request describes the recipients as being targeted due to their status as “major virtual currency trading platforms” rather than alleging that all have a substantiated nexus to New York and words the Inquiry as a “request [of] the participation of [the Exchange] in OAG’s Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative, which seeks to protect the interests of New York residents who trade virtual currency and related investment products.”The OAG acknowledges the potentially tenuous nature of any assertion of jurisdiction over other Exchanges in the sample through the footnote stating that the OAG is “aware that certain trading platforms have formal rules barring access in New York and may not have a license to engage in virtual currency business activity in New York.”  Among other topics, we are asking platforms to describe their measures for restricting trading from prohibited jurisdictions.” This line of questioning is the most dangerous for those that purport to have no nexus to New York as many implement the ban of New York users by (at a minimum) blocking New York based IP addresses, which is known to be less than foolproof. See, e.g. this article on getting around geo-blocking. The OAG is well aware of this, when prompted on Kraken’s refusal to engage them, subsequently citing that they have enforcement jurisdiction over foreign and out of state companies that operate in New York (ie. interact with New York consumers).In all, to the extent the Inquiry is not publicity stunt or a fishing expedition for data to underpin a fact finding that the BitLicense regulatory regime has resulted in heightened compliance standards, internal controls and the professionalization of those Exchanges that are subject to it, the goals and broader path forward for the OAG’s Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative remains a mystery – a mystery further clouded by the very recent departure of attorney general Schneiderman. However, to the extent pursued actively by Mr. Scheiderman’s successors, it may well be the state’s first step into regulating the crypto markets under New York’s Martin Act, which gives the OAG broad authority to investigate violations of the same.Despite the long term direction of the Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative, this seems to be another shaky step forward by New York in its attempts to produce cutting edge regulatory oversight in the crypto space and one that does not seem well coordinated with New York’s existing regulations under DFS or federal regulators. It is also a step taken at a time where there have been increasingly vocal calls to rethink the existing state patchwork of laws in the crypto space – replacing the current regulatory regime with coordinated and coherent regulation at a national and international level. It seems that New York, in continuing to aggressively seek a role as watchdog and regulator of the crypto markets, may be throwing accelerant on the fire under federal regulators to solidify a federal scheme that would serve to preempt the states in this space.Sarah H.

"SEC, CFTC, IRS And Others: A Guide To US Regulating Bodies",Stephen O'Neal,5/28/2018 9:50,20892,457,"On May 22, 2018  the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an advisory statement for listing virtual currency derivative products. The statement is aimed at providing clarity for exchanges and clearing houses. Previously this week, major US cryptocurrency exchange and wallet Coinbase spoke to regulators about obtaining a federal banking charter.Those events came in the midst of uncertainty regarding the status of crypto in the US, as federal regulatory bodies still haven’t come up with one definitive scheme to regulate Bitcoin, altcoins and initial coin offerings (ICOs). There are currently a number of federal regulators involved in crypto, and all of those bodies view cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin differently - defining it as a security, money, property or a commodity. Furthermore, on a state to state level, some additional regulations may apply.With the absence of one definitive regulatory framework at the federal level, cryptocurrencies in the country fall into various categories, all of which must be considered.In the US, Congress holds supreme power over federal regulatory agencies such as the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enforcing them to comply with the laws it issues. Now that Congress is silent on the matter, each regulatory agency views cryptocurrency from its perspective, which is why it’s possible for different agencies to claim concurrent authority over the same actions… This means that US citizens must abide by the existing regulatory schemes of all the various agencies, even if they conflict.The SEC, which regulates securities transactions, mostly considers crypto as securities. According to the 70 year old Howey Test, which the SEC applies to determine the purview of its jurisdiction, a security involves the investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts. Last year, the agency issued a marker opinion on digital assets, claiming that ICOs can sometimes be considered securities and therefore are subject to strict laws and regulations. Recently, the SEC elaborated on its views regarding crypto and said that it is looking to apply securities laws to everything from cryptocurrency exchanges to wallets.ICOs appear to be the agency’s primary focus, as in February 2018 the SEC came through with a sweeping probe, issuing subpoenas to shut down a number of “unregistered securities” among ICOs. Prior to that, SEC chairman Jay Clayton accused “many promoters of ICOs and cryptocurrencies” of not complying with securities laws. Whilst he previously recognized ICOs as “potentially efficient fundraising tools”, in a op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, Clayton also warned that “The SEC will vigorously pursue those who seek to evade the registration, disclosure and anti-fraud requirements of our securities laws.”In a hearing at the US House of Representatives in April, William Hinman, the director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, explained why his agency had not completely banned ICOs, hinting that the SEC leans towards “a balanced approach” regarding digital assets and coin offerings, and that the area that “continues to evolve”.Hinman also followed previous comments from Clayton that most ICOs should be considered securities. According to Hinman, the SEC would be consulting with entities releasing tokens to verify that the offerings were either regulated or not qualified as securities. When asked if he could think of an instance in which an ICO would not be seen as the offering of a security, Hinman replied:“In theory, there is a time when a coin may achieve a sort of decentralized utility in the marketplace. There are some coins where you wouldn’t have an issuer to regulate…. In theory, there may be coins where that lack of a central actor would make it difficult to regulate… as a securities offering.”Recently, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson called the ICO market a prime example of an unregulated securities market in an interview with CNBC:""If you want to know what our markets would look like with no securities regulation, what it would look like if the SEC didn't do its job? The answer is the ICO market”Jackson also said that he hasn’t yet seen an ICO that wasn’t a security and currently, there are no ICOs that registered with the SEC. However, in early March, The Praetorian Group filed with the agency to register their ICO as a security offering; if their application is accepted, they will become the first company to hold an SEC-regulated ICO.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)What’s that?

Enforces economic sanctions in support of U.S. national security and foreign policyHow does it view crypto? Money, or fiat currenciesThe CFTC, a body that fully controls commodity derivatives transactions, claims that tokens are commodities. That means that in their view, Bitcoin (BTC) is closer to gold than to conventional currencies or securities, as it is not backed by the government and doesn’t have a liability attached to it. The CFTC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies as commodities has been recently backed up by a New York federal judge.As CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz explained, “crypto-tokens offered in a pre-sale can transform. They may start their life as a security regulated under the SEC from a capital-raising perspective but then at some point – maybe possibly quickly or even immediately – turn into a commodity.""The CFTC has shown some pro-Bitcoin leanings, granting LedgerX the right to create a regulated Bitcoin futures market. Moreover, J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission and self-proclaimed “cryptodad” - that hashtag was briefly featured in his Twitter bio - has gained the reputation of a rather cryptofriendly regulator, although he will leave office in 2019 as his term expires. In February, he said:“We owe it this new generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies with a thoughtful and balanced response, not a dismissive one.”Despite having dissimilar definitions of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC has been collaborating with the SEC. In February, the agencies held a highly anticipated hearing, where they gave credit to the cryptocurrency industry for adding a new paradigm to the financial system, stressed the importance of fair regulatory frameworks and famously said that “if there was no Bitcoin, there would be no blockchain”.The CTFC also made its priorities clear. The agency stressed its interest in allowing growth for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, while focusing on fraudsters in ICOs. That seems to be the main direction for federal regulators at the moment. After dealing with unlawful ICOs, the various regulatory agencies might proceed to tackle more difficult issues, like what makes a token a security, a commodity, money or a utility.The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen), a bureau of the Treasury Department that has full authority for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) matters, considers tokens to be money. In other words, under the FinCen’s jurisdiction, ICO sales are subject to the money transmitter rules under the Bank Secrecy Act, and therefore are required to register with the government, collect information about their customers, and report any suspicious financial activities.In March, FinCen disclosed in a letter written by its Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Drew Maloney to senator Ron Wyden, that the agency will apply its regulations to ICOs, stating that “an exchange that sells ICO coins or tokens, or exchanges them for other virtual currency, fiat currency, or other value that substitutes for currency, would typically… be a money transmitter"". The regulatory body mentioned that “approximately 100 virtual currency exchanges” are registered with the FinCen, and reminded about their policing action against Ripple Labs in 2015 and BTC-e in 2017.However, in that letter, FinCen also recognized that “ICO arrangements vary”, and that “certain participants could fall under authority of the SEC, which regulates brokers and dealers in securities, or under the authority of CFTC, which regulates brokers and dealers in security”.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) thinks that cryptocurrencies are not currencies, but properties, meaning that if you sell your cryptocurrencies for a profit you will be subject to a capital gains tax. In 2014, the agency issued guidance on how cryptos should be taxed. According to Notice 2014-21, received or mined cryptocurrencies must be included in computing gross income with fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date it was received.In an Expert Take for Cointelegraph, Robert W. Wood, a San Francisco-based tax lawyer of Wood LLP, explained the nuances of paying taxes for crypto, reminding that with the agency using software for tracking purposes and the summons of Coinbase, the IRS hunt for cryptocurrency isn’t going away.On March 23, the IRS released a memo reminding US citizens of the need to report their digital currency earnings on their income tax returns. The agency also highlighted the “inherently pseudo-anonymous aspect” of cryptocurrency transactions.But, as the stats show, people are hardly paying their taxes on crypto. A couple of days before the taxes deadline in the US, the Credit Karma Tax platform told CNBC that less than 100 people have reported capital gains from crypto investments out of the 250,000 most recent tax filers. In February, at the beginning of tax season, Credit Karma reported the very same numbers, 100 out of 250,000, or 0.04 percent of tax filers reported gains on crypto in 2017. In 2015, the IRS reported that only 802 people in total had crypto gains and losses in their tax filings.The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency of the US Treasury Department that enforces economic sanctions in support of US national security and foreign policy, seems to treat cryptocurrencies as money, or fiat currencies. In March, the agency updated its FAQ with a section on virtual currency.Essentially, as an international tax attorney Selva Ozelli explains in an Expert Take for Cointelegraph, under OFAC’s new guidance, US citizens will have the same sanctions compliance obligations regardless of whether transactions involve fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies. In other words, sanctions violations involving crypto are going to be treated similarly to those involving fiat currencies.Moreover, the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDNL) curated by the OFAC is going to be updated with digital currency addresses or wallets of people featured in it. As Ozelli points out, “this would put US persons on notice that doing business with those digital addresses may be prohibited, increasing compliance considerations for businesses delving into the world of virtual currency.”Thus, the program mechanism looks similar to KYC procedure, which includes sanctions list screening and other relevant measures. Those who fail to comply with OFAC’s regulations may face significant civil and criminal penalties.Although it’s not completely clear how OFCA will obtain crypto wallets of those on the SDNL, in March, classified documents obtained by Edward Snowden revealed that The US National Security Agency (NSA) managed to create a system to track down and deanonymize cryptocurrency users.In a recent hearing entitled “Examining Cryptocurrencies and ICO Markets” that took place in Washington, Coinbase, one of the largest mainstream wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges, voiced their concerns regarding the patchy state of regulation in the US and how it is “chilling” the market.Mike Lempres, Chief Legal and Risk Officer at Coinbase, stressed that the “tremendous potential” of the digital currency’s technology can be only achieved through “responsible regulation.”, while at the current stage, the US regulatory system “is harming healthy innovation” due to a lack of understanding of what should be allowed and what should be not, and how digital assets should be considered; either as securities, commodities, property, or money.“There is so much uncertainty about the definition of a security and the scope of regulatory control that the market is being chilled. This is bad for everyone because the technology won’t stop?—?it will simply move overseas and we will miss out on the opportunity to cultivate the benefits in the U.S.”Lempres pinpointed “a lack of coordination” between federal regulators and stated that Coinbase cannot start supporting ICOs until the necessary regulations are adopted.Defining cryptocurrencies as an asset is indeed tricky: some cryptocurrencies might look like securities, while others act like commodities. It is also fair to suggest that most cryptocurrencies have some qualities of each. The CFTC chairman’s statement echoes that sentiment, as he suggests that despite all complexities, a regulatory framework isn’t coming any time soon.Nevertheless, the future for crypto in the US might be bright after all. Most US regulators seem to be quite ""cryptofriendly"" because they don't want to stifle innovation and would like to keep blockchain businesses in the country, but at the same time they want to protect individuals from bad actors. It's a difficult balancing act, one that requires pragmatism and time.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #CFTC    #SEC    #USA  
UK Financial Regulator Opens 24 Investigations Into Crypto Businesses for Compliance,William Suberg,5/27/2018 12:50,21830,288,"UK authorities have opened 24 investigations into cryptocurrency businesses over financial regulatory compliance, local media outlet CityWire reported May 25.Responding to a freedom of information request, regulator the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also confirmed it had opened seven whistleblower reports since the start of the year.While the FCA did not mention which specific businesses were on its radar, a response to CityWire stated that the investigations were being made in order to “determine whether they might be carrying on regulated activities that require FCA authorisation.”Addressing possible consequences of its own investigation, the FCA meanwhile appeared to hint it would take action according to the seriousness of any offending business, without mentioning which parameters it would use to judge activities.According to the FCA’s response, the investigations’ priority is consumer protection:“If we conclude that they are, then we may investigate and take action, identifying and determining the most serious matters which pose the greatest risk to consumers.”The FCA’s investigations join regulatory steps currently underway in other major jurisdictions regarding crypto business compliance.Earlier this week, a joint U.S.-Canada investigation dubbed ‘Operation Cryptosweep’ was opened, targeting potentially fraudulent industry investment programs. Investigators have so far unearthed around 35, a press release from the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) announced.Across the globe in Singapore, the central bank issued warnings May 24 to eight local crypto exchanges that could potentially be breaking securities laws. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also confirmed it had sent a demand to one ICO token issuer to halt its activities.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #United Kingdom    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
Bank of England Governor: Open to the Idea of a Central Bank Digital Currency,Aaron Wood,5/27/2018 11:55,25719,586,"The Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney said at the Riksbank Anniversary conference that he was open-minded about the prospect of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Bloomberg reports May 25. Riksbank is the central bank of Sweden.While he reportedly is not opposed to the idea of implementing a CBDC, Carney stressed that any such adoption of a digital currency would not happen soon. The UK central bank governor stated that cryptocurrencies do not currently constitute money. In February of this year, Carney sharply criticized cryptocurrency at an event at London’s Regent’s University, saying that, “It [cryptocurrency] has pretty much failed thus far on... the traditional aspects of money. It is not a store of value because it is all over the map. Nobody uses it as a medium of exchange.""Earlier this month, the Bank of England issued a working paper, laying out various scenarios of possible financial risks and instability issues of using a CBDC. The report found that in the scenarios described, there was no reason to believe that adopting a CBDC would negatively impact private credit or total liquidity provision to the economy.At the 350th anniversary of Riksbank on May 25, Carney stressed that the “past, present, and future” of central banks have and do depend on maintaining public trust in the financial system. He added that, since Brexit, the Bank of England has overhauled their financial system which would make it more resilient to shocks such as those following the brinkmanship of events like Brexit.Other central banks in Europe have also considered adopting a CBDC. Earlier this month, Norwegian central bank Norges Bank issued a working paper in which they consider developing a CBDC as a supplement to cash to “ensure confidence in money and the monetary system.” The aforementioned Riksbank is also considering an e-krona as the use of banknotes and coins declines in Sweden.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Central Bank    #Adoption    #Government  
Shenzhen Gov't Partners With Tencent to Fight Tax Fraud With Blockchain,Ana Alexandre,5/27/2018 3:00,16057,250,"The Shenzhen Municipal Office of the State Administration of Taxation has partnered with technology firm Tencent, according to an official announcement May 25. The partnership aims to establish an “Intelligent Tax” Innovation Laboratory focused on tax management modernization and fighting tax fraud with blockchain technology.On May 24th, the Chinese regulator and Tencent signed an agreement on establishing an “Intelligent Tax” Innovation Laboratory. The newfound organization will reportedly employ cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data to improve taxation management and find a technological solution to fraudulent fapiao, according to China Money Network.A fapiao is an official invoice issued by the Chinese Tax Bureau for goods and services purchased in the country, which helps the government to track tax payments. However, there is a large underground market in the country for counterfeit or copied fapiao. Buyers use fraudulent receipts to evade taxes or defraud employers, claiming falsified expenditures for which they are reimbursed.According to China Money Network, vendors for fake fapiao can be found easily in crowded urban areas, such as subway exits, and outdoor marketplaces.The digital invoice solution based on the Tencent blockchain will reportedly be the first product of the laboratory, as well as the nation’s first blockchain-based research on the application of invoices. Li Wei, deputy director of the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of State Taxation, said:“The digital invoice based on blockchain technology has features such as complete traceability of the whole process and non-disruptive information, which consistent with invoice logic, can effectively avoid false invoices, and improve the invoice supervision process.”Since 2015, Tencent has used its technology to aid local tax bureaus in China. Shenzhen residents can use the vastly popular app WeChat to declare and pay taxes, as well as to get fapiao.Earlier this week, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published a Blockchain Industry White Paper, revealing that the domestic blockchain industry saw “exponential” growth in 2017. The report states that “blockchain technology has risen to the level of a national science and technology strategy,” noting that China’s policy and regulatory framework for blockchain has “gradually improved”.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Government    #Adoption    #Taxes  
US: Shipping Startup Refutes Claims of Securities Laws Violations by State Regulator,Aaron Wood,5/28/2018 12:45,15803,184,"Logistics and supply chain startup ShipChain has refuted the claim of South Carolina regulators that it ran afoul of state securities laws, according to a statement May 24.Earlier this week, the company was issued a cease-and-desist order from the South Carolina Attorney General’s office. The order stated that ShipChain was offering securities to state residents without being registered as a broker-dealer by the proper authorities. The offerings in question are the SHIP tokens, which can be used to make transactions on the startup’s Ethereum-based platform. In their statement, ShipChain says that the state commissioner did not contact them to verify any of the claims leveled against the company. According to ShipChain, their private token sale was conducted in accordance with applicable securities laws, and that it was held in January, before the company moved its development team to the state of South Carolina.ShipChain claims that they have not been “offering, issuing, or selling” tokens since the private sale, nor do they have plans to do so “in the foreseeable future.” The firm also maintains that tokens were only sold to qualified investors, among whom none were South Carolina businesses or residents. They state:“ShipChain is not aware that SHIPs were even offered in South Carolina or to any South Carolinian during the private sale.”According to the cease-and-desist order, the company has 30 days to request a hearing to clarify the matter.On May 21, US and Canadian state and provincial securities regulators opened probes into potentially fraudulent crypto businesses in an initiative dubbed “Operation Cryptosweep.” Regulators from 40 jurisdictions coordinated by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) have started up to 70 investigations, with more reported to follow in the coming weeks. ",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Law    #Government  
"South Africa’s Central Bank Calls Crypto ‘Cyber-Tokens’, Not Currency",Ana Alexandre,5/25/2018 18:10,12933,220,"The South African Reserve Bank, the central bank of the Republic, has chosen to call digital currencies “cyber-tokens” because they “don’t meet the requirements of money,” Bloomberg reported May 24.Francois Groepe, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor, explained the position of the bank:“We don’t use the term “cryptocurrency” because it doesn’t meet the requirements of money in the economic sense of the stable means of exchange, a unit of measure and a stable unit of value. We prefer to use the word ‘cyber-token’.”The Reserve Bank has established a fintech task force to review its stance toward private cryptocurrencies and address regulatory issues in order to develop a relevant policy framework and regulatory system. Groepe said:“We want to ensure or establish whether there is still compliance with the relevant financial surveillance or exchange-control regulations.”Central banks around the world have approached cryptocurrencies with varying degrees of skepticism and disapproval. In February, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney declared that Bitcoin cannot be considered a legitimate currency by “traditional” definitions, because it failed to meet two major requirements of a traditional currency. He claimed that Bitcoin is neither a means of exchange, nor a store of value.Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) issued a circular ordering all financial institutions to stop servicing cryptocurrency exchanges and begin to liquidate existing crypto-related accounts. Head of the RBZ Norman Mataruka explained the decision, saying that the RBZ has an “obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems”, and the central bank is not prepared to provide such a safeguard for crypto.In April, the Royal Bank of India issued a similar circular, announcing that the bank will no longer provide services to any individual dealing in cryptocurrency. The Indian Supreme Court has upheld the bank’s decision following the submission of petitions to have the ban lifted. The case will be heard again in July.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Africa    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Government  
"More Americans Will Turn to Crypto If Fed Relaxes Post-2008 Measures, Analysts Say",Marie Huillet,5/28/2018 12:40,15743,405,"More Americans may move away from traditional finance and into crypto if the the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) relaxes post-2008 financial regulations, according to a study published by Weiss Ratings May 22.The Fed is set to meet on May 30 to consider watering down the “Volcker Rule,” in what would be a major deregulatory move. The relaxing of the “Volcker Rule” would allow thousands of banks to make high risk profit-seeking trades with less government oversight.If the Fed’s plans go ahead, increased systemic financial risk could well push citizens to conclude that “cryptocurrencies do a fundamentally better job as a safe depository,” Weiss analysts argue.According to Weiss, banks are lobbying for more freedom to trade speculative assets such as derivatives, whose ownership is “extremely centralized.”“These potentially toxic assets [such as derivatives] are not simply investments and speculations banks make with their own capital,” but pose risk to clients’ own deposits in the event of another major system crisis, Weiss claims.Weiss argues that while the public on average assumes that banks provide them with “simple, safe and unencumbered storage for [their] savings,” the reality is that the traditional monetary system – especially if deregulatory momentum sets in – continues to offer banks “rich rewards for excessive risk-taking.”As Cointelegraph reported last year, scandals and failures have turned public sentiment against the traditional banking system in the past, with one report finding that as many 92 percent of millennials firmly expressed their distrust of banks.Geopolitical turbulence is another threat factor, as most recently shown by the dramatic collapse of the Iranian rial in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Anticipating renewed U.S. sanctions, Iranian citizens preemptively withdrew $2.5 bln in crypto out of the country.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Investments    #Cryptocurrencies  
Russia’s Largest Bank to Pilot First Official ICO,Marie Huillet,5/25/2018 13:05,14523,302,"Russian bank Sberbank CIB and the National Settlement Depository (NRD) will pilot the country’s first official Initial Coin Offering (ICO) using the Bank of Russia’s regulatory sandbox, ForkLog reports today, May 24.Sberbank CIB, the investment banking arm of major state-owned bank Sberbank, and NRD, which is part of the Moscow Stock Exchange Group, are now finalizing plans with the central bank to launch the project by the end of summer 2018.Sberbank CIB’s head Igor Bulantsev said that the bank considers the Russian ICO market to be “highly promising,” emphasizing that many of the bank’s clients “are interested in this new way of fundraising.”The experimental ICO proceeds will reportedly be used to launch new tokenized online services by Level One, a company that runs the largest commercial lecture hall in Moscow.NRD’s Eddi Astanin told local media platform Vedemosti that the project’s tokens would only be sold for rubles and be open exclusively to “qualified” investors.The Bank of Russia announced the launch of its regulatory sandbox in mid-April this year, offering Russian fintech companies the chance to test new technologies without the risk of violating domestic law. Add.Capital investment firm partner Alexei Prokofiev told Vedemosti that the new experimental ICO promised a “real experience of understanding the legal side of the future implementation of digital tokens and blockchain.”Just this week, the Russian parliament approved the first reading of new laws regulating the crypto industry, which have been under consideration since earlier this year. The laws deal with cryptocurrencies and ICOs, defining both cryptocurrencies and tokens as property, as well as laying out specifications for interacting with crypto and blockchain-related technologies such as smart contracts and mining. Notably, the new laws state that the Bank of Russia may restrict the amount of crypto transactions for anyone who is not a qualified investor.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies  
"Poland Continues Its Aggression Towards Crypto, But the Community Shows Force",Stephen O'Neal,5/25/2018 14:00,20373,237,"On May 10, Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) held a tender order of 615,000 zloty (around $170,000) to plan and conduct a social media campaign that will focus on the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, pyramid schemes, and forex trading.That sum is hardly impressive, but represents another gesture against crypto by the conservative Polish government, which has already admitted to its investments in FUD media activities in February. Nevertheless, the local crypto community has stood up for itself in an educational response.Poland officially recognizes trading and mining of cryptocurrencies, however the state’s overall views toward crypto seemed to become more skeptical in the past months, as a trend of suspicion toward cryptocurrencies in Poland emerged alongside the news about the Bitfinex situation, the government’s rumored interest in Petro, and the dismissal of Anna Stre?y?ska, the former crypto-friendly Minister of Digital Affairs.In February 2018, Polish journalists reported that the Central Bank of Poland paid about 91,000 zloty (around $25,000) to produce an anti-crypto video. The video was carried out in conjunction with Polish YouTube partner network Gamellon, Google Ireland Limited, and Facebook Ireland Limited, who allegedly helped to distribute the video.Dubbed “I LOST ALL THE MONEY?!,” the not-so-subtle clip contained no signs indicating that it was paid for by the government or sponsored at all. A popular Polish blogger, Marcin Dubiela, played a Gucci-wearing, Corvette-riding cryptoenterprenuer who had invested all his money in a single token, and, by the end of the video, had hit rock bottom: wearing shorts and flip flops, he takes fiat coins out of a public fountain.Previously, Polish journalist and YouTube blogger Karol Paciorek provided more details on the campaign for Cointelegraph:“There was a product placement deal between NBP and three large YouTube channels: Marcin Dubiel - 937,000 subscribers; Wi?nia - 818,000 subscribers; and Planeta Faktów - 1 mln subscribers. It’s an educational campaign paid from a government-based organization. Someone asked NBP how much they have paid for the campaign, and got an answer.”Although the video garnered more than half a million views on Dubiela’s channel alone, its effect seems doubtful. Jacek Walewski, the secretary of Polish Bitcoin Association (PBA) told Cointelegraph that the clip failed to stigmatize the perception of crypto among casual users in Poland, as it was “unprofessional and stupid”.“Central bank hired popular YouTubers among teenagers [for this activity]. But they aren't economic authorities.”Justyna Laskowska of BitBay, the largest exchange platform in Poland, says that while their service didn’t experience any client loss after the video aired, the official campaign seems toxic for the environment, as it “lacked educational value”.“We are happy to have over 800,000 loyal users, and thus we did not feel the increase in the number of closing accounts. However, the campaign made by the government certainly scared off people who wanted to learn more about cryptocurrency, and caused an unfavorable atmosphere around it.”On May 6 a small film studio uploaded a documentary on YouTube called “Krypto”, with the declared goal of educating the Polish public with basic facts about crypto and blockchain technology.The documentary’s director and screenwriter, cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast Piotr Pacewicz, told Cointelegraph that he saw Krypto as a “brick [for building] a better world, [one] with a financial system where everybody is equal”.“My main aim [was to] educate, educate and educate. Because [almost] no one knows the fundamentals about Bitcoin and blockchain.”Pacewicz says that the production “was cheaper than the NBP campaign”, although he wouldn’t disclose precise figures. To make the film, Pacewicz consulted with Szczepan Bentyn, a local crypto enthusiast and YouTuber who helped him with the contacts.  The NBP-funded video came out around the time Pacewicz started shooting Krypto. Shocked by its propagandistic tone (he referred to the video as “shit” and “a piece of crap” in the comment), Pacewicz held an “anti-fiat campaign” with “funny t-shirts” and continued working on the documentary. Now that Krypto has been publically released, he seems satisfied with the results.  “We decided to publish “Krypto” on YouTube for free and we still received very good feedback. Krypto wasn’t made as a direct response for [that] shitty anti-crypto campaign, but it’s a mature answer [nonetheless].“At the time of publication, “Krypto” has just over 22,000 views on YouTube.Despite this interchange, Polish Bitcoin Association is currently negotiating with the government on future tax regulations for cryptocurrencies, which are currently non-existent.  The task appears to be even more complex as Jacek Walewski, the spokeperson, argues that Polish politicians don’t understand cryptocurrencies at all:“Maybe just very few Polish politicians understand what Blockchain is. For example, our Prime Minister Mr. Mateusz Morawiecki compared cryptocurrencies to Amber Gold [when speaking in Davos]. Amber Gold was a big ponzi scheme [in Poland]…“Nevertheless, local reports show that representatives of right-wing parties in the country, including Alliance and the dominant Law and Justice, seem to favor blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Thus, Wojciech Murdzek of Law and Justice said:“Regulation of the cryptocurrency market is necessary because of the country’s interests. It is essential that cryptocurrency-oriented businesses remain in Poland rather than move abroad.“The liberal-conservative Civic Party seems to be supportive of crypto as well, while the leftist party Razem does not seem to have a clear stance on cryptos at the moment, however highlighting that “mining consumes a lot of energy in the era of Climate Change”.Justyna Laskowska also told Cointelegraph that BitBay representatives “are actively engaged” in discussions with the Polish government regarding the taxation of cryptocurrencies as well, as “misunderstandings and contradictory interpretations of tax regulations” have recently affected their users. After meeting with Under Secretary of State Pawe? Gruza from the Ministry of Finance, the exchange moved closer toward reaching a reasonable solution.“Although one coherent version of the regulations hasn't  been yet established, we can already see a big step forward. The unfavorable way of calculating tax for cryptocurrency traders has been withdrawn.“On May 21, Poland’s Ministry of Finance announced that it will temporarily suspend tax collection for cryptocurrencies. The Ministry states it will conduct an “in-depth analysis” of the crypto space to inform better regulation and taxation policies going forward. Previously, the Ministry of Finance had released a statement clarifying that taxation for cryptocurrency transactions fell into two income tax brackets of 18 and 32 percent. An additional one percent levy tax due to civil law agreements was also applied, as the agency considered crypto transactions as the transfer of property rights.Jacek Walewski of Polish Bitcoin Association sees regulation as inevitable but by no means a positive development:“I think that cryptocurrencies will become regularized. But [in that case] Polish companies (for example, the biggest market, BitBay) [might] move their headquarters to other countries. Why? Because they have problems with Polish banks that denounce their contracts. The number of followers of Bitcoin [in the country] is growing, but it’s a very difficult time for cryptocurrency businesses.”In her turn, BitBay’s Laskowska remains positive and business-minded. “It can still be fixed,” she believes, and the community has its force and value for the country:“[Poland has] an influential community of cryptocurrency users, who are not only traders but also specialists regarding blockchain usage. All these people can cooperate with the government to regulate the industry and make it grow. I believe that the government will see this opportunity for our country.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Poland    #Youtube    #Cryptocurrencies  
"Singapore Fires Compliance Warning at 8 Crypto Exchanges, Orders an ICO to Halt Sales",William Suberg,5/25/2018 11:25,16328,191,"Singapore’s central bank said today, May 24, that it had issued a warning to eight cryptocurrency exchanges over securities compliance and ordered an ICO to stop issuing tokens.In a press release, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reiterated operators in the city-state “are responsible for ensuring that they comply with all relevant laws.”The warnings continue the narrative put forward by authorities this year, with Singapore aiming to provide a permissive, yet regulated environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses.“The number of digital token exchanges and digital token offerings in Singapore has been increasing,” MAS’ assistant managing director of capital markets Lee Boon Ngiap commented:“We do not see a need to restrict them if they are bona fide businesses. But if any digital token exchange, issuer or intermediary breaches our securities laws, MAS will take firm action.”The press release does not name the specific exchanges and ICO issuer involved.The practice of trading digital tokens that could constitute securities under various jurisdictions – but without having official license to do so – has become a common phenomenon since 2017’s ICO wave.Regulators around the world, particularly conspicuously in the U.S., have repeatedly warned of the need to comply with existing laws, and continue to take action against those actors failing to do so.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Singapore    #Exchanges    #ICO    #USA    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
India Considers Taxing Cryptocurrency at 18% as ‘Intangible Property’: Reports,William Suberg,5/23/2018 20:39,10659,246,"India is working on proposals to make cryptocurrency transactions subject to goods and services tax (GST), sources told Bloomberg May 23.According to the anonymous parties with “direct knowledge” of the plans, the government’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes is considering applying the 18 percent tax to exchange operations, which it would view as “intangible goods.”“Purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies should be considered as supply of goods, and those facilitating transactions like supply, transfer, storage, accounting, among others, will be treated as services,” the publication reports in a summary.India has so far refrained from issuing regulations on cryptocurrency, despite efforts by its central bank to reduce the ability of businesses and citizens to interact with them.In April, the Reserve Bank of India formally forbade domestic institutions from servicing cryptocurrency businesses in a move which has so far failed to curb the proliferation of new exchanges.If the taxation rule goes ahead, it would signal a move towards legitimacy of the industry in the continued absence of hard-and-fast legislation.“If buyers and sellers are in India, the transaction would be treated as a supply of software and the buyer’s location will be the place of supply,” Bloomberg continues, noting elsewhere that:“Transactions beyond the Indian territory will be liable for integrated GST, and would be considered as import or export of goods. IGST will be levied on cross-border supplies.”The move is not the first targeting taxation of cryptocurrency in India. In February, letters were sent to around half a million traders demanding they report profits on exchange activities.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Taxes    #Cryptocurrencies  
US: Crypto Could Pose a Problem for Candidates Seeking Security Clearances,Ana Alexandre,5/23/2018 13:25,14011,230,"The recognition of Bitcoin as a form of foreign currency could potentially have an impact on decisions in recruiting new employees to the US Department of Defence (DoD), Bloomberg reported May 22.The Pentagon’s chief concern is whether investment in cryptocurrencies indicates criminal intent or constitutes an increased predisposition toward risky personal behavior. This could detrimentally affect a job candidate’s profile should the DoD be considering them for a security clearance.For now, the Department of Defense has not produced guidance relating to the ownership of cryptocurrencies. The Pentagon is reportedly waiting for the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other agencies to inform the legislative interpretation of cryptocurrency. The US national security apparatus has to track over 4 mln people with some form of security clearance.As noted by Bloomberg, a more close examination of job applicants who own digital currencies could get in the way of the Pentagon’s efforts to expand its operations in cyberspace. Greg Touhill, who was the first Federal Chief Information Security Officer, said:“If we’re going to say that if you’ve got a Bitcoin or another digital currency account that could be a signal or shoot up a red flag for a security clearance, guess what? Those people aren’t going to sit around waiting to try to onboard for a government job. It would grow the backlog considerably, in my view.”Some experts disagreed over whether owning crypto constitutes a legitimate form of risk. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists said he doubts whether the government, “has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk.” He added that the proxy factors normally maligned by the security apparatus, such as drug use and debt, aren’t necessarily accurate indicators of risk.On the other hand, Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, said the Pentagon is right to scrutinize crypto investors. Weaver repeated the oft-heard argument that, “Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion.” He added:“As for the HODL-ers, they will pass through the clearance process OK because it’s clear they are just little speculators. Or outright delusional speculators, in which case, do you really want that type in government?”Cointelegraph previously reported that San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president John Williams said that cryptocurrency “doesn’t pass the the basic test of what a currency should be.” He stated that a currency should be “basically something with a store of value” and be elastic in order to support varying economic and financial conditions.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #Security  
US: CFTC Seeks to ‘Provide Regulatory Clarity’ for Listing Virtual Currency Derivatives,Molly Jane Zuckerman,5/23/2018 2:25,10704,208,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued an advisory statement for listing virtual currency derivative products, according to a CFTC press release published yesterday, May 21. The advisory statement is aimed at providing clarity for exchanges and clearing houses.The staff advisory, which was jointly issued by the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight (DMO) and Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR), focuses on the specific areas involved in listing virtual currency derivatives on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. It covers the necessity for more market surveillance, coordination with CFTC staff, large trader reporting, and DCO risk management and governance.Amir Zaidi, the director of the DMO, said in the press release that “the CFTC staff is committed to providing regulatory clarity as much as possible,” continuing:“CFTC staff will seek to provide additional guidance to help market participants keep pace with innovation while complying with CFTC regulations.”Marco Santori, President and Chief Legal Officer crypto wallet service Blockchain.com, tweeted a thread of commentary yesterday on the CFTC’s joint statement, pointing out that since the CFTC “keeps discretion as to what threshold constitutes a Large Trader in the crypto context. [It will be] interesting to see where that leads.” Santori’s main takeaway is a comparison of the CFTC’s ability to simply post guidelines for crypto derivatives, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is faced with the more difficult task of deciding whether or not to define tokens and coins as securities:14/ Not only is it harder from a practitioner's standpoint, but it's also far, far more political. It could move a lot of cheese, so to speak. So, while the issues before the CFTC aren't simple, the consequences for getting it wrong are much, much worse on the securities front.Last week, the SEC launched a mock Initial Coin Offering (ICO) website to show investors the warning signs for typical scams and fraud. The SEC and CFTC also held a joint hearing on cryptocurrency in early February. The hearing concluded that the two organizations need to work together on regulating the crypto market, with ICOs needing the most stringent framework, and virtual currencies and digital ledger technologies like blockchain the least.Yesterday, U.S. and Canadian securities regulators announced “Operation Cryptosweep,” a joint series of probes into fraudulent crypto investment programs.",11,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #CFTC    #SEC    #Cryptocurrencies    #ICO    #Canada    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
New Report Calculates Money Lost to Crypto Scams in Australia Last Year,Ana Alexandre,5/22/2018 17:15,9980,183,"Australian consumers lost approximately $2.1 mln to cryptocurrency scams last year, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) annual scams report published May 21.The ACCC’s analysis reveals that the use of digital currencies as a payment method in scams peaked in the last quarter of 2017. Almost $100,000 was reported lost per month to cryptocurrency-based scams from January to September, while in December, reported losses exceeded $700,000. The average reported loss in December had soared to $13,205 from $1,885 in January.Among major means of deceiving users, the Commission highlighted fake initial coin offerings (ICO), pyramid schemes, and ransomware payments:“... instead of people discovering how to directly buy cryptocurrencies, many found themselves caught up in what were essentially pyramid schemes. A number of reports showed that victims entered into cryptocurrency-based scams through friends and family who convinced them they were onto a good thing, a classic element of pyramid schemes.”The ACCC indicated that the figure was influenced by the surging value of cryptocurrencies at the end of the year, saying “as the value of actual cryptocurrencies increased, so too did the scam losses in what people thought were real investments.” Still, the $2.1 mln in total losses was regarded to be conservative, as “with other scams, this is likely the very tip of the iceberg,” the report said.In the beginning of May, Australia’s Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said that it was “taking action” to protect consumers in the ICO space. ASIC was delegated powers to intercede where it judges that an ICO is “misleading” investors, or else engaging in potentially unlicensed conduct, even when the ICO in question “does not involve a financial product.”In March, Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) published statistics on cryptocurrency-related scams in 2017. It said that more than $6.2 mln in digital currency was lost due to fraud and theft, however this figure doesn’t include the over $500 mln hack of NEM from crypto exchange Coincheck in late January.",[],  #Bitcoin Scams    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #ICO    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
US and Canadian Securities Regulators Coordinate ICO Probe in ‘Operation Cryptosweep’,Helen Partz,5/23/2018 13:20,12349,230,"US and Canadian state and provincial securities regulators have opened probes into potentially fraudulent crypto investment programs in what has been dubbed “Operation Cryptosweep”, according to a press release May 21. The latest crackdown on suspicious crypto investment products is reportedly the largest such coordinated investigation by state and provincial officials.Regulators from across 40 jurisdictions coordinated by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) have initiated up to 70 investigations, with more to come in the following weeks. Securities regulators have reportedly warned as many as 35 companies about violations of state securities laws with some cases resulting in cease-and-desist actions.NASAA, which released a warning for Main Street investors regarding the risks associated with crypto and ICOs early this year, said the probe is focusing on suspicious cases of initial coin offerings (ICOs).According to the Washington Post, investigators discovered about 30,000 crypto-related domain names in recent weeks, most of which were registered last year when the Bitcoin (BTC) price reached its all-time-high of around $20,000.Alleged scams have reportedly used fake addresses, flashy marketing materials, and guarantees of up to a 4 percent daily interest rate, while failing to report the potential risks of crypto-investments. Some fraudulent ICOs even used fake celebrity photos to endorse their product.The president of NASAA Joseph Borg stated that regulators do their best to stay one step ahead of potential security violations, noting that not every ICO or cryptocurrency investment is fraudulent.""We’re putting ourselves in the shoes of investors. We’re seeing what’s being promoted to investors. And then we’re taking the next step and then we’re finding out whether they’re complying with securities laws.""Founded in 1919, the NASAA is an association of state and provincial-level securities regulators in the US, Mexico, and Canada. Through the association, state securities regulators can coordinate and take part in “multi-state enforcement actions,” as well as share information.Earlier in May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a fake initial coin offering website to increase awareness of the typical warning signs of scam ICOs and to promote investor education.",5,  #Bitcoin Scams    #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #Fraud    #USA    #Canada    #Security    #SEC

At the meeting, the participants had a chance to receive detailed information on the crypto industry from the leading financial supervisory authority of Europe.In December 2017, Georgia’s NBG took a sceptical stance towards cryptocurrencies, urging citizens to be cautious. The bank told the public that cryptocurrencies do not constitute a legal means of payment, any crypto-related activity is not regulated, and that the NBG bears no responsibility for the subject:“National Bank of Georgia would like to warn citizens on this matter. Cryptocurrencies do not represent means of legal payment in Georgia. Any sort of activity conducted within this sector is not regulated by legislature and therefore is not a sphere of influence of NBG.”Georgia is ranked second in the world after China in the number of known crypto mining facilities, according to Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study issued by Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance in 2017.In April 2016, the Georgian government and leading Bitcoin (BTC) mining hardware manufacturer BitFury launched a project to record land titles on blockchain.

The hearing focused on the SEC’s approach to crypto-related businesses and fundraising through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), local news outlet Siam Blockchain reports.Today’s focus group clarified that ICOs can only raise funds in the Thai baht and cryptocurrencies permitted by the SEC – those that “have enough liquidity and are not associated with money laundering.” Projects running ICOs, whose applications must be completed in 60 days, will also need to adhere to KYC and AML standards.Siam Blockchain also reports that the ICO Portal of Thailand will not list any international ICOs, and that the Thai SEC will not be involved with the ICOs of stable coins, which instead are directed to the national bank for regulation.Last week, the Thai SEC released a crypto regulatory framework that defined cryptocurrencies as “digital assets and digital tokens” under their regulatory jurisdiction. Thai Finance Minister, Apisak Tantivorawong, said that the new legislation is supportive of ICOs, as long as they are officially registered.Cointelegraph reported last week that the new regulations have left some Thai crypto companies confused about how to follow the framework, particularly the sections on registration and taxes, as the new regulations will require that all Thai-based crypto exchanges, brokers, and dealers register with the proper authorities.On May 14, the general secretary of the Thai SEC confirmed with a local news source that additional laws will be introduced to the crypto regulatory framework. Siam Blockchain reports that a Thai SEC hearing on crypto will be held on May 30.In February, the privately owned Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX) announced they were deferring the trading and registration of ICOs for two weeks while waiting for the SEC’s regulatory framework.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Thailand    #SEC    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #KYC    #AML

WSJ: Coinbase Spoke to U.S. Regulators About Acquiring Federal Banking License,Molly Jane Zuckerman,5/22/2018 13:00,29050,473,"Major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange and wallet Coinbase spoke to regulators about obtaining a federal banking charter, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) May 18.Citing “a person familiar with the matter”, the WSJ reports that Coinbase spoke to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) at the beginning of 2018 both about a bank charter and about their business model.A spokesperson for Coinbase declined to comment on the meeting to the WSJ, but added that the company is “committed to working closely with state and federal regulators to ensure we are properly licensed for the products and services we offer.” The OCC and Coinbase have not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment by press time.At the beginning of April, the WSJ reported that Coinbase was also looking into registering as a licensed brokerage firm and electronic-trading venue with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Earlier this week, Coinbase had announced plans to launch a new suite of products targeting institutional investors like hedge funds.As the WSJ points out, a federal banking license would allow Coinbase to offer its own custody and payment services using an OCC limited-purpose charter, also helping the company attract more institutional customers. It would also allow Coinbase to deal with only one federal regulator, as opposed to a multitude of state ones, as well as offer users federally insured bank accounts.However, the OCC’s Joseph Otting said at a banking association meeting in April that most fintech firms that come in with the intention of obtaining a banking charter to avoid state regulations do not follow through:“When they come and they speak to us, and they understand what it really takes to be a bank, they kind of glaze over and often leave skid marks leaving the building.”The U.S. government has recently begun looking more into regulations for cryptocurrencies, with the SEC launching a probe into crypto businesses in the beginning of March. In mid-March, the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment held a hearing on cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with Coinbase’s Chief Legal and Risk Officer Mike Lempres as one of the four industry witnesses.During the hearing Lempres referred to the current US regulatory system for cryptocurrencies as “harming healthy innovation”, due to a lack of clarity.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Coinbase    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Exchanges    #SEC    #ICO    #Federal Reserve    #USA  
South Korea’s Top Financial Watchdog Joins Probe Into Cryptocurrency Exchanges,Helen Partz,5/14/2018 14:20,27126,446,"South Korea’s top financial regulator the Financial Services Commission (FSC) joined the ongoing probe into local cryptocurrency exchanges Sunday, May 13.The FSC will now be taking part in the anti money laundering investigation, hitherto led by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), in order to help expand its scope, news outlet Korea Times reports.Commenting on the agency’s move, Vice Chairman of the FSC Kim Yong-beom has urged regulators worldwide to coordinate their regulatory policies on cryptocurrencies.Following a request from the FSS, the FSC will now check bank accounts belonging to Korean crypto exchanges on compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) standards and other fraud prevention measures. According to Korea Times’ report, the main subject of the expanded audit would be Bithumb, the country’s largest crypto exchange which revealed plans to launch its own crypto token back in April.According to Korea Times, Kim Yong-beom has said that despite the investigation into crypto exchanges, the FSC does not oppose the use of blockchain in banking and financial services and is currently evaluating the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.FSC’s chairman has further noted the need to communicate a coordinated global approach to regulatory policies on crypto, arguing that “international discussion” is “necessary.”“We are seeing a steady development of blockchain technology thanks to its greater accessibility and efficiency. Because this technology has the potential to shake up today's regulations on securities, regulators have to respond to such a looming challenge.”On May 6, the newly appointed FSS governor Yoon Suk-heun took a favourable stance towards crypto, noting its “positive aspects” and claiming that the agency is responsible for providing “remedies to help crypto trading and blockchain technology get better.”Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that South Korean police have started an investigation into Upbit, one of the top crypto exchanges in the country, for alleged fraud.

Zimbabwe’s Central Bank Bans Financial Institutions From All Crypto Dealings,Helen Partz,5/14/2018 13:45,28843,415,"Zimbabwe’s central bank has recently banned dometic financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrencies, local media outlet NewsDay reports today, May 12.According to the report, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s (RBZ)  director and registrar of banking institutions Norman Mataruka issued a circular Friday ordering all financial institutions to terminate servicing cryptocurrency exchanges within 60 days and begin to liquidate existing crypto-related accounts.Financial institutions have been ordered to “ensure that they do not use, trade, hold and/or transact in any way in virtual currencies,” a move which applies to both businesses and individuals.Explaining the decision, Mataruka highlighted the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency and the traditional fiat financial system, stating that the RBZ has an “obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems”, which the central bank is not prepared to provide for crypto.NewsDay reports that the RBZ’s governor John Mangudya warned the public in a separate statement that individuals who trade in cryptocurrency in the country do so “at their own risk”:“Any person who buys, sells, or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online, or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country.”In November 2017, Cointelegraph reported that the RBZ considered the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as payment illegal, until financial authorities develop a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency.In early April, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a similar ban, prohibiting all entities under its jurisdiction from dealing with crypto-related businesses or individuals.RBZ’s move also follows a recent warning against cryptocurrencies from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), which issued a circular last month on the risks associated with crypto trading, such as fraud, hacking, and loss of data.",13,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Zimbabwe    #Central Bank    #Africa    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Government

Crypto Kanoon is a team of Indian lawyers engaged in crypto regulatory analysis and legal awareness.Supreme Court declined to grant interim injunction against RBI banking restriction. Fixed the matter for hearing on 17th May. #bitcoin #RBI https://t.co/bDpQ73cAC911 different representatives from various crypto-related businesses who filed a petition with the Indian Supreme Court sought an interim injunction against the circular. Court documents confirm that the injunction was denied and the case is still pending. The case will be heard again on May 17.An interim injunction is a provisional measure sought during legal proceedings, before trial, requiring a party either to do a specific act, or to refrain from a specific act. They are intended to prevent unjust circumstances pending trial.Last month, the RBI ordered regulated banks and payment platforms to “immediately suspend their services” to companies dealing with digital currencies. The RBI’s statement was met with public outcry as the bank’s move directly affected the interest of a great number of cryptocurrency companies and startups. The circular reads:“… it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by the Reserve Bank shall not deal in VCs [virtual currencies] or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs. Such services include maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/ sale of VCs.”Tech investor Tim Draper warned that the move by RBI could cause a brain drain, in which Indian crypto and blockchain entrepreneurs take their business abroad due to restrictive regulations at home. While Draper approves of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s crackdown on corruption, he called the government's denial of crypto as legal tender “a huge mistake”.In April, a group of cryptocurrency exchanges in Chile appealed to the courts to fight the decision of the country’s banks to close their accounts. The exchanges Buda, Orionx, and CryptoMarket (CryptoMKT), stated that the banking system in Chile was taking matters into their own hands and that they are “killing the entire industry.”On April 25, Buda persuaded the country’s anti-monopoly court to order the re-opening of its accounts at two major Chilean banks. The court published the ruling on its website, ordering state bank Banco del Estado de Chile and Itau Corpbanca to re-open Buda’s accounts while the exchange’s lawsuit continues.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Court    #Banks

Late in April, the director of the Digital Currency Institute at the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) Yao Qian said that the technology warranted “further attention and research” while cautioning on the volatile nature of its current nascent state.To remain competitive internationally, however, blockchain exploration is inevitable for Beijing, according to Yu Kequn, director of the National Center for Information Technology Security Research, who told EID:“The development of blockchain technology may become an important step for China to grasp global technological competition.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Government    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China  
"Local Media: Belarus To Introduce Education, Income Requirements To Invest In ICOs, Crypto",Helen Partz,5/10/2018 13:55,14821,200,"A source close to the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) recently revealed that the bank is considering strict requirements for investing in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Additionally, ? similar regulatory framework is planned for crypto exchanges, local IT media outlet dev.by reports Tuesday, May 8.The regulators proposed limiting ICO investments to qualified investors in order to minimize the risk of common investors losing their money.Qualified investors must fulfill two of four criteria: an individual may become qualified if they have relevant education and work experience. If an individual lacks either of these, they must fulfill one of the financial criteria.According to dev.by, the financial threshold to become a qualified investor is “very high.” Potential investors must have either a $20,000 minimum annual income, or a $50,000 minimum savings. Both sums may include crypto assets and securities, as well as fiat money. According to CEIC data, Belarusian annual household income per capita was $3,478.27 in 2017.Apart from  minimums for annual revenues and accumulated capital, qualified investors must also possess special education and work experience in the relevant field. The report says the same standards will apply to cryptocurrency traders. The source said:“Belarusian crypto exchanges and ICO issuers have no room for error. The investment system in Belarus is at the stage of formation. If any Belarusian ICO project which raised money from the citizens fails, it can become a national scandal. People will lose money. Therefore, at the initial stage of development, we propose to limit ourselves [sic] only to qualified investors.”For ICOs, regulators are planning to set a number of qualifications and reputational requirements, such as an absence of debts on budget payments, risk management policies, internal control policies, and anti-money laundering (AML) policies.Advertising requirements for ICOs are similar to those prescribed for cryptocurrency exchanges: they should not contain promises of guaranteed income, but rather an extended warning on investment risks. The upcoming ICO rules will take “international experience” into account, and would be flexible in order to adapt with dynamic and fast-growing cryptocurrency markets, the source says.Last week, Cointelegraph reported that Belarusian authorities would revise the Decree on the Development of Digital Economy in order to require certain crypto exchanges to provide customer data to authorities.

Khromaev said that, “the point of no return is in the past.”Khromaev suggests that crypto assets and operations should be considered within existing legal frameworks on the basis of the principles behind the asset, and not its form i.e. paper or digital. He added that new regulations should consider the dynamic nature of digital assets.Khromaev says that new rules and regulations for cryptocurrencies will be defined on a national level as “it is still a long way off [for] international standards.”Ukraine has taken an uncertain stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly vis-a-vis Ukraine’s central bank, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). In August 2017, the NBU issued a statement on crypto, claiming that no other currency or substitute currency except the national one can be issued or used as a form of payment in the country. In October, the NBU reported that its High Council of Experts approved proposals to determine the legal status of crypto.In January 2018, the NBU said it was considering launching a digital version of its national currency, the hryvnia.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ukraine    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies

Nijat Imanov of the country’s Taxes Ministry outlined the new measures during the second Finance and Investment Forum (FIF 2018) in Baku Saturday.During the Forum, Imanov stated:“This is formalized as a profit tax for legal entities and income tax for individuals. If someone bought a cryptocurrency and then sold it after its price increased, this amount is recorded as income and therefore should be attracted to taxation.”Trend further reports that the Azerbaijani cryptocurrency market has seen significant growth between May and December 2017, with crypto trading becoming an increasingly popular means of income.Crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat trading, as well as mining, are recognized as taxable events in most countries, falling under either income or profit (known as capital gains) taxation laws. France, for example, has recently brought most cases of crypto trading – excluding mining and ‘industrial level’ trading – under capital gains laws, taxed at a 19 percent flat rate, as opposed to income tax evaluations which can be as high as 45 percent.The American tax authority, the IRS – which treats cryptocurrency as property and the purchase, sale, trade, and mining of crypto as taxable events – recently required major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase to hand over customer data, after concerns that many traders were failing to file tax returns on their gains.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taxes    #Cryptocurrencies    #IRS

Norwegian Crypto Exchange Loses Case Against Nordea Bank For Closing Its Account,Aaron Wood,5/8/2018 13:15,23125,198,"Norwegian cryptocurrency exchange Bitmynt AS has lost its case against Scandinavian financial services giant Nordea, local news E24 reports May 4. The ruling concludes a case, in which Bitmynt founder Sturle Sunde sued Nordea for closing the exchange’s account.Sturle Sunde first brought legal action against Nordea in December of last year, when Nordea closed Bitmynt’s account over concerns of inadequate anti-money laundering mechanisms and terrorist financing risks. According to local news digi.no, this made Sunde ineligible to register with the Brønnøysund Register Centre to establish limited liability. The ruling of the Oslo District Court reads:“The Court is, after a global assessment, [in] no doubt that the risk of money laundering and transactions related to criminal offenses is clearly elevated by Bitcoin trade, although Bitcoin trading is now also largely done [under] legitimate conditions.”The court found “it clear that this risk constitutes an objective reason for the bank to deny customer relationships” under a provision of the Finance Contracts Act. Sunde said he is disappointed in the decision and that the court’s verdict “in practice” bans Bitcoin trading in general in Norway. He maintains that the exchange did not violate any laws, and plans to appeal the decision.The court was especially critical of Sunde’s safety practices, pointing out that they were mostly manually carried out by Sunde himself. The sentence states, “He believes he knows the customer and has a stomach feeling that makes him recognize suspicious conditions.” The court found that Sunde’s intuition, in combination with customer contact and usage of Wallet Explorer, was insufficient in mitigating risk to a degree to which the bank could accept.Sunde said that the financial costs of the case are substantial, having already spent NOK 1 mln ($124,000). He said that he is now considering crowdsourcing for funding the appeal. When asked whether the trial has been worth the money, Sunde answered:“Until now, it has not been, but I hope that it will end.”In April, a group of Chilean cryptocurrency exchanges sued a group of banks for defacto banning the crypto industry in the country by closing down their accounts.

"French Crypto Regulation à la carte: Context, News, Perspectives",Samuel Martinet,5/12/2018 4:00,17885,235,"France has been hard to classify on the crypto lovers/haters spectrum. During the 2018 G20 meetings, it claimed to aim at being a blockchain pioneer. At the same time, its ICO volumes are dwarfed by much smaller neighbors like Switzerland. On April 26, France dramatically cut the taxation of gains on cryptocurrency trading. Let’s see exactly what the French crypto context is, and how we could evaluate it after the recent regulatory changes.State agencies all over the world have several incentives to step up their efforts to regulate the use of blockchain technology. Firstly, it fits their mandate to fight against organized crime by monitoring financial flows. Whether they can succeed in doing so is an open question, but it is certain that this goal alone will keep the state on its toes as long as blockchain exists.Secondly, each national administration tries to encourage business on its territory, and regulation is an essential element of competitiveness. The importance of regulation for a successful blockchain innovation environment can in turn be explained as follows: ensuring a climate of trust helps investment, which itself helps innovation. It can also encourage mainstream users to engage with products associated with a technology that is still in need of legitimacy.2017 and 2018 have seen a rise in regulatory efforts all over the world, particularly in Europe. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) gave a topology for tokens. This classification may well serve as reference for discussions all over Europe, given its clarity and pragmatism. No wonder Switzerland (see Crypto Valley) was able to become one of the world leaders for this industry. Likewise, the Italian Ministry of Economics is working on a decree that will classify the use of cryptocurrencies in the country.On the global crypto map, France illustrated itself with a few successful projects and now has one of the most forward-looking governments in Europe. It triggers the question: what legal framework is there in France?On January 15, 2018, French Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire created a working group, headed by Jean-Pierre Landau, with the purpose of regulating cryptocurrencies. While Landau’s view of what blockchain technology can enable hasn’t been announced explicitly, he is famous for writing an editorial piece for the Financial Times in 2014 titled “Beware the mania for Bitcoin, the tulip of the 21st century.” Does this mean the French are about to bash crypto-innovation?Probably not, as Laurent Leloup, a blockchain expert and initial coin offering (ICO) advisor in Paris commented to Cointelegraph:""The overall legal and business context is very good. Already when he was Minister of the Economy, Emmanuel Macron [the current president of France] launched extensive discussions with the crypto-world in France. What started as the topic of ‘mini-bonds’, continues today with a flurry of parliamentary discussion groups, and consultations between state agencies such as the AMF [the stock market regulatory authority in France] and the private sector.""Likewise, Bruno le Maire seems to have taken a strong pro-blockchain stance at the G20 in Buenos Aires, saying that “France will not miss the blockchain revolution"" and calling for France to take on a pioneering role in the development of blockchain internationally.Nous ne raterons pas la révolution de la #blockchain !#Cryptoactifs, #bitcoin, #ICO, #fintech ... La France veut être force de proposition pour construire le monde de demain ! :fr::rocket:Ma tribune sur @Numerama?#G20Argentina https://t.co/uOG3th2PryIndeed, Gilles Fedak, the computer scientist behind the first large ICO in France, iExec (launched in April 2017), said to Cointelegraph:""The French regulator is technically very knowledgeable, and consistently demonstrated its willingness to dialogue with entrepreneurs from the field.""Looking at the recent past, we can identify a few major steps in the adoption of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in France:France, as well as the United States, base their regulation on the texts and court decisions that apply and interpret the law. Issues associated with blockchain technology fall under two bodies of regulation:Unlike the U.S., where the courts have already dealt with a few blockchain and crypto cases, there is so far no court decision on this matter in France, except for the recent one of the Conseil d’Etat about taxing Bitcoin.Therefore, the blockchain ‘legal framework’ in France, composed of only one specific text and a single decision, is at the moment largely untested.As stated in the introduction, various token classifications have been proposed. These guide the public debate in their respective countries and are as such a crucial factor in the development of a legislative framework around tokens. The AMF, which can be seen as the French version of the FINMA, consulted in late 2017 with a select group of agents from the blockchain industry with two main results.First, a classification/definition of tokens in two categories (compared to three categories for the FINMA) was made:Second, a set of best practices for ICOs was gathered.The French ICO industry is still nascent, with volumes a fraction of what can be observed in Switzerland, the U.S., or Singapore.As mentioned above, there is no specific legal framework for ICOs in France. In practice, this leads banks and accounting firms – the first interlocutor of any business – to be very wary of engaging in anything crypto-related. The AMF, however, has announced a set of guidelines for ICOs.Beyond the token classification, there are some proposals about information that must be provided in a white paper. Namely, any white paper should include:In the near future, ICOs that abide by these rules as well as other ‘best practices’ – yet to be legally defined – could submit their white paper to obtain a ‘visa’ that would be delivered by the AMF (or one of its affiliates). William O'Rorke, legal advisor at Blockchain Partner, explains:""France is about to introduce a completely novel framework for ICOs: a voluntary visa system that incorporates much of the 'best practices' advocated for by the French crypto-industry. ICOs that comply with these best practices will thus be able to apply for official approval by the regulator. In effect, this visa will split the ICO market between AMF (of some affiliate) approved ICOs and unregulated ICOs.""The importance of this visa cannot be understated. Echoing the difficulties of the entrepreneurs interviewed by Cointelegraph, William O'Rorke describes:""As of today, simple things like opening a bank account can prove difficult for crypto-projects.""The visa system could enable legitimate ICOs to more easily interact with critical third parties such as banks and accounting firms. It is also interesting to remark how innovative this voluntary approach is internationally.  Laurent Leloup shares:""France's visa approach will for instance be in contrast with the 'sandbox system' in place in Switzerland.""However, not everyone is fully satisfied with the visa approach. According to Adli Takkal Bataille, president of the French association Le Cercle du Coin (‘Circle of the Coin’) :""In a way, the concept of ‘utilities’ has enabled the regulator to pretend that ‘everything is fine’ and gave it an excuse not to act, even though the risks can be high for investors. As opposed to this, in the United States, the regulators’ default approach has been to treat tokens as ‘securities’, putting investors’ protection first.""The future will say what solution to the trade-off between investor protection and lightly regulated innovation was best. Surprisingly for France, it seems like the latter has for once been given priority.The majority of French people think there is a ‘legal vacuum’ concerning the taxation of Bitcoin in France, which is not true. The  Bulletin officiel des impôts (Official Tax Bulletin), a periodical written and edited by the General Direction of Public Finance (French tax authority), in 2014 issued clear rules concerning the taxation of cryptocurrencies:The April 26 decision of the Conseil d’État clarified the specifics of Bitcoin taxation in France. To schematize, the occasional gains are now considered:The direct effect is that France moves from a progressive taxation (between 14 and 45 percent) to a fixed taxation of 19 percent. This decision refers only to Bitcoin, but in spirit – and in practice – this text will be applied to any other coin.Adli Takkal Bataille, looking at where France stands at an international level, is careful to bring competing jurisdictions into the equation:“While the last amendments to the tax systems are good for small investors, they are as restrictive as ever for larger players. The risk is that this creates an exodus to countries that are fiscally more attractive. A real solution would eventually have to be crafted at the European level.”The 2014 guidance, like most of the legislation so far, mostly focuses on the taxation of individuals. The tax treatment of ICOs, on the other hand, is still unclear. Gilles Fedak thus remarks:""The visa system is expected to provide guidelines for how to make ICOs: for instance, what must figure in white papers. This is critical, but it will not, by itself, clarify how crypto-assets should be treated from an accounting point of view. So even after the ‘visa system’, the way accountants should treat the crypto-assets resulting from an ICO will still be unclear. On the other hand, the taxation of crypto-trading started to become clearer with the recent decision of the Conseil d’État.""The accounting rules for crypto-assets on companies’ balance sheets are a major question mark. This generates a lot of uncertainty because accounting treatment determines taxation. When will this be clarified? No earlier than the end of the year, according to William O'Rorke:""One crucial element for the industry is the clarification of accounting rules regarding crypto-assets. This, in turns, will guide their taxation. We expect this clarification to fall within the scope of the oncoming tax reform, which is announced for the end of 2018.""    Yet, promising blockchain projects in France are multiplying by the day, hand in hand with the development of an entire ecosystem of financiers, research groups, and tech incubators.The French legislators are not only supportive for blockchain entrepreneurs, but also quite knowledgeable of the underlying technology. This places France in a good position for more leadership in the crypto industry going forward.So far, legislators have mostly worked on establishing a legal framework for trading and transferring crypto currencies. On the other hand, accounting rules for the treatment of crypto assets, especially in the context of ICOs, still have to be defined. What comes next?

According to the website, the token can buy telemedical coverage “through an artificial intelligence chat service that creates medical solutions through use of blockchain technology.”According to DORA, Linda Healthcare offers no warnings that ICOs constitute a security in the state of Colorado. “The Linda Health Insurance network is, to date, not in operation,” officials reported.

Officials say that the “math-oriented value system” on the website was not operational.DORA representatives reported that both companies did not provide any information on the risks of investing in crypto or ICOs on their websites. Colorado Securities Commissioner Gerald Rome commented that investments in ICO tokens should be done carefully: “Investment opportunities being sold through ICOs over the internet need to be approached with the same level of caution as for any highly risky investment venture.”The firms must now prove why the should not be sanctioned under the Colorado Securities Act, according to which the firms will receive cease and desist orders.Earlier in March, the Massachusetts Securities ?Division issued consent orders requiring the permanent suspension of five firms’ unregistered ICO sales, citing that the companies were selling unregistered securities.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tokens    #Investments  
US: Arizona’s Cryptocurrency Tax Bill Sees Rollback On Crypto Acceptance,Ana Alexandre,5/4/2018 11:30,24367,201,"The Arizona House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 1091, a tax bill that would allow citizens to pay their taxes using cryptocurrencies, according to public records May 2. Following the recent vote however, this initiative has been stymied with amendments.The mandate targeted at the Department of Revenue of Arizona would have opened the door to accepting digital currency as a payment method for taxes.The bill, which passed the Arizona State Senate on Feb. 8, would allow residents of Arizona to pay their state taxes with digital currency. The state government would then convert the digital currency payments to US dollars within 24 hours of their receipt.Rather than openly allowing the receipt of digital currencies for taxes, the House revision merely compels the Department of Revenue to consider the possibility of alternative forms of payment. The amended bill states:“The department shall study whether a taxpayer may pay the taxpayer's income tax liability by using a payment gateway, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or any other cryptocurrency that uses electronic peer?to-peer systems. The department shall study the conversion of cryptocurrency payments to United States dollars at the prevailing rate after receipt and shall study the process of crediting the taxpayer's account with the converted dollar amount actually received less any fees or costs incurred by the department for conversion.”The language provided in the amendment does not define when such a study would begin, or the length of time it would take for the Department to make a determination. Moving forward, legislators from both the state Senate and House will negotiate the terms of the bill.Several states in the country have considered and passed legislation regarding cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Wyoming passed a group of bills that, among other measures, created a new asset class for crypto in the state. Georgia and Illinois are also considering legislation that would accept cryptocurrency for taxes and license fees.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Government    #Taxes    #Cryptocurrencies    #Payments  
China National Radio Alleges OKEx Illegally Trading Crypto Futures In China,Molly Jane Zuckerman,5/4/2018 13:15,18061,218,"China National Radio’s (CNR) “Voice of China” program has alleged that the crypto exchange OKEx is illegally working in China with Chinese clients, CNR reports Thursday, May 3. Chinese crypto exchanges have been banned from operating in the country by the government last fall.As of press time, OKEx is the third ranked exchange by 24 hour trading volume on Coinmarketcap, with around $1.8 bln reported in trades over the past 24 hours.The Voice of China report is part of a series that aims to “reveal the secret behind digital currencies.” The article quotes reported OKEx investor Yang, who believes that OKEx still operates the company in Beijing for Chinese users. He alleges that the exchange has moved its headquarters to Belize and the team to Hong Kong in name only.Yang says that OKEx is actually conducting crypto future transactions that use leverage to multiply trade results, even though OKEx calls them “contract transactions.” The Voice of China report also notes that OKEx has a “point to point” transaction that lets consumers pay with their Alipay or Wechat accounts, despite China’s ban on transacting between crypto and fiat.Voice of China adds that Yang and other OKEx investors reported the crypto exchange to the public security, industry and commerce departments, but were told that the Financial Bureau was handling it.OKEx had not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment by press time.In February of this year, China blocked foreign crypto exchanges on top of the domestic exchange ban, citing “financial risks.” However, Cointelegraph reported in March that despite China’s crypto crackdown, crypto and blockchain development are still growing in the country.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #CoinMarketCap    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
"Bloomberg: Crypto Not Really Comparable To Traditional Asset Classes, Future Uncertain",Molly Jane Zuckerman,5/4/2018 5:10,14980,156,"Bloomberg has detailed the course of cryptocurrency’s volatility, trading activity, and correlation with other assets over a period of 16 months. In an article published Wednesday, May 2, they conclude that crypto’s past performances are no guarantee of future ones.Bloomberg begins by noting that Bitcoin (BTC) - and cryptocurrencies in general - have such an extreme volatility that they are not currently useful for payment in stores or salaries. The article notes that the only non-crypto related investments that have shown similar volatility to crypto in this 16 month time period are a South African company facing an accounting scandal, and a Russian bank that received “Russia’s biggest-ever financial bailout.”Reflecting on Bitcoin’s dominance, its trading volume and market capitalization share are both exponentially higher than any other cryptocurrencies’, as opposed to traditionally traded stocks with their relatively even distribution. Bloomberg cites LDJ Capital Founder David Drake as noting this means that trading in the smaller cryptocurrencies should be considered similar to early-stage VC investing.Bloomberg also charts how related cryptocurrencies are to traditional assets classes, concluding that the relationship, if any, is currently weak. Cryptocurrencies do tend to move with each other with the exception of the dollar-backed Tether, Bloomberg points out. As a final point, Bloomberg brings up the fact that the high returns possible through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) may be stunted due to increasing government scrutiny, like the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) cryptocurrency probe reported in March. As the future is uncertain, according to Bloomberg, “investors should tread carefully.” Yesterday, the traditional banking giant Goldman Sachs said that they would be opening up a crypto trading desk after the bank had been “inundated” with client requests for the service.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Markets    #SEC    #ICO  
South Korean Lawmakers Introduce Bill To Legalize New ICOs,Ana Alexandre,5/7/2018 14:45,25421,461,"A group of South Korean lawmakers is working on a bill to legalize the launch of new initial coin offerings (ICOs) and digital currencies, local news outlet The Korea Times reported May 2.Rep. Hong Eui-rak of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea is leading the move along with 10 other legislators to back the bill and have it endorsed this year.During his speech at a forum devoted to ICOs and blockchain technology at the National Assembly on Wednesday, Hong said that ""the bill is aimed at legalizing ICOs under the government's supervision."" He also said that the bill was based on collaborative research conducted by his office and the Korea International Trade Association (KITA). Hong added:""The primary goal (of the legislation) is helping remove uncertainties facing blockchain-related businesses.""According to the bill, ICOs initiated by public organizations and research centers will be subject to strict supervision by the Financial Services Commission and the Ministry of Science and ICT.Chung Sye-kyun, a speaker from the National Assembly, underlined the role of lawmakers to eliminate political uncertainties surrounding digital currencies and blockchain technology:""Blockchain and cryptos can be used in various public sectors for good causes. Given their potential, we need to work to help reduce political uncertainties they face.""The move is the first parliamentary challenge to the government's ban on the opening of new ICOs, which was introduced late last year to fight speculative investments in cryptocurrencies.In March, 2018 rumors surfaced that certain entities within the South Korean government were considering to release the ban on ICOs, so long as new offerings adhered to strict government standards.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Tradings  
Barclays’ CEO Refutes Rumors The Bank Is Opening Crypto Trading Desk,Marie Huillet,5/2/2018 11:27,12682,211,"Barclays’ CEO Jes Staley has refuted recent rumours that the UK bank will be opening a cryptocurrency trading desk, UK media platform Financial News reported May 1. During the bank’s annual general meeting, Staley cited potential compliance and regulatory barriers, saying:“Cryptocurrency is a real challenge for us because, on the one hand, there is the innovative side of it and wanting to stay in the forefront of technology’s improvement in finance… On the other side of it, there is the possibility of cryptocurrencies being used for activities that the bank wants to have no part of.”As Cointelegraph reported in mid-April, Barclays had reportedly conducted a preliminary assessment to gage whether client interest was sufficient to warrant setting up a dedicated desk. Staley did however say yesterday that the bank continues to help its clients to settle Bitcoin futures contracts that are being offered on derivatives exchanges such as CME Group Inc. and CBOE Global Markets Inc.Staley’s rebuttal echoes that of Goldman Sachs’ CEO Lloyd Blankfein in January, who put an end to similar speculations that the New York bank would set up its own cryptocurrency trading desk. Goldman Sachs has - reportedly “inadvertently” - owned a stake in a Circle-owned crypto trading desk since 2015.Within the last two weeks, Goldman Sachs has responded to “client interest,” choosing to hire a cryptocurrency trader as vice president of digital asset markets of their securities division.Staley’s wary stance echoes an in-house analysis that was issued by Barclays Plc in April, which likened the spread of Bitcoin investment to an infectious disease. The Barclays analysts claimed that “immunity threshold” among new investors has now been reached, and considered that the crypto virus is more than likely to go into “remission.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Barclays    #Banks    #Tradings  
CryptoUK Trade Association Calls On MPs To Regulate Cryptocurrency Sector In UK,Ana Alexandre,5/2/2018 0:02,11363,263,"CryptoUK, a self-regulatory trade association for the UK cryptocurrency industry, addressed several Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for favorable regulations in the sector, news outlet City A.M. reported May 1.The association set out its proposals in writing to the Treasury Select Committee's inquiry into cryptocurrencies today. The inquiry intends to examine the role of digital currencies in the UK, including risks connected to their usage by consumers, businesses, and the government.While regulators around the world have claimed that cryptocurrencies are instruments for criminal activity, CryptoUK said that regulation should concentrate on brokers and trading platforms rather than digital currencies themselves.The group reportedly believes that HM Treasury should provide the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with new permissions to control cryptocurrency investment. In addition, CryptoUK proposed that the FCA be responsible for the licensing of approved exchanges and enforcing new requirements. This would include anti-money laundering practices, examination of investors, and operational standards. Iqbal Gandham, the chair of CryptoUK and UK managing director at eToro, said:“Introducing a requirement for the FCA to regulate the 'on-off' ramps between crypto and fiat currencies is well within the remit of HM Treasury. Based on our analysis, this could be achieved relatively easily, without the need for primary legislation, and would have a huge impact, both in reducing consumer risk and improving industry standards.”Gandham continued, introducing examples of other countries where the governing approach has worked well and outlining the importance of taking a proactive stance in the UK:“This is an approach which is already working well in other countries, who are now taking the lead over the UK, for example in Japan and Gibraltar. This is a wonderful opportunity for government to take a proactive stance, putting action where there are positive words and reinforcing the UK’s role as the world’s financial capital.""CryptoUK was formed in February this year when seven of the largest cryptocurrency companies globally joined forces, aiming to self-regulate within the UK crypto industry.

IMF Report Says Crypto Does Not ‘Pose Risks’ To Global Finance,William Suberg,5/1/2018 21:51,21703,419,"Cryptocurrencies “do not appear to pose risks to financial stability,” the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a report published the second week of April.In comments on crypto assets as part of its Global Financial Stability Report, the organization continued its recent stance in promoting international agreements on regulation. The report continues, “...they could [pose a risk] should their use become more widespread without the appropriate safeguards.”The tone is bullish against the titular theme of “a bumpy road ahead” for world finance, and does not discount the potential for cryptocurrency to “transform financial activity.” The report states:“It is impossible to know the extent to which crypto assets may transform the financial infrastructure and whether most new crypto assets are likely to disappear as in past episodes of technological innovation (as many tech companies did during the boom of the late 1990s, for example). Before they can transform financial activity in a meaningful and lasting manner, crypto assets will first need to earn the confidence and support of consumers and financial authorities.”The report adds that, in order to gain this confidence, there will need to be a consensus among the global regulatory community about what crypto assets are; a security or a currency.The IMF thus follows in the footsteps of other financial institutions this year, notably the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The head of the FSB, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, told the G20 in March that crypto assets “do not pose risks” to the world’s economy.Meanwhile, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has similarly adopted a weighted stance on crypto, acknowledging its “benefits” while simultaneously warning about illicit uses which require attention. “A judicious look at crypto-assets should lead us to neither crypto-condemnation nor crypto-euphoria,” she wrote in an official blog post last month.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Finance    #Cryptocurrencies    #IMF  
Hong Kong Gov’t Report Says Bitcoin Poses ‘Medium-Low’ Risk In Financial Crime,Molly Jane Zuckerman,5/25/2018 7:25,39487,432,"The Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury (FSTB) released a report yesterday, April 30, on the status of money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF). The report concluded that virtual currencies (VC), like Bitcoin (BTC), are not particularly involved in either type of financial crime.The FSTB notes that “although there is inherent ML/TF vulnerability related to VCs”:“There does not seem to be any visible impact affecting the overall risk in Hong Kong so far. The risk of VCs is assessed as medium-low.”The report does mention the use of cryptocurrencies in Ponzi schemes and cybercrimes – specifically mentioning the WannaCry attack – citing 167 Bitcoin (BTC) related police reports from 2013-2017.The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment Report also mentions that the FSTB, Hong Kong financial regulators, and law enforcement agencies are working together to look into risks associated with Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and cryptocurrencies in general as well:“While we have not found substantial risks in these newly developing payment methods or commodities, this is a rapidly developing area requiring continued monitoring.”According to the report, cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in Hong Kong. The FTSB suggests that because Hong Kong “is one of the world’s freest economies with a vibrant foreign currency exchange market and no capital controls [...] VCs are therefore not as attractive as in economies where people may try to circumvent currency controls or seek refuge from a high inflation rate”:“The exchange of Bitcoin in person is not popular [...] Domestically, the use of Bitcoin remains at a negligible level.”The report writes that the Bitcoin ATMs in Hong Kong are also “not popularly used by people in Hong Kong.”As a comparison, in Venezuela – a country whose economy is currently experiencing hyperinflation – many citizens have begun to rely on Bitcoin as a more stable store of value as compared to their national currency.In February of this year, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) warned potential crypto investors that they would keep “policing” cryptocurrency and ICO markets. In mid-March, the SFC halted an ICO in Hong Kong and made the company return the money raised, on the grounds that it was an unregistered investment scheme. More recently, in mid-April, the SFC said that the type of fundraising done through ICOs is better suited to venture capital funds.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Hong Kong    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #AML  
CFTC Chairman On Crypto Regulation: ‘I Don’t See It Being Resolved Anytime Soon’,Ana Alexandre,5/1/2018 5:26,18418,195,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Chris Giancarlo said he doesn’t see comprehensive crypto legislation coming from the federal level in the near future, CNBC reports April 30.In an interview on Monday, Giancarlo pointed out that the statutes by which the CFTC is operating were written in 1935. He said that embracing a modern innovation like Bitcoin within terms invented decades ago will take time:“The statutes we are operating, you know, were written... in 1935 … And it’s often hard to look at those statutes and find out where something as new and innovative as Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, where do they fall into a regulatory regime which was written decades ago... we see elements of commodities that are subject to our regulation, but depending on which regulatory regime you are looking at, it has different aspects of all of that.”He noted that two major US exchanges, CBOE and CME, are successfully operating Bitcoin futures contracts. Giancarlo said that the complicated nature of Bitcoin itself makes it difficult to regulate:“...Bitcoin and a lot of other virtual currency counterparts really have elements of all of the different asset classes whether a medium of payment, whether a long-term asset, and so as regulators we’ve come to grips with this just now in real time and it’s complicated. And I don’t see it being resolved any time soon.”Giancarlo stressed that the main role of a regulator is to watch that everyone on the market acts according with the laws set by Congress. He said that one might see “in this Congress or in a future Congress, an attempt to deal with this new innovation.” When asked whether he believed Congress was capable of resolving the regulatory dissonance in the crypto sphere, he answered:“...There’s certainly an appetite among a number of Congressmen and [Congresswomen] and Senators that I’ve spoken to, to approach this with some new eyes, some new thinking and so I think there’s a growing chorus on Capitol Hill for some re-thinking here.”Earlier today, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Robert Jackson called the initial coin offerings (ICO) market a prime example of an unregulated securities market vis-a-vis the issue of consumer protection in ICOs.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #CFTC    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA  
"US: ICO Market Is Example Of Unregulated Securities Market, Says SEC Commissioner",Molly Jane Zuckerman,5/25/2018 6:10,14123,226,"US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Robert Jackson highlighted consumer protection regarding Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in an interview on CNBC today, April 30.When asked about cryptocurrencies and ICOs, Jackson said that he hasn’t yet seen an ICO that wasn’t a security, echoing SEC chairman Jay Clayton’s comments earlier this year. Jackson added that the crypto space “has been full of troubling developments that we’ve seen at the SEC, and especially the ICO space,” adding:“Investors are having a hard time telling the difference between investments and fraud.”The ICO market right now, according to Jackson, is a prime example of an unregulated securities market:“If you want to know what our markets would look like with no securities regulation, what it would look like if the SEC didn’t do its job? The answer is the ICO market.”However, Jackson doesn’t think this means either more bans or regulation, but rather a focus “on protecting investors who are getting hurt in this market” for right now. He suggested in the future looking into “ways to make those investments work consistent with our securities law.”At the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) cryptocurrency hearing in February of this year, the conclusion was reached that digital ledger technologies (DLT) like blockchain need the least regulation, ICOs need the most, and virtual currencies fall somewhere in between.More recently, during a hearing at the US House of Representatives on April 28, the director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said that the SEC was striving for a “balanced approach” in regards to ICO regulation.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #USA    #ICO    #CFTC    #Markets  
"Japanese Regulators Discussed Restricting Trade Of Privacy-Focused Altcoins, Report Says",William Suberg,4/30/2018 12:59,17474,384,"Japanese regulators suggested preventing cryptocurrency exchanges from trading anonymity-oriented altcoins Dash (DASH) and Monero (XMR) this month, Forbes reports today, April 30.Relating the outcome of a working group meeting of industry “experts” and the country’s regulator the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the publication quotes one member of the group raising the idea of preventative measures regarding the altcoins, which are known for their focus on privacy and user anonymity.“It should be seriously discussed as to whether any registered cryptocurrency exchange should be allowed to use such currencies,” the unnamed member said, according to Forbes.In light of Japanese exchange Coincheck’s $530 mln hack in January of this year, the FSA has scrambled to ensure a repeat performance does not befall Japan’s crypto sector.In mid-March of this year, Coincheck dropped Monero, Dash and ZCash trading in March, while the FSA issued penalties to other exchanges which have failed to comply with requirements as part of the country’s exchange licensing scheme.While official plans for the coins have not surfaced from the FSA, exchanges looking to stay on the right side of the regulators should soon receive sanctioned assistance from Japan’s new self-regulatory body which came into being last week.The Nihon Kasotsuka Kokangyo Kyokai (Japan Cryptocurrency Exchange Association) will aim to bring about best practices in the sector, Cointelegraph reported April 26, while chairman Taizen Okuyama previously expressed a wish to “create a situation where he can give advice to” unlicensed platforms.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Dash    #Monero    #Exchanges    #Government  
Morgan Stanley Research: Defined Regulations Main Factor For Crypto Exchanges When Choosing Country,Andrew Marshall,4/29/2018 21:28,25035,468,"Thanks to its well-defined regulatory framework, Malta now accounts for the largest share of cryptocurrency trading volume in the world. This conclusion comes from a Business Insider report Sunday, Apr 29, that cites a recent research done by the Morgan Stanley bank.A team of Morgan Stanley researchers, led by analyst Sheena Shah, has conducted a study on the distribution of cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto trading volume across all countries, based on volume data from Coinmarketcap and company registration info listed on the websites of the respective exchanges.The top five countries by crypto trade volume are, in order, Malta, Belize, Seychelles, the US and South Korea, whereas the countries that are home to the largest number of exchanges are the UK, Hong Kong, USA, Singapore and Turkey.One of the study’s primary discoveries was a discrepancy evident in the data from Malta and Belize - the two countries are the first and second in the world by trade volume but only 22nd and 24th by the number of registered companies respectively.According to the researchers, this seeming contradiction is explained by the fact that these relatively small countries actually host the two largest exchanges by trading volume. Binance moved from Hong Kong to Malta after promising to do so in March of this year and OKEx, currently the second biggest exchange as per Coinmarketcap data, is officially registered in Belize. Shah commented:""The largest exchange called Binance announced intentions to set up headquarters there, so if we take that company out, Malta would be much further down the list.""Among other notable finds made by Morgan Stanley’s team is the fact that the United Kingdom, despite being the country that currently hosts the largest number of exchanges, only accounts for one percent of the global trading volume.Overall, Shah concluded that the favorableness of local crypto business regulations is one of the main factors taken into account by crypto exchanges when deciding what country to register in. She added that in order to be attractive, a particular regulatory framework doesn’t necessarily have to be lenient but rather well-defined, because that means that the exchanges “know what to expect” and can “plan for the future.”""Defined but also attractive regulation makes an exchange decide to choose one country over another - a set of laws for companies to follow when handling digital tokens, customer assets, AML policies, taxes, etc. Regulatory certainty is part of the attractiveness for the companies so they can plan for the future as they know what to expect. Low taxes are a benefit.""This assumption is in line with the experience of Malta, whose government has recently announced that it is adopting a favorable stance towards cryptocurrency businesses. Morgan Stanley’s research has provided apparent evidence that Malta’s active development of a thought-out legal framework is now bearing expected fruit.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Malta    #CoinMarketCap  
"US: SEC Official Says ICO Regulation Should Be ‘Balanced’, Congressman Suggests Ban",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/28/2018 13:05,23131,289,"In a hearing at the US House of Representatives on Thursday, April 26, a regulator from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and House Financial Services Committee members hotly disagreed over whether a “balanced approach” could be taken in regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).At the start of the hearing, entitled “Oversight of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance”, William Hinman, the director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, said that the area of digital assets and ICOs “continues to evolve”:“We are striving for a balanced approach, and one that ensures capital formation while maintaining a strong focus on investor protection.”One purpose of the hearing was to discuss possible reasons for the declining number of Initial Public Offerings (IPO) in the country. Committee member Bill Huizenga asked Hinman if ICOs could be a solution to this decline, and whether all ICOs must be regulated.In response, Hinman said that “in theory, there is a time when a coin may achieve a decentralized utility in the marketplace, or [...] there may be coins where that lack of a central actor may make it difficult to regulate.”Hinman followed previous comments from SEC chairman Jay Clayton that most ICOs should  be considered securities. According to Hinman, the SEC would be consulting with entities releasing tokens to verify that the offerings were either regulated or not qualified as securities.Committee member Brad Sherman (D-CA) disagreed with the idea that ICOs could replace IPOs, as an IPO “provides jobs in the real economy,” and ICOs do “the opposite”:“It takes money out of the real economy, it takes people willing to invest and risk, and says ‘don’t use that ability to risk, don’t use those animal spirits to help create a job for a person who needs one, let alone build a factory for thousands, sit there and trade back and forth in the ICO.’”Sherman then asked why ICOs haven’t been “stopped,” noting that the “balance” mentioned by Hinman will negatively affect the economy:“When you strike a balance between those who are trying to create a new currency to facilitate drugs, tax evasion, to deprive the Fed of its ability to market our securities and return 100 bln dollars or so to the US treasury, all the balances are for total investor protection, which could be achieved by totally banning.”Sherman said of the decentralized nature of ICOs:“Charlatans and scammers have always favored decentralized new enterprises.”Committee member Tom Emmer (R-MN) took a different approach, saying that there “is a lot of of ignorance about how special this area is”, he continued:“The typical attitude too that I get from so many elected officials is that have no idea what they are talking about [...] everyone who is participating in [an area they don’t know] is either bad or dishonest, and an official must rush in and help people .”The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) held a cryptocurrency hearing in February of this year. They reached the conclusion that ICOs need the most amount of oversight, digital ledger technologies (DLT) like Blockchain the least, with virtual currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) falling somewhere in between.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #USA    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government

The MOU establishes funding for educational programs related to fintech and blockchain startups.Burt signed the MOU with Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of the world’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange by market capitalization. Burt said that Binance’s goals “align with [their] aims and objectives to provide a leading well-regulated jurisdiction ideally suited to the growth of the fintech industry.”Burt stated that Binance plans to develop a “global compliance base” in Bermuda, a move which Burt says will add around 40 news jobs, at least 30 of which will go to Bermudians.According to the MOU, Binance will spend up to $10 mln on university level training for Bermudians in blockchain technology development and compliance through the Binance Foundation. The company will also provide up to $5 mln in investments in new Bermuda-based blockchain companies through Binance Labs.The Bermuda government reportedly plans to develop a friendly legal framework for virtual currencies and blockchain. Zhao said that research conducted by Binance shows that Bermuda has “one of the leading regulatory bodies” for virtual currency:“We think the Bermuda Government and regulatory body are one of the most approachable, most reasonable and most forward-thinking bodies on the planet.”According to Zhao, the exchange has already started working with local solicitors in order to ensure that the new office will be compliant with the law.Burt said that the government wants to make Bermuda “the first country in the world” to “comprehensively govern” initial coin offerings (ICO) within the country’s jurisdiction.""We want to ensure that Bermuda is the world's number-one place for regulation inside of this space. We have a reputation to protect,  we will protect it, but at this point in time we will work with all persons who we believe represent future growth for the people of this country and future opportunities and jobs.""Earlier this week, Binance partnered with Ugandan blockchain organization Crypto Savannah to support economic development and youth employment in the country.

These methods help to control risks and correct mistakes. For regular code upgrades, controllable intelligent contract replacement is achieved by separating code and data, and combining multi-layer smart contract structures.”Qian references the DAO hack of 2016, when around $60 mln in Ethereum (ETH) was stolen, as highlighting how when problems arise, they “cannot be repaired by shutting down the system and centralizing upgrades as a centralized system does.” The lack of centralized governance mechanisms also means that “problems can only be resolved through soft forks or hard forks, which will eventually lead to confusion and division.”In the future, Qian sees “various blockchain systems hav[ing] different levels of decentralization to meet the specific needs of different scenarios.”Solutions to the problems that Qian has identified in the current state of Blockchain technology are a potential addition of the verification methods used by military control systems or chip design, as well as “avoid[ing] human errors as much as possible through mathematical proof.”Qian concludes by writing that “the blockchain belongs to the public and serves the public interest”:“The blockchain should not be owned by anyone, let alone a small fraction of the super-rich. Therefore, some people are opposed to the governance of the chain.Overall, the governance mechanism on the chain is still in the process of controversy and exploration. There is not yet a unified opinion and we need further attention and research.”Cointelegraph recently reported that the election of a pro-market economist to head the PBoC could have a positive impact on the Chinese cryptocurrency sector. Qian also notes that Chinese president Xi Jinping recently spoke of the need for China to focus on tech development:“We must resolve to maintain our perseverance, identify the focus, and accelerate the promotion of core technologies in the field of information.”In early March, the now-former head of the PBoC said that Blockchain technology should not “spread too rapidly” in order to prevent a negative effect on financial stability. The new governor, Yi Gang, who was appointed in mid-March, is reported to have spoken positively of Bitcoin, calling it “inspiring” and stating that it gives “ordinary people [the] freedom to participate.”The debate over whether Blockchain and Bitcoin as entities must always go together was raised earlier this month by the CEO of Lightning Labs, who challenged the “Blockchain over Bitcoin” narrative. The separation of the two concepts has been practiced by central banks like the Reserve Bank of India, which promotes Blockchain innovation while saying that cryptocurrencies can destabilize the traditional financial system.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #PBoC    #China    #Bitcoin News    #Ethereum News    #DAO  
“With Revolution Comes Risk”: Australia’s Securities Regulator Updates ICO And Crypto Guidelines,Marie Huillet,4/27/2018 16:32,22424,215,"Australia’s Securities and Investments (ASIC) Commissioner John Price delivered a speech in which he highlighted the financial regulator’s updated guidelines for ICO and cryptocurrencies, at a Fintech event in Sydney April 26:“The development of innovative technologies like blockchain and ICOs has the potential to revolutionize how our society engages with financial products and services, but with revolution comes risk… Scams are corrosive when it comes to building any form of trust, and we all have a role to play in making sure they don’t happen.”Price’s speech focused on protecting Australian consumers, highlighting that Australian corporate and consumer laws apply even if an ICO is created and operated from overseas.Last year ASIC released an information sheet providing guidance for any entity considering an ICO, potentially bringing them under Australia’s 2001 Corporations Act, depending on the type of token being offered. ICOs can be considered “managed investment schemes,” shares or derivatives offerings, or “non-cash payment facilities,” and Price also emphasized yesterday their “basic obligation not to mislead or deceive through any offers or marketing.”Price said that it was in the crypto industry’s “interests to build a more mature sector that can sustain longer term public confidence,” adding that ASIC is currently collaborating with other domestic and international regulators to clarify a framework for cryptocurrencies “across taxation, anti-money laundering, payment systems and financial services.”ASIC, as per Price, maintains an “open mind when it comes to new technologies and ‘early-days’ business models,” deeming that the “right regulatory environment” will allow fintech innovation to “flourish.”Across Europe, Asia, and the US, there has been considerable regulatory momentum pertaining to the crypto sphere. ICOs are coming under particular scrutiny, as well as the need to leverage Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) measures and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance across the industry. The uncertain impact of the advent of regulation is already having an effect on incoming capital, yet some investors believe regulatory clarity will prove positive in the long haul.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #ICO    #Bitcoin News  
"France: Crypto Is Now ‘Moveable Property’, Tax Down From 45 To 19 Percent",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/27/2018 14:28,36402,1109,"France’s Conseil d’Etat (Council of State) has changed the tax rate on cryptocurrency sales to a flat rate of 19 percent, rather than up to 45 percent like before, local news outlet, Le Monde reported Thursday, April 26.The Council of State said that the tax change comes from a new classification of Bitcoin (BTC) separate from commercial or non-commercial activity:“The sale of ‘bitcoins’ [fell under] the principle from the category of capital gains of movable property.”The exceptions to the flat rate are earnings from crypto mining, which will be taxed as non-commercial profits, and income as a result of professional activity, which will be taxed as industrial and commercial profits.Le Monde noted that the decision to change the crypto tax rate came after citizens appealed to France’s highest regulatory body earlier this year to change the regulations for crypto transactions that had been in place since July 2014.France has been working on their cryptocurrency regulations this year. At the beginning of the year, the Minister of Economy created a crypto task force to examine regulation, and in March, the government proposed a ban on investment companies to trade in crypto until regulations have been implemented.Also in March, France’s financial market regulator was reported to be looking into legislation that would encourage the development of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #France    #Taxes    #Cryptocurrencies  
Japanese Crypto Exchange Everybody’s Bitcoin Receives Citation From Financial Regulators,Ana Alexandre,4/27/2018 4:47,23977,266,"Tokyo-based virtual currency exchange Everybody’s Bitcoin Co. Ltd. has been issued an official warning by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), according to a press release April 25.Citing articles of the Supplementary Provisions Act on Financial Settlement, the FSA issued the company an improvement notice, which obliges them to rectify any inconsistencies or shortcomings in their business operations.The inspection of Everybody’s Bitcoin Co. Ltd. cryptocurrency exchange reportedly revealed that the company has not established an effective internal management control system to ensure proper operation of business.The exchange has been ordered to prepare statutory books, provide appropriate information to users, and ensure effective system security controls. The FSA also cited inconsistencies in the exchange’s measures for anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorism financing.In March, the FSA sent ‘punishment notices’ to seven other digital currency exchanges, including Coincheck, and temporarily halted the operation of two more due to a lack of “the proper and required internal control systems.”Earlier this week, it was reported that Japan is about to get its first self-regulatory body for cryptocurrency exchanges. The country’s sixteen licensed exchange operators took steps to finally launch what will become known as the Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Association (JCEA).

Aims And Goals Of Japan’s New Self-Regulatory Cryptocurrency Exchange Association,Darryn Pollock,4/26/2018 20:12,16050,249,"Regulation in Japan has taken a long and winding route - the Asian country was the first to recognize Bitcoin as a form of legal tender, but it is also the country where the two biggest hacks in the history of this ecosystem happened; Mt. Gox & Coincheck.The latter hack, which saw thieves make off with $530 mln in NEM, prompted Japanese regulators to step in and address security concerns at many of the exchanges in the country.But it is not only the regulators who are reacting to the Coincheck hack. A self-regulatory body has been set up off the backs of the exchanges in order to secure their businesses, as well as to get in line with the tougher regulatory pressures.This body has had its first press conference on April 23, where it outlined its initial and key areas of concern, areas it will be tackling from the outset. The conference was followed by Cointelegraph.The official name of the body is Nihon Kasotsuka Kokangyo Kyokai (Japan Cryptocurrency Exchange Association) and it currently consists of the 16 exchanges registered with the government’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).The idea behind this body is for it to set the standards and the expectations of those exchanges that currently are not registered and up to scratch with the FSA. This is because there are still currently a number of exchanges that are operating while still being unregistered.However, as the crackdown continues, there have been some some exchanges that have decided to shut up shop than bend to the wants of the regulators and prove their security.The FSA strongly urged cryptocurrency exchanges to establish a unified industry organization and voluntarily work out rules and regulations to create a sound trading environment for customers. This led the the creation of the Japan cryptocurrency exchange association (JCEA).The group that are taking charge of this self-regulatory stance are those that have already been registered with the FSA, some of the more recognisable ones include the following.Bitbank’s main trading coin is Ripple, which accounts for 75 percent of its volume, followed by Bitcoin, at 14 percent, and Bitcoin Cash at 7 percent. It has a market capitalisation of $180,614,933, or 20,260 BTC. It was founded in May 2014.Bitflyer primarily operates with Bitcoin, with 98 percent of its $277,779,010 coming from Bitcoin. It was founded in January of 2014.This exchange only offers Bitcoin trading and has a rather small market cap of $84,399,400, or 9,467 BTC. It was founded in 2014.This exchange operates mainly with Bitcoin, accounting for 96 percent of volume, but it also allows trade in Mona coin, it’s only other altcoin. It has a market cap of $147,435,081 and was founded in 2016.Quoine offers many different coins for trade, but primarily sees its volume being made up of Bitcoin, with 88 percent volume coming from that digital currency. Its market cap is $261,973,798 and it was founded in 2014.Taizen Okuyama, president of Money Partners Co. who assumed the post of chairman, said the goal of the JCEA is to dispel customers’ anxieties and achieve the sound development of the market.At a press conference held in Tokyo earlier this week, Okuyama said:“We are preparing self-regulation rules from now on, we want to aim for further development of the industry and generalization of the virtual currency, dispeling anxiety of customers that came about from the case of Choincheck, restoring confidence.”JBA executive director Yuzo Kano, the vice president of the organization, added:“The establishment of the association is a meaningful step in the development of the industry and emphasizes that it will develop more speedily and help obtain effective self-regulation.”""Japan's trend is drawing attention from the world, I would like to work seriously so that it will become a norm for other countries.""Noriyuki Hiromatsu, who is also President of Bitbank, also became Vice chairman and added that he is happy to be cooperating on such a level.“I am very pleased to be able to unite and cooperate like this, as the industry has not been able to line up very well. I would like to prepare self-regulation early and create an environment that can be used with confidence.”The men at the front of the press conference continued to spell out the inner workings of how the regulatory body would operate. They explained the processes of getting registered, the time frame it would take and how they would handle initial coin offerings (ICOs).Okuyama explained that the office of the regulatory body is just beginning to be set up, but that they would also be forming an inspection group in order to asses exchanges and their security.With regard to ICOs, the president explained that the authorities would be judging the coins involved, but the exchange operators will have to make notice when listing new coins, and that registration needs to be accepted by the regulatory body.Okuyama also explained that there are some exchanges that are not currently part of the regulatory system that are essentially operating in the traditional measures of Japanese law, and he is looking to quickly incorporate them into the self-regulatory system.Kano also interjected to explain the security measures that are expected from the JCEA in order to get registered.He said that security is roughly divided between two areas. Firstly, there is that of conventional Internet security, including SSL, firewalls and non-Blockchain related protection. Then there is security unique to the Blockchain. To this end, there needs to be detailed rules and expectations in order to create a security model.Eventually, Kano wants it to be so clear-cut that a third-party operator would make a call in a certain exchange’s security.There will be some questioning if this is a good move from Japan, or not. Regulations are such a sticky issue, but this seems to find a middle ground that many can accept.The battle between governments, banks and the likes, against those vested in the new and unregulated cryptocurrency ecosystem has seen some fierce skirmishes. Those in places like China have been forced out, while those in Australia have struck a balance that works for both parties.Japan’s move is one that also seems to strike a balance. By having an organization that is run by those involved in cryptocurrencies and that understand the needs of cryptocurrency exchanges, there is room for rules to flourish which do not stifle innovation and growth.Having a healthy relationship between the FSA in Japan and this new body means that there is communication between the two areas. Security concerns are being addressed, but the rules are not simply being dictated down.As Kano mentioned in the press conference, the world is indeed watching Japan, and this latest regulatory move could be met with open arms from both sides, across the globe.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Coincheck    #Hackers    #Exchanges

On this basis, SCC was ordered to pay Mr. Zhao's costs in relation to the legal proceedings.”The statement adds that Zhao will make no further comment on the situation.Binance is the number one crypto exchange by 24 hour trading volume on CoinMarketCap, reporting around $2.6 billion in trading today.

Buda sued the banks after what it said was an “unjustified” closing of its accounts.Earlier this month, a group of exchanges in Chile filed legal action against the banks’ decision to shut down their accounts. Buda, Orionx, and CrytpoMarket say that the banking system has taken unilateral action in Chile that’s “killing the entire industry.”In an interview with Cointelegraph, Buda CEO Guillermo Torrealba said that while Chile would like to show itself as open and liberal to new technologies, the veneer is thin:“Chile is showing its ""B"" side, that of being an extremely conservative country, even though we make huge efforts for the world to see us as liberals.”According to Torrealba, despite an outcry in the media and on Twitter, banks refuse to respond. He says that the powerful banking sector is making the environment for cryptocurrency worse than Ecuador, Bolivia, or China.Torrealba emphasized that there are no laws, rulings, or legislation that prevent crypto firms from operating normally, rather the banking sector has taken on the role of a hegemonic regulator:“There hasn't been one regulator, legislator or government official saying that cryptocurrencies aren’t legal, it was just the decision of a very powerful sector of the economy: the banking industry.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Chile    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Government    #Banks

Venture Capital Firm Sequoia Sues Binance Founder Over Funding Deal,Marie Huillet,4/25/2018 11:31,15171,142,"Venture capital firm Sequoia is suing Zhao Changpeng, the CEO and founder of Binance, currently the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, for allegedly breaching an exclusivity agreement during negotiations for an investment deal which broke down last year, Bloomberg reported April 25.Sequoia has now appealed to Hong Kong’s High Court to secure a temporary injunction to bar Zhao from negotiating with other investors, causing the dispute to go public and revealing insights into VC firms’ past valuations of the exchange.Citing the High Court documents, Bloomberg reports that Zhao and Sequoia began negotiating terms in August 2017 for an 11% stake investment in Binance, at a proposed valuation of $80 million. The talks continued as Bitcoin’s trading price soared to $20,000 in mid-December, at which point Zhao’s negotiators broke off talks, considering that the deal undervalued the exchange.As the Sequoia deal fell through, the alleged exclusivity agreement breach involved another VC investment firm, IDG Capital, which reportedly expressed interest in investing in Binance over two funding rounds, at significantly higher valuations of $400 mln and $1 bln respectively.Bloomberg reports that IDG has responded to the news outlet’s questions, stating that it has not invested in Binance and has no relationship with the exchange. Sequoia and Zhao, meanwhile, reportedly intend to settle their dispute in arbitration.In previous interviews with Bloomberg, Zhao has claimed his personal fortune is worth as much as $2 bln, but declined requests to provide proof of his wealth and grant access to the Binance’s financial statements. He has also reportedly said that Binance does not need investment from VC investment firms, and is only interested in partnerships if doing so would help the exchange to secure operating licenses from regulators.It remains to be seen whether Binance’s multi-country presence can insulate it from the traditional financial system and secure room for manoeuvre from regulatory requirements.When Japan’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) recently ordered Hong Kong-based Binance to halt its operations in Japan for its failure to register the exchange, Zhao announced the company would open an office in Malta.

The BITREAL Real Estate Blockchain Opportunities Fund 1 (BREBCO 1) will reportedly be the first such fund in Germany to combine cryptocurrencies and real estate.The strategy of BREBCO 1 is to invest in Blockchain technology through established tokens and coins as well as core commercial real estate, partly financed by bank loans, in the leading 10 economic regions in Germany. The fund says it expects to generate a 15 percent return annually over a seven-year lifetime, and is reportedly aiming for an equity volume of €40 mln (almost $49 mln).In order to attract cryptocurrency holders to invest, the fund offers the possibility for investors to deposit Bitcoin and Ethereum in addition to Euro.

MIT Comes Up With Three Ways To Destroy Bitcoin,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/24/2018 8:59,52991,397,"The MIT Technology Review has published an article today, April 24, called “Let’s Destroy Bitcoin,” detailing three ways that the cryptocurrency could be “brought down.”The first option, according to the article, is a government takeover of Bitcoin with the creation of a Federal Reserve-backed coin (Fedcoin):“The year is two-thousand-something-big, and it’s the day your taxes are due. But you don’t file them. Instead an algorithm automatically makes a withdrawal from your electronic wallet, in a currency called Fedcoin.”This new blockchain would have verified financial institutions as the authorized nodes instead of peer-to-peer networks, “basically, trusted institutions,” Yale undergrad Sahil Gupta told the MIT Technology Review. The article notes that the Bank of Canada built a simulation of such a system on Ethereum (ETH) in 2016.Option two is a Facebook stealth takeover of Bitcoin, which involves the social media site creating a BTC wallet for all of its users, rewarding them in the cryptocurrency for interacting with ads, and giving them an ad-free experience if they let Facebook mine on their computer’s unused power (as Salon offered earlier this year):“If Facebook could persuade a large enough fraction of Bitcoin users and miners to run its own proprietary version of the Bitcoin software, the company would thereafter control the rules. It could then refashion Bitcoin as a corporate version of the Fedcoin described above.”Facebook could also take control away from Bitcoin by issuing their own cryptocurrency, just like messaging app Telegram is in the process of doing after their combined $1.7 bln Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) held earlier this year.The third way of making Bitcoin “irrelevant” is the creation of multiple new cryptocurrencies for every situation:“You’re in the checkout line at the grocery store. Inside your phone’s digital wallet you find not only Fedcoin and FacebookCoin but also AppleCash, ToyotaCash, and a coin specific to the store you’re standing in. There’s also a coin redeemable for babysitting services, and another that gets you rides on your local subway system.”This option, according to MIT Technology Review, is “already happening,” as companies are creating their own coins or tokens to be used just for their services, like Kodak’s ICO to form a currency used to license photographs.How Bitcoin can prevent any of these options from taking place is to capitalize on its advantages, namely that “Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and impossible to censor.”However, the article notes that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is already attempting to link people’s identities with their BTC addresses, according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, and if governments “seek to create and enforce blacklists,” they could pressure the “crucial” BTC miners.At the end of March, Snowden had said in an interview that Bitcoin’s Blockchain ledger was “devastatingly public” and that a good alternative to fiat that cannot be controlled by the government has not yet appeared.MIT Technology review concludes that “if cryptocurrencies are to be widely used, it will be the habits of the masses, not the wishes of Bitcoin’s early adopters, that determine what becomes of Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision.”",36,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #MIT    #Federal Reserve    #Facebook    #Bank of Canada    #Telegram    #ICO    #NSA    #Edward Snowden

How British Financial Regulator Creates A Foundation For UK Cryptocurrency Adoption,Gareth Jenkinson,4/23/2018 20:04,9879,363,"Traditional financial institutions and big banks in the UK haven’t been overly supportive of cryptocurrencies over the years, but change could be on the horizon.2018 has seen a big move for positive regulatory action towards cryptocurrencies around the world and England’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has embraced this change as well.In March the FCA announced that it had launched a cryptocurrency task force in association with the Bank of England in order to explore ways to regulate and foster the expanding cryptocurrency sector.They also launched a global fintech sandbox, which intends to foster and fast-track fintech development by bringing tech companies together from around the world.The FCA has since confirmed that it will deliver an analytical report on the state of cryptocurrencies later this year and has already delivered a guideline document for financial institutions looking to launch cryptocurrency derivative offerings.As Cointelegraph reported last month, there has long been an apathetic attitude towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from the likes of the Bank of England and other mainstream financial institutions.Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, all but condemned Bitcoin in an address in February at London’s Regent University. The only positive take away were remarks towards the underlying Blockchain technology.MIT Professor of Economics John van Reenen told Cointelegraph that it seemed unlikely that these financial giants would change their tune towards cryptocurrencies, but these latest moves by the British financial regulator suggest that may not be true.Some analysts in the UK believe the FCA is making positive steps that could make England an attractive base for tech companies and Blockchain startups.Jacob Ghanty, a partner at UK law firm Kemp Little, told that the FCA is trying to get ahead of the curve, as the world at large warms to the idea of cryptocurrencies:“At a high level, there is pressure on the UK authorities to develop a comprehensive strategy towards crypto, as sooner or later the EU will develop its own approach meaning there will need to be compelling reasons for crypto firms to locate in the UK.”A glaring concern around the world has been the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, which puts investors at risk. However, that hasn’t changed the fact that there has been considerable interest in the sector.To that end, the FCA is walking down the trail that was blazed by American exchange operators late last year.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) were the first to launch Bitcoin Futures contracts, which were initially met with positive sentiments and a bump in the price of Bitcoin. A week later, Bitcoin reached its zenith at $20,000 and soon began a humbling correction.None of this would have been possible without the support from America’s Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which allowed the likes of the CME and CBOE to launch their cryptocurrency futures options.Furthermore the CFTC and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) promised to create regulatory guidelines that would contribute to the growth of ICOs, cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology in a hearing in February.In a similar vein, the FCA has noted the appetite for financial offerings like derivatives for the cryptocurrency markets in the UK. They’ve reacted by providing a clear-cut message to companies launching these type of financial instruments.While there are no regulations for cryptocurrencies in the UK at present, the FCA has made it clear that firms looking to offer futures, contracts for differences and cryptocurrencies options must adhere to existing regulations set out by the British financial regulator.As per the statement released on the FCA website in April, any of these instruments must comply to existing regulatory guidelines, with three specific references made:It’s hard to predict what to expect from the pending cryptocurrency review. If the prevailing rhetoric from British banks and financial institutions is anything to go by, the FCA could produce a report that continues to keep cryptocurrencies at an arms length.They’ve made no qualms about the significant interest in the applications of Blockchain technology as a means of verifying transactions in traditional financial systems, but whether they will produce an optimistic outlook on the likes of Bitcoin and its altcoin brethren remains to be seen.British Conservative Member of Parliament Matt Hancock delivered a speech at the London Blockchain Conference on April 19, predicting the ‘monumental impact’ Blockchain technology will have in the coming years.He highlighted how the UK government has already donated 10 mln pounds to various Blockchain projects ranging from energy to voting systems.Encouragingly, Hancock also made mention of the Cryptoassests Taskforce, which he claims ‘will set out an approach that balances the need to encourage innovation and growth, whilst managing the risks’.Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of financial consultancy deVere Group, believes:“First, because of the sheer numbers of people it will directly affect.  There’s been incredible growth of the cryptocurrency market in recent years. This growth can be expected to soar further and quicker over the next decade as more and more investors pile into the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and Dash, and as adoption by businesses and organisations further increases.“Second, the FCA is one of the world’s most influential and respected financial regulators.  As such, it can be expected to help shape and define the thinking and policies of regulators globally, the majority of which in the major economies are now also carefully looking at the crypto space.”Should the FCA follow in the footsteps of the SEC and CFTC, cryptocurrencies could see a surge in support in the UK and Europe once the report is published. This will be a long awaited boost for the market which has suffered in the first quarter of 2018.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Adoption    #UK  
Central Bank Of Iran Bans Banks From Crypto Dealings,Marie Huillet,4/23/2018 11:45,13620,310,"The central bank of Iran has banned domestic banks and other financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrencies, citing money-laundering concerns first raised in a circular from December 2017, Reuters reported Sunday, April 22.Reuters cites Iran’s state-run news agency IRNA as saying Sunday:""Banks and credit institutions and currency exchanges should avoid any sale or purchase of these currencies or taking any action to promote them.”Today, April 23, Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (REFRL) cites further details from the December circular:“All cryptocurrencies have the capacity to be turned into a means for money-laundering and financing terrorism and in general can be turned into a means for transferring criminals' money.”The ban comes as the country braces itself for the possible renewal of U.S. sanctions on May 12, which has seen the national currency, the rial, plunge to unprecedented lows. Reuters further reports that Iran has unified its official and open market exchange rates and banned all money changing outside of banks, as it attempts to prop up the country's ailing financial institutions and halt further currency slumps.Iran’s stance towards crypto toughened notably in February 2018, when local media quoted the central bank’s intent to “control and prevent” what it views as “highly unreliable and risky” digital currencies.Concurrent reports in February of Iran’s inquiry into issuing a state-back digital currency prompted comparisons with Venezuela’s centrally-issued Petro, which many have viewed as a response to the country’s own crippling international sanctions.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Iran    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies  
"India: Delhi High Court Seeks Response From Central Bank On Recent Crypto Ban, Report Says",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/22/2018 14:25,25900,658,"The High Court of Delhi has reportedly issued a notice to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Ministry of Finance, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council alleging that RBI’s decision to end dealings with crypto businesses violates the constitution, local news outlet Times of India reports today, April 22.The High Court’s notice is reportedly in response to a claim filed by crypto company Kali Digital last week. After the RBI released a circular on April 5 stating that they would no longer provide services to a person or a business that deals in cryptocurrency, an online petition to reverse the ban was started, gaining over 43,000 signatures by press time.Kali Digital, which runs the crypto exchange CoinRecoil, set to be launched in August 2018, filed an official claim on April 16, stating that RBI’s circular violates constitutional Articles 19 (1) (g) – allowing citizens the right to any occupation, trade, or business – and Article 14 – prohibiting  discrimination between equals. The High Court of Delhi’s notice, issued by Judges S. Ravindra Bhat and A. K. Chawla, asks for a response from the three parties involved by May 24.Kali Digital believes that RBI’s decision will prevent CoinRecoil’s business operations in an unconstitutional manner, according to an excerpt of the claim written in local news outlet The Economic Times:“On account of the impugned circular, the petitioner will not be able to avail banking services to operate the cryptocurrency exchange ‘CoinRecoil’. Such banking services are imperative for the business of the petitioner. Consequently, the business [...] is stillborn.”Kali Digital included the GST Council in the claim due to what they see as a failure to ""frame appropriate regulation on crypto-currencies [sic] [...] [that] increased the uncertainty over treatment of such transactions and is adversely affecting the proposed business of the petitioner,” the Times of India writes.Tech investor and crypto enthusiast Tim Draper had also responded negatively to the RBI’s circular, saying in an interview that the Indian government’s refusal to recognize cryptocurrency as valid tender is “the stupidest thing” and that he would have told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that RBI’s crypto ban is a “huge mistake.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Tim Draper    #Banks    #Government    #Banned Bitcoin  
Mark Wetjen Wants Regulation to Encourage Bitcoin Innovators to Remain in U.S.,Cheryl Hulseapple,11/7/2014 11:28,134,0,"On November 4, Mark Wetjen wrote an oped in the Wall Street Journal asking regulators to steer clear of harming Bitcoin. Wetjen is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and a Democrat.As reportedin The Hill, he said the goal should be to ""lay the groundwork for future innovation"" and to ""build confidence in consumers currently leery of embracing the new technology."" Events such as Mt. Gox, Silk Road, and today's seizure of Silk Road 2, along with the shutdown of other dark markets, “shake the public’s confidence in Bitcoin.”Other regulators have spoken about their own lack of confidence and have advocated a complete ban of Bitcoin. Earlier this year, CT reported that Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wrote a letter addressed to Wetjen and other financial regulators, determined to wipe the currency from use in the United States because, he said, it poses “a massive threat” and is “disruptive” to the U.S. economy.Charles Schumer (D-NY), who called for the shutdown of the original Silk Road two years before it happened, sent out a press release just last week asking for a greater targeting of illegal sales on the dark web. Is it a coincidence that today, he got exactly that?Regulatory framework should be ""flexible and rational,"" Wetjen said on Tuesday. He stated his desire for ""serious [Bitcoin] innovators to choose to work within the US rather than avoid it.” He advised that “creating a flexible and rational regulatory framework is the best way for regulators to respond” to illegal incidents.In other words, prevention in the form of Bitcoin-supportive regulation might provide better support to the overall U.S. economy, rather than reaction, like we’ve seen more of today. Did you enjoy this article?

"JP Morgan, Bankers: Bitcoin Can Only Compete if it ‘Conforms to Regulations’",Matchpool,10/13/2014 17:41,214,0,"If comments from JPMorgan's CEO are any indication, the financial giant considers Bitcoin a competitor — and it plans to compete.Bitcoin developers “are going to try and eat our lunch,” JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Exectutive James Dimon said, at the Institute of International Finance annual meeting, as reported by Institutional Investor. “And that’s fine. That’s called competition, and we’ll be competing,” he added.The Institute of International Finance is a global financial alliance; the world's financial leaders congregate annually for the membership conference, where the discussion cropped up.Debate raged over the state of regulations, and Bitcoin's ability to harmonize. Financial leaders argued that the only way Bitcoin can compete is if it conforms to regulations.Dimon defended leading financial institutions and argued for a role for government, stating:“When people form nations, one of the first things they do is form a currency. Are regulators and governments really going to foster Bitcoin over a long period of time? I think the answer is no.”Music, retail, and media have transformed over the past decade. “Why has that disruption not happened in finance?” Co-CEO of Deutsche Bank Anshu Jain asked rhetorically. “There's a very straightforward reason: regulation.”On the other hand, CEO of SecondMarket Barry Silbert said:“Two years ago I would have said the biggest obstacle to growth of Bitcoin was regulation, now I think it's the biggest opportunity.”For those following JPMorgan Chase's dealings in Bitcoin, these comments may come as no surprise. JP Morgan has made some mildly antagonistic moves towards Bitcoin.Nearly a year ago the company filed a patent for a digital currency system that shares some similarities with Bitcoin — like anonymity and easy global transfer –– but brings it under a centralized umbrella.Then JPMorgan Head of International Rates Strategy, John Normand, released an unfavorable report: “At the risk of sounding like a Luddite unable to recognize the transformative effects of evolving technologies –– Bitcoin looks like an innovation worth limiting exposure to.” He called cryptocurrency “vastly inferior” to fiat.The relationship between traditional and “fringe” financial interests seems to be taking on a love-hate character. Back in August, the largest European Bank in the euro-zone, Santander, commissioned a study on the impact of cryptocurrencies on the banking industry, while back in July, Ireland’s Central Bank official acknowledged the disruptive potential of the nascent technology.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #JPMorgan    #Banks  
Andreas Antonopoulos to Canada’s Senate: ‘There is No Need for Centralized Regulation’,Allen Scott,10/10/2014 15:53,192,0,"On October 8, one of the most prominent thought leaders in the crypto space, Andreas Antonopoulos, was invited to share his views and knowledge on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.The session of the Senate of Canada’s Banking, Trade and Commerce committee, which focused mostly on the regulatory aspect of digital currencies, lasted for almost 2 hours and has been widely lauded by the Bitcoin community. The presentation also echoed the voice of the Bitcoin Embassy, the Bitcoin Foundation Canada and the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, which also testified before the committee on October 2.The Canada-based Bitcoin Embassy has announced its full endorsement of Andreas’ presentation. “The Bitcoin Embassy greatly appreciates M. Antonopoulos’ intervention in the Canadian debate regarding cryptocurrency,” reads the official press release. “And we are happy to endorse M. Antonopoulos’ testimony, which will certainly be retained as a key source of expertise for Canadian policy-makers.”As reported by Cointelegraph back in August, regulations for cryptocurrencies in Canada are expected to go into effect in 2015.Andreas made some poignant statements before the committee. He said:“[…] entities near the center of a traditional financial network are vested with enormous power, act with full authority, and therefore must be carefully investigated, regulated and subject to oversight […] to ensure that the central actors do not abuse their authority and power for their own profit.”On the contrary, in decentralized systems such as Bitcoin:“There is no center to the network, no central authority, no concentration of power and no actor in whom complete trust must be vested. […] Bitcoin does not force users to surrender their identity with every transaction and put their trust in a chain of supposedly vetted intermediaries who must be trusted to control access to, securely store, and protect transaction data […] Because in Bitcoin trust is not vested in central actors, there is no need for centralized regulation and oversight.”One of the main takeaways from these statements is that the need for regulation decreases with innovation.Nonetheless, in today’s Bitcoin environment, there exist many services which take on the role of processing and storing users’ bitcoins. Such entities produce centralization, and should thus, Antonopoulos argues, be subject to the same regulatory oversight as fiat-based operations.“In short, ‘if control over the user's funds has been centralized, then that institution puts consumers at risk,’” the results of the meeting note.However, it is also noted that innovation in the space is constantly devolving responsibility back to the consumer, meaning that as time progresses, fewer centralized environments will be simulated and thus less regulation will be required.“I think this technology needs time to breathe”, Antonopoulos states, “it needs time to show the full potential of what is possible with decentralized, programmable money”.The onus on the consumer to be in control of their funds is not only a good thing, but the way forward, he continues.“Bitcoin’s decentralized nature affords consumer protection in the most powerful and direct way – by allowing bitcoin users direct control over the privacy of their financial transactions. Bitcoin does not force users to surrender their identity with every transaction and put their trust in a chain of supposedly vetted intermediaries who must be trusted to control access to, securely store, and protect transaction data and vulnerable account identifiers. Bitcoin transactions never expose vulnerable account identifiers and bitcoin users can protect the privacy of their transactions without relying on, or trusting, any intermediaries.”The state of flux in Bitcoin, amid the rapid growth of a complex infrastructure servicing both business and consumers, was what spoke particularly clearly to the committee. Antonopoulos was keen to vouch his approval in response to the meeting’s final question, which proposed recommending no regulation for the time being, and allowing the space to mature before revisiting the issue in the next few years.“I think that would be a very good idea,” he said.“I think there is some room for clarification, clarifying for example the tax status for individuals or at least clarifying the right of an individual to make choice in the currency they use as a consumer, and to affirm the legality of using digital currencies in all forms of commerce as entirely equivalent to any other national currency... Recognizing this is a private form of barter and transaction, recognizing the corresponding principles, which I consider neutral principles, but they are principles of enlightenment, which are freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience.”He concluded, “So I think that removing ambiguity in that particular arena for personal use would be enormously useful.”His final response gained much applause from the community, with Reddit in particular echoing the Senate’s support and gratitude for Antonopoulos’ appearance and explanations.The results of the consultation will be uniquely interesting in demonstrating the Bitcoin community’s influence on legislation directly, without the input of a middleman in the form of a working group, think tank or otherwise.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Antonopoulos  
TeraExchange completes world’s first regulated Bitcoin Derivatives exchange,William Suberg,10/10/2014 15:27,188,0,"Derivatives marketplace TeraExchange has announced it has fulfilled the first ever Bitcoin derivatives trade on a regulated exchange.The trade, in the form of TeraExchange’s USD/BTC swap service, was made between digitalBTC and a hedging counterparty. digitalBTC is itself he world’s first Bitcoin-focused company to commence trading on a major stock exchange.“There is significant, growing demand for a hedging instrument like this,” said Christian Martin, CEO and co-founder of TeraExchange in a press release issued Thursday. “Not only does the swap provide a much-needed risk management tool but it instills confidence and credibility to the entire Bitcoin community at a vital time in the market’s development.”The landmark event follows the culmination of TeraExchange’s self-certification procedure which it says will “ensure that the swap and the Tera Bitcoin Price Index satisfied the rules and regulations of the federal regulator.” The company worked closely with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over a six-month period in order to finalize its position.“After months of refining the swap and the index we are excited that bitcoin derivatives trading has commenced on our platform,” TeraExchange president and co-founder Leonard T. Nuara commented.Trading on TeraExchange itself is facilitated by liquidity providers including digitalBTC whose CIO Bill Brindise was quick to point out the value of the partnership.“We are delighted to be working closely with TeraExchange and are excited they have created a regulated platform for institutional traders,” he said, adding: “This swap is an important investment vehicle that has been sorely needed by Bitcoin investors, retailers and miners. Like TeraExchange, digitalBTC is no stranger to regulation since stock exchange listing requirements mandate complete transparency into our business activities and financial reporting.”At the heart of TeraExchange is its Tera Bitcoin Price Index, which is used as the settlement rate for its swaps. The index uses a dynamic algorithm that compiles and filters data in real time from a number of Bitcoin exchanges. “In order to be included in the Index these exchanges are required to execute and maintain an information sharing agreement with TeraExchange, as required by the CFTC,” the press release states.Additionally, both TeraExchange and digitalBTC took part at the CFTC Global Markets Advisory Committee meeting held on Oct 9.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #TeraExchange    #Bitcoin Exchanges  
"Banks Want Bitcoin Regulated, But See Same Benefits We Do",Ian DeMartino,9/22/2014 19:47,184,0,"Bank-less money is one way I've heard Bitcoin described, from some folks who have experience in the traditional finance system no less, because it is a more friendly way to explain it than “cryptocurrency” and exemplifies many of the advantages of the digital currency.It is also a general feeling among the cryptocurrency community that Bitcoin is gift from up high that will bring the bankers and wall street jackals and debt traders to their knees. We like to imagine that Bitcoin represents the end of their reign as 'king of the debt slaves' and we imagine they sit in their high rise towers and fearfully devise plans designed to bring about Bitcoin's destruction.The other popular image of banker's current thoughts on Bitcoin is that they are completely ignorant about it. That they, like the politicians they control, are completely out of touch with reality and see Bitcoin as an internet cultural oddity sure to pass just like Pants on the Ground, The Dancing Baby or Planking.The truth, at least judging by a document detailing the Fed's recent meeting with the Federal Advisory Council, who, according to the Federal Reserve's website “is composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry” could be something much closer to how we look at the currency.What little attention this document did receive from the press, including from the Cato institute, focused on the fact that the Banks are advocating regulation on Bitcoin, I do not mean to imply that is insiginifcant. What is especially important is that they are advocating for many of more unpopular aspects found in the BitLicense regulation. However, there is something else included in the report that I think is being overlooked: even bankers see the advantages inherent in the Bitcoin system.The bankers in the meeting did not list Bitcoin as a threat to the industry in the short term. However, they noted that “Bitcoin’s longer-term impact could be more pronounced and require adaptation by payment processors.” Among the reasons why, are many of the same reasons Bitcoin evangelicals have been preaching the currency's adoption for years.According to the document, the bankers note Bitcoin's low cost transaction fees (and its appeal to merchants) the advantages it offers the “unbanked” in the third world, its “geographic flexibility” and “faster settlement” (faster transactions) as the digital currency's main advantages.Advantages that, the bankers say, “[do] not present a threat to economic activity by disrupting traditional channels of commerce; rather, it could serve as a boon.”They even went as far as dispelling some misconceptions about Bitcoin, admitting that while Bitcoin is often used in illicit transactions “ sovereign-issued currencies and other precious goods are similarly used.” And wisely point out that Bitcoin is better described as pseudonymous rather than anonymous.That said, it isn't all roses and sunshine. They do, as mentioned, suggest that Bitcoin be regulated in a fashion very similar to the BitLicense legislation making its way through New York right now. They also see some negatives preventing the currency from taking off, most notably its lack of stability and what many see as a positive, its finite supply.But, it shouldn't be surprising to us that Bankers are calling for regulation of Bitcoin, even as they attempt to lessen regulation for themselves. What is significant here, is that Bitcoin's advantages seem undeniable, even to those that run the legacy system it seeks to replace.Did you enjoy this article?

"Startup Investor and Ex Skype COO: “People Need to Speak, People Need to Transact”",Allen Scott,9/20/2014 18:05,349,0,"Michael Jackson is an engineer, entrepreneur and investor at Mangrove Capital Partners.Michael started working at Skype back in 2004 and until 2007, helping to create corporate partnerships and develop the company during his tenure period. At Skype, Michael gained a vast amount of experience and market know-how with respect to distributed P2P networks; he also understands what is needed to gain mass adoption of game-changing, disruptive technology from both legal and business perspectives.Michael’s Bio on the Mangrove Capital Partners’ website reads:“I met the Mangrove team during my days as Chief Operating Officer of Skype and joined the firm as a Partner in 2007, after a 25 years career in the Telecom industry. During those years, I had the opportunity to work for, grow and start myself a dozen different businesses.At Mangrove, my first role is to lead our effort in the Mobile space, an exciting market being created right in front of our eyes. Of course, I look for big ideas. But above this, I look for the passion, drive and ambition in a founding team, and a genuine reason why they believe they can dominate their sector. I like to work closely with unusual entrepreneurs and need to feel some connection to them. Then, I also use my previous experience in fast-growing environments to help our companies scale and develop their revenue-generating activities.I currently serve on the boards of Evertale, Jolicloud, Pops, SohoOS and Waratek.I grew up in the UK, completed my graduate training at the BBC and after that, I launched off into startup land, as lead engineer at the first competitive phone company in the UK, which sold to Vodafone. Then, I moved to Denmark, and launched 9 mobile operations and 2 ISPs across Europe with Tele2. All were high growth operations with millions of paying customers.  Some were very successful, others less so.  Then, I joined the founding team of Skype that I had met at Tele2. As the COO of the company, I was responsible for rapidly growing an idea into a well managed multi-million dollar business.After 18 years living in Denmark, I now live in Luxembourg, but travel every week and weekend around Europe to meet existing and potential companies. Spare time for me is about debating with people who challenge me intellectually.”Cointelegraph: Based on your first hand experience in navigating regulators and helping build Skype into a global business, can you draw any similarities between the problems faced by Skype then and Bitcoin today?Michael Jackson: The overriding similarity is quite simple. Both Bitcoin and Skype solve a long standing, but necessary, need by introducing a radically different form of both technology and business model. People need to speak, people need to transact. Technological evolution (the open internet for Skype, the public Blockchain for Bitcoin) renders the business hierarchy, or perhaps ‘who is responsible’ on its head. The effect here is that the regulations and organizations simply cannot be matched.“Both Bitcoin and Skype solve a long standing, but necessary, need by introducing a radically different form of both technology and business model. People need to speak, people need to transact.”CT: You stated that Skype would have never caught on if it was based in the US instead of Estonia. Where do you think Bitcoin has the best chance to gain a foothold?MJ: I do not think that Bitcoin will catch on in a geography, after all the Internet is de-facto non geographical. I believe it will catch on in a sector. Authentication service, notarial services, micro transaction, cross border transactions are my favorites right now.CT: Previously, you stated that Bitcoin companies should refrain from striving towards regulatory compliance if they can make a case that they don’t need it. Could you explain why this is important?MJ: Regulations are a huge cost. Not just in cash, but in the ability of a business to adjust business model and, in general, act independently. No startup business can afford restrictions on its behavior - but some are necessary. The job is to reduce these as much as possible.CT: What is your opinion on the recently proposed NY State BitLicenses? Do you think the recent 45-day extension will improve the legislation? MJ: Any consultancy period improves legislation - legislators ask for comments and generally wish to take these comments into consideration. Of course it requires that we all contribute to the hearings. I hope everyone did.My opinion is reasonably positive. I would like there to be a ‘limit’ whereby small transactions are exempt, as they are under normal financial services legislation - but given the issues we have seen within the industry concerning lack of ability to safeguard client funds, I think we have only ourselves to blame.CT: What is you opinion on the Australia’s recently proposed regulations of Bitcoin businesses?MJ: The Australian regulations express three different opinions. The first is that if you accept bitcoins instead of something else as payment, or indeed pay people in bitcoins, then they should be treated in the same way. In other words, if you pay someone in Bitcoins for work, then you must consider them in the same way as if you paid in AUD. For example, withhold social security payments etc.The second is that if they are being used as an asset - buying, selling, making profits etc - then you will be taxable on the gains. This is also a direct parallel with any other asset - a painting, a car, anything.Both of these are consistent with the real world, and this consistency seems reasonable. The final area concerns GST. Here the ruling seems less clear. There is a risk of double taxation in the proposed description - but since that is unlikely to be the intention, I would hope that this gets flushed out in the consultation period.CT: You are currently a partner at venture capital firm Mangrove Capital Partners which helps innovative entrepreneurs start and grow global, disruptive companies. With $500 million under management, what Bitcoin companies have you invested in so far? What companies are you currently looking into?MJ: I am looking at businesses that can gain a central place in the value chain of the Bitcoin economy. Businesses that can use the blockchain effectively to offer products are interesting. I am not so interested in exchanges or wallet solutions.CT: In your opinion, what do you see as the biggest hurdle to mainstream Bitcoin adoption ?MJ: Consistency of regulatory approach - which will give confidence to everyone in the ecosystem (from banks and FIAT operators, through to merchants and service providers).Did you enjoy this article?

Luxembourg Startup CoinPlus Will Soon Face Regulators,Diana Ngo,9/19/2014 10:52,219,0,"Luxembourg-based Bitcoin startup CoinPlus raises €172,500 in a first round of funding, and waits to meet with Luxembourg's financial regulator at the end of September.In a press release, CoinPlus CEO Christian Bodt, said there was still a long way to go, but remains optimistic. He added that an additional funding round was planned to occur before the end of the year.""The choice of Luxembourg was [obvious]. The country offers high-standard technical and administrative infrastructures, service providers at the cutting edge of technology, proximity with relevant authorities, as well as great open-mindedness. [Luxembourg] is also a reliable place for agents from the financial world.""- Christian BodtCoinPlus holds three major projects that are a multi-support payment processor, a digital currency exchange platform, and a secured fund transfer solution.The startup was launched in July 2014, couple months after Luxembourg's financial regulator the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) announced it recognized Bitcoin as a scriptural currency, and thus, as a legal tender. Bodt said he will be meeting with the regulator in couple days.  The entrepreneur stated he has always been passionate about peer-to-peer technologies, and started his career in the financial sector as a grid computing python applications specialist. He worked as a software consultant and a python expert at prominent financial institutions including UBS Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan and French bank Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank. Bodt said his encounter with lead core Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen in 2011, convinced him to install a Bitcoin client. Since then, Bodt has been an active member of the community and created the Bitcoin meetup event in Paris and participated to the creation of the first Bitcoin community in London. The entrepreneur firmly believes that Bitcoin will become the most important currency in the world:""The advantage of Bitcoin as a unit of account is that it allows [its users] to stock value without any risk from actions of others; whereas Euros which requires [people] to be confident in the financial and political European system, as well as in the European Central Bank. [...] I am convinced with Bitcoin's upcoming success, as well as its potential in becoming, in the future, the most important currency in the world.""CoinPlus recently joined Technoport, a state-owned technology-oriented business incubator based in Esch-Belval. Founded in June 2012, Technoport Ltd. is a merge between technology-oriented business incubator Technoport and business support infrastructures Ecostart 1 and 2. The company's main mission is to help entrepreneurs and teams to bridge their ideas to success. Its activity is split in 3 platforms: a business incubator, a coworking space and a fab lab.Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in Western Europe bordered by Belgium, Germany and France. Its economy is largely dependent on the banking, steel and industrial sectors. The country is often qualified as a financial Eldorado as it features a high-income market economy with low inflation and a high level of innovation.

They even caved to pressure and doubled the original comment period, which now runs until October 19th.If they were expecting a negative reaction from the Bitcoin community, they got it. But the Bitcoin community and related businesses might not be their primary concern.

They are in one of the few indusries that will likely have to deal with Bitcoin regulation one way or another, without being dependent on Bitcoin itself: regulatory compliance.So it would be prudent for us, as a bitcoin community, to pay attention to what they have to say.Showcasing their knowledge of constructive criticism 101, Strevus started by applauding the NYS DFS for taking the lead in Bitcoin regulation in the United States and for their stated goal of not impeding on the innovative aspects of Bitcoin technologies while preserving “national security.” But then jumped into what they think would be appropriate regulation on Bitcoin companies.“[DFS Bitcoin Regulations need to be] no more burdensome than New York’s Money Transmitter law nor the Federal AML laws. They should ensure such regulations preserve and protect those unique aspects of digital currency that aren’t susceptible to traditional regulatory efforts and offer an appropriate safe harbor to ensure the continued viability of the digital currency industry.”They then lay out specific areas where they think the DFS BitLicense regulation may be more stringent than current traditional financial regulations and how the regulation fails, in their mind, to consider the various innovations brought on by blockchain technologies.Strevus has three main points of contention where it thinks the BitLicense regulation is more burdensome than regulation put on traditional financial companies: CTR reporting, SAR obligations and “the nearly technically impossible obligation to require reporting on 'all parties to the transaction.' As we all know, the Bitcoin framework explicitly divorces itself from the identity of the parties to effectuate a bitcoin transaction.”Additionally, they contend that the proposed regulation is more burdensome on businesses than current Federal AML law, in particular its section on Enhanced Due Diligence reporting, which it says depends too heavily on the geography of parties involved.It is also argued in the paper that the regulation will be difficult or impossible to follow without taking away from the features that make the Bitcoin network unique and powerful.“It’s simply not possible to square the DFS objective to preserve and protect the unique characteristics of bitcoin with an obligation to report identities of all parties to a transaction in the currently open network that characterizes the bitcoin framework.”Strevus then goes on to explain a few modifications that could be made to the Bitlicense or used in replacement legislation, including the addition for regulatory safe-havens for new Bitcoin startups, something they say have been used to protect new industries in the past.When reached out for further comment, Strevus CEO and cofounder Ken Hoang gave us this:“In order to establish stability in the digital currency market, financial institutions need to engage in high-volume trading of the new asset. However, they won’t do that until there are regulations in place to protect their customers, their business and the industry.  North American regulatory activity around KYC and AML guidelines for digital currency may serve as the yardsticks that will influence global regulation.  This includes BitLicense (New York State’s Department of Financial Services), FinCEN (U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) and Bill C-31, a new Canadian law that is enforced by Canada's Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FinTRAC). It is important to note, that this may have a more powerful affect than a Bitcoin company saying the same thing. Strevus' business model is regulation compliance. While they would likely disagree publicly with this statement, companies like theirs gain something from increased regulation. If the world were an anarchist/libertarian dreamworld, there wouldn't be much of a market for them.However, even they can see what is clearly in front of everyone's face: the BitLicense proposal would decrease or eliminate Bitcoin businesses in the state. Some regulation might be good for Strevus' bottom line, but regulation that chokes out business all together doesn't help them or anyone else.Of course, any mention of regulation is likely to draw the ire of some in the bitcoin community. That said, this seems to be a sensible compromise. Regulation might not be preferable, but it is coming. Counter-proposals like Strevus' will be crucial in coming to an agreement both the community and government can live with.We asked Will Pangman, Chief Communications Officer at Tapeke, what his thoughts on Strevus' counter-proposal are:""In reading through [the Strevus comment], I'd surmise that if the middle-of-the-road approach to regulation is your thing, then this comment stands the best chance of effecting the NYDFS in that direction of any I've seen thus far.""Did you enjoy this article?

Bitcoin Derivatives Exchange TeraExchange Receives Approval From US Federal Regulator,Diana Ngo,9/13/2014 17:22,275,0,"Update Sept 18:The popular cryptocurrency exchangeHitBTC signed an agreemen with TeraExchange, a swap execution facility registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,  to provide an accurate and timed reference point for the first regulated platform for Bitcoin derivatives.According to the agreement, HitBTC’s trading data is included in the TeraExchange Bitcoin Price Index. The Tera Bitcoin Price Index employs a dynamic algorithm that compiles and filters data on a real-time basis from a number of widely utilized global Bitcoin exchanges. HitBTC executes and maintains the information sharing agreement with TeraExchange in order to be included in the index, as required by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“The structure of the Bitcoin swap marketplace reflects extensive client input, providing participants the benefits of transparent price discovery and efficient risk transfer.”                                                                                                                                 - Leonard T.

A robust price index also helps the growing Bitcoin trading community to accurately mark-to-market positions while establishing trust and stability in this growing global marketplace.”                                                                                                                             - Christian Martin                                                                                                                               CEO, Co-founder, TeraExchangePresently, both companies plan to extend cooperation and seek new opportunities to provide the best and most technologically advanced solutions for the benefit of their customers.---Original articleSwap execution facility TeraExchange announces it is now registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and becomes the first regulated platform for Bitcoin derivatives with a spot Bitcoin index.New-Jersey-based Bitcoin derivatives exchange TeraExchange announced on September 12, it has received the approval from US federal regulator CFTC for its Bitcoin derivatives platform, according to a press release. USD/Bitcoin swaps’ trading is now subject to the regulations of TeraExchange and the CFTC.TeraExchange's Bitcoin derivatives trading and hedging was first announced in March 2014 and the demand of a regulated product has considerably gained interest over time, especially from merchants, payment processors, miners and hedge funds, said the company.Co-founder and CEO Christian Martin told Reuters: ""For a merchant to take Bitcoin, there wasn't until this product a regulated way for them to put on a hedge to manage the risk... and now with this product they can.""- Christian Martin CEO TeraExchangeThe derivative offers an insurance against Bitcoin's price fluctuations by locking in a dollar value the Bitcoin holdings value. Investors can now list and trade dollar-denominated Bitcoin swaps, which are range from one day to two-year maturities. The swap is a bilateral contract requesting one counterparty to pay the other on its expiry, depending on whether the asset's price has exceeded or fallen behind the appointed threshold.Martin added that regulated derivatives trading would help smooth out Bitcoin's volatility and help the digital currency gain widespread acceptance as a currency and a payment method.According to president and co-founder Leonard Nuara, the new product is an important milestone for Bitcoin and will most certainly attract a broad landscape of investors interested in stepping in in the digital currency industry. The executive told CoinDesk:""This is a major step forward for the broader bitcoin community by building out a first institutional mechanism for hedging in the bitcoin space in a regulated marketplace. This is a step toward, potentially, reducing volatility and increasing liquidity in the marketplace because people will have more safety and soundness in their trading.""TeraExchange was launched as a SEF in October 2013. After its announcement in March 2014, it took the company over six months to get the Bitcoin swap and index past the US regulator. However, TeraExchange's Bitcoin swap contracts are still pending approval from the CFTC.Martin told the Wall Street Journal that the key to the CFTC's approval was TeraExchange's index, which was built based on an average of prices from six different Bitcoin exchanges around the globe. The CEO qualified it ""a true neutral arbiter of the Bitcoin price on a 24-hour basis that's not susceptible to manipulation.""Available since Friday, the exchange told Reuters 50 clients interested in the new product have already registered, and the company has already started receiving commitments from both markets makers and companies offering Bitcoin prices for buyers and sellers. Did you enjoy this article?

Interview with Stanislav Wolf,Felix Vögele,8/25/2014 16:14,123,0,"Stanislav Wolf is the initiator of the first Bitcoin conference in Germany. The Cologne native has connected to the local Bitcoin scene early and has promoted Bitcoin and its acceptance across the Rhineland metropolis.He has been busy with attending bussiness school at the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University as he is intensely focused on digital currencies and is considered one of the first users of the Bitcoin in Germany.Cointelegraph chatted with Stanislav Wolf about the upcoming Bitcoin Conference in Cologne, Bitcoin in Germany and the forthcoming regulation in New York City.Cointelegraph: In early September, the Bitcoin Conference will take place again in Cologne and you are one of the organizers. How did you get the idea for this project and what can be expected from this year’s conference?Stanislav Wolf: The Bitcoin Conference 2014 will be held in Cologne on September 2. We can look back on a little history. We started in April 2013 with a Meetup in Cologne and had up to fifty visitors at the monthly meetings.Then we decided to organize the first Bitcoin Conference in Germany in October last year. Well-known names from the German Bitcoin scene and 130 participants attended the event to exchange ideas and see exciting presentations.- Bitcoin Conference in Germany, October 2013This year it is [becoming] bigger and better of course. Because of the cooperation with the Pirate Summit, [we] can also offer side events next to the conference. Of particular note is the Pirate Camp, where in addition to Bitcoin, there will also be other startups with up to thousands of visitors.At the September 2nd conference, we will see German experts like Jörg Platzer and Aaron Koenig along with international speakers such as Alan Reiner, founder of Armory, and Talia Wolf, an expert in Conversion. Also projects outside the Bitcoin network such as Ethereum, Stellar or Koina have strong representation this year.CT: The announced regulation in New York has caused a lot of turmoil. While regulation could be a step in the right direction, what is your opinion on the previous points of the draft proposal? Will the Bitcoin conference participate in the discussion?SW: The regulation of Bitcoin is one of my personal favorite topics. A final assessment of the regulation in New York is not possible, in my opinion.The ongoing process leading to the final law, still continues. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that different lobby interests [have emerged]. But some details make it already clear that New York as location will become less innovative. These include longer retention periods of documents than comparable MSBs (Money Service Businesses) or the transfer of Bitcoin assets to the state by non-use for a longer time.The Bitcoin conference of course will deal with the issue of regulation. Here, our focus is more [...] on the situation in Europe. As part of a panel where Tanja Aschenbeck-Florange, Osborne Clark, Lutz Auffenberg, Winheller, and a representative of the Federal Bitcoin Association eV will participate. It will deal specifically with the states` possibilities of regulation.CT: You were one of the first Bitcoin users in Germany; so you've recognized its huge potential quite early. How do you see its past performance and how will Bitcoin fare in the future in Germany?SW: So far the development is extremely positive. When I was following the first Bitcoin bubble in 2011, I could never have guessed how far we can get. But it wasn`t the huge potential which surprised me. It always amazes me much more when I see how easily Bitcoin circumvents great risks. The regulatory control of Bitcoin, for example, by Prohibitions is only attempted in a few states and also on the technical side, there was a firm and [supportive] intervention of the community at every critical moment.In Germany, I see a lot of potential, but not as a form of payment. The financial system in Europe is well developed and a very large part of the population has access to banking services. As long as there is no killer app, which is available only with Bitcoin, nothing will change. As a store of value or an addition to [an] investment portfolio, Bitcoin is perfect. And even if the value of Bitcoin varies greatly every day, the upward growth was always greater than downward.CT: More and more larger companies from abroad such as Dell and Dish accept Bitcoin as payment. In Germany, acceptance by merchants is still missing. Also, many people do not know at all what Bitcoin is. How can you make Bitcoin in Germany more mainstream? Are there any plans for this at the Bitcoin Conference?SW: First, I would like to say that the success or acceptance of Bitcoin should not be equated with the knowledge of Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be successful without people [knowing Bitcoin it is]. You can already see this in the USA more or less.Organizations like Bitpay or Coinbase, marketed Bitcoin consistently as a currency-agnostic Payment Network [but] Bitcoin excels in terms of cost and speed. The next step is that startups like Circle or Coinapult offer mass-market Wallets. In this case, the dollar amount is brought to the foreground, which allows people without Bitcoin knowledge easy access. So the loop closes and the use of Bitcoin is possible without any knowledge.In Germany, the situation is more difficult, because the ATM card or the direct debit are much more competitive. Because of this, the incentive for retailer is significantly smaller, apart from the still not clarified sales tax. But the potential in our land is much bigger.The key points are transparency, decentralization, and democratization of the financial system. These points are under-represented in today's financial world and can be clearly explained in the example of Bitcoin. At the Bitcoin conference we will also talk with all interested parties and explain the idea behind Bitcoin.Link to the conference: bitcoin-konferenz.de/programm/Did you enjoy this article?

News. “I think it’s also a complete invasion of privacy.”We had a chance to speak with Lukasiewicz over the weekend about Coinsetter, regulations and New York City in general.Cointelegraph: Coinsetter is fully launched as of July 24. How have the last few weeks since leaving beta been for you?Jaron Lukasiewicz: This has been one of the most exciting times of my career now that Coinsetter has launched.We are seeing growth in active users and trading volume every week, and most importantly, our customers have expressed a very positive experience with our exchange.CT: Tell us about the journey to this point so far. You founded Coinsetter in late 2012, when one bitcoin was worth, what, 8 dollars?JL: Bitcoin was at $7 when I started the company. Anyone who was active in the space at that time will remember that things were very different back then. My friends laughed at me for starting a “trading platform for play money.” They’re definitely not laughing anymore, and we now offer a leading, institutional-class exchange in one of the most exciting parts of the tech industry.CT: The focus of the company has changed since those early days. What are some of the challenges to providing Bitcoin liquidity to merchants or ATMs that you did not foresee?JL: The international SWIFT wire network is the Bitcoin industry’s biggest pain point. Anyone sending funds through slow bank transfer networks will know about the working capital complexities it creates.CT: How do you feel about the NYDFS’s proposed regulations for so-called BitLicenses?JL: I hope that the final regulations put in place are in line with the capabilities of Bitcoin technology. We want to be able to fully comply with the regulations, and it was not possible to comply some of the proposed regulations from a technology perspective.CT: Pending regulation, of course, would you recommend New York as a destination for Bitcoin entrepreneurs?JL: Yes.

"The Chamber of Digital Commerce Wants You, To Educate Congress",Ian DeMartino,8/22/2014 15:18,191,0,"The BitLicense proposal appearing to be something so suffocating for Bitcoin businesses, many of them would rather not do business with the state. But rather than simply leave New York and hope that the policy doesn't become popular nationwide, the Digital Chamber of Commerce wants to enlist you to help them educate Congress on a more reasonable approach to Bitcoin regulation.While many in the community would argue that Bitcoin cannot be regulated by its very nature, others would point out that government attempts are coming either way and it would benefit the community to express what kind of attempts are reasonable and which are unenforceable or nurturer the technology.With that in mind, the Chamber of Digital Commerce is asking for volunteers that live near by or can travel to Washington D.C. and help educate legislators on appropriate legislation for digital currencies.photo credit: Bo47 via photopin ccThey are calling it “Bitcoin Education Day.” The event will take place on August 29th and will have an open comment period about the BitLicense proposal. The only qualification one has to have is a willingness to wear business attire and “conduct themselves with the highest level of professionalism” while having at least “a basic understanding of blockchain technology.”Participants will receive a certificate confirming their participation, signed by the president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.The event will begin at 9am and will finish at 7pm. It will consist of a briefing and coffee session, two sets of meetings with congressional members (split up by a lunch) a debriefing and a closing party.If you believe you would be a good candidate to help explain the admittedly complex world of cryptocurrencies, you can send an email to the Chamber of Digital Commerce through the form on their official site.Did you enjoy this article?

Bitcoin Foundation Releases a Primer on Jurisdictions for BTC Businesses,Armand Tanzarian,8/21/2014 16:23,233,0,"As mentioned in a recent piece regarding Coinbase having to police its users’ gambling activity, having to deal with the various regulations of multiple jurisdictions is a minefield, particularly for Bitcoin businesses, whose models are theoretically border-agnostic.Still, if a Bitcoin payments processor wants to attract customers in the US, it has to abide by relevant US laws, as court cases have demonstrated.And if it would rather avoid those headaches, then it has to come up with creative workarounds to disqualify it from US jurisdictions.That is the very basic summary of the Bitcoin Foundation’s “A Primer on Bitcoin Jurisdiction”, a document the foundation made freely available online Wednesday to help its members and other cryptocurrency startups tackle their legal obligations.The report was commissioned by Robert A. McFarlane, a partner at Hanson Bridgett LLP’s office in San Francisco, to show companies the steps they could take to avoid subjecting themselves to regulations or lawsuits in states that are not Bitcoin-friendly.“No Bitcoin business wants to exclude any jurisdiction,” Jim Harper, Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, said in a statement, “but it is important to have that option. When regulations are unjustified by consumer protection benefits, the better course will be to conduct business in the jurisdictions that embrace innovation, the consumer benefits of Bitcoin, economic growth, and job creation.”A few avoidance strategies include:This is important reading for anyone with a Bitcoin startup or a company that otherwise deals in cryptocurrencies or blockchain technologies that are not easily restricted by state boundaries, particularly one with US customers or a US office.Again, the primer can be found here.Did you enjoy this article?

U.S. Regulators are Slowing Pulling Bitcoin into the Existent Regulatory Framework,Matchpool,8/11/2014 14:00,254,0,"U.S. regulators are slowly rubbing Bitcoin into the existent regulatory framework. New York's 'BitLicense' draft, which recently made head waves for its heavy-handed approach, was yet another reminder that regulation is unavoidable.PaymentWeek, an information service for the emerging payments industry, hosted an enlightening webinar — regulatory experts discussed challenges of regulation and the future impact on cryptocurrencies. The panel included New York Law School professor Houman Shadab, financial services lawyer Carol Van Cleef, and Visa veteran and current BitPay chief compliance officer, Tim Byun.Here are some key points from the wide-ranging U.S. regulatory discussion:The panel discussed Bitcoin's complexity. As it can be used for a range of financial activities, it falls under the jurisdiction of a umpteen different alphabet soup agencies. For example, FinCEN oversees money laundering and terrorist financing concerns and the IRS treats Bitcoin as property for tax purposes.Regulators have yet to implement a standardized approach to complex financial instruments, like securities and derivatives. But they are taking steps; Shadab pointed out that the Security and Exchange Commission brought a suit against someone running bitcoin ponzi scheme even though the contract was denominated in bitcoin rather than dollars.Bitcoin exchanges need to jump some hoops to register as Money Service Businesses. But “existing banks probably would not need a special license,” said Van Cleef, if they choose to get involved in a cryptocurrency. “They would have a significant advantage because they already have the infrastructure in place,” she said.- Tim Byun, Chief Compliance Officer at BitPay, Inc.Byun discussed BitPay's role in this, stating:“We operate under an explicit exemption, which exempts merchant processors from being registered as a MSB.”The panelists agreed that while the BitLicense requirements were well-intentioned, they missed the mark. Criticism for New York's BitLicense has lingered on the effects on statewide Bitcoin startups, but Byun said attention has strayed from an important issue. “We are forgetting the population of New York, including the New York consumers” he noted.The speakers were in less agreement on how other states would respond to BitLicense's model. Shadab expects that while states won't exactly follow the details of the proposed BitLicence, they are likely to follow the “ask permission” approach of the licensing model.Byun claims that it is too early to say. Texas regulators issued guidance that was a much softer approach than New York. Van Cleef said it was important to consider differences in state power, “Not every state has as broad a mandate as the New York DFS does to come up with a new regulatory scheme for the world of currencies.”Interestingly, they discussed the prospect of a self-regulatory organization (SRO) stepping in as a substitute for government regulators.- Carol Van Cleef, Partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLPVan Cleef pointed out that the Digital Assets Transaction Authority has stepped up in this way. However she pointed out that venture capitalists are unlikely to invest in this:“The challenge is whether an SRO could be shaped fast enough to be able to come forward and assert a leadership role in respect to best regulatory practices.”- Houman B. Shadab, Professor of LawThe moderator asked what the panelists would do if they had blank slate to work with. Shadab mentioned an academic debate over the value of the U.S.'s financial laws. He went on to say:“It could make sense to make a universal exemption that applies to [...] virtual currencies, in recognition of the fact that they are unique in ways that we've discussed.”But he doesn't see that happening. Byun pointed out that regulators need to “leverage laws” already in place without being overburdensome.Van Cleef noted that regardless of the Bitcoiners' desire with respect to the regulatory framework, “it is important for the community to react to in a positive form and not a negative form, because [regulation] is not going to go away.”Legal Basics: Owning and Using Bitcoin in the United StatesLegal Basics: Owning and Using Bitcoin in EuropeLegal Basics: Bitcoin in ChinaBitcoin Legal Basics: Russia and AsiaLooking for the best applicant for your vacancy?

It’s a Network’Sound familiar? On Monday, Diana Ngo reported on Visa’s stance that cryptocurrencies were not being seen by the company as competitors but something that Visa’s payments network could facilitate.“Visa CEO Charles Scharf admitted to looking for a way to make payments frictionless as well as developing technologies that would enable easier and faster payments of its users. ‘Payment works best when it is a non-event, it works, it's fast and nothing goes wrong.’”2. Xapo Addresses Fees, Says It Will Offer ReimbursementsOn Thursday, Bogdan Ulm reported that Xapo had issued a statement regarding their fees, which had become a source of controversy among would-be users.“‘We do not, however, intend to charge monthly fees or fees for everyday spending,’ the company’s statement read. ‘If our users are charged a monthly service fee, Xapo will reimburse that amount in bitcoins. So, if you use the Xapo Debit Card and are charged a monthly service fee by our third party provider, we will directly reimburse your Xapo Wallet.’”3. UK Looking Into BTC to Build a Global Financial Tech HubOn Wednesday, we reported that Britain’s Chancellor of the Treasury, George Osborne, had initiated research to see whether Bitcoin could fit into the government’s strategy of making the UK a leader in FinTech.“‘It’s only by harnessing innovations in finance, alongside our existing world class knowledge and skills in financial services that we’ll ensure Britain’s financial sector continues to meet the diverse needs of businesses and consumers, here and around the globe, and create the jobs and growth we all want to see in the future,’ Osborne said. ‘Key to the government’s long-term economic plan is cementing Britain’s position as the center of global finance.’”4. Canada’s Cryptocurrency Regulations Will Likely Go Into Effect Next YearDiana Ngo reported on Monday that the Bitcoin Foundation Canada estimates the government’s financial regulations aimed at cryptocurrencies will only go into effect in 2015.“The Canadian financial regulator said that changes to the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorism Financing Act, a list of rules that facilitate combatting the laundering of proceeds of crime and combating the financing of terrorist activities, ‘will aim to cover entities such as virtual currency exchanges, not individuals or businesses that use virtual currencies for buying and selling goods and services.’”5. The French Senate Looks Into the Benefits of BitcoinOn Wednesday, Diana Ngo reported that the French senate’s financial committee issued a report on Bitcoin that was rather positive.“The document stated that the technology ‘can no longer be disregarded by public authorities,’ and, despite the risks, ‘Bitcoin offers multiple opportunities for the future, both as payment system and, above all, as a decentralized validation protocol,’ the report said.”Bitcoin’s exchange value with the dollar has jumped around erratically since it lost about 6.5% of its value during late July’s drop — but we’re still only talking about activity within a range between about US$580 and $US600.Tuesday saw a price drop (from about US$594 to US$580) that spurred a midweek spike in the number of transactions per day and the transaction volume.Last weekend’s price jump to above the US$600 mark also correlated to the highest two-day trading volume we’ve seen in more than a month, with daily transactions worth around US$7 million.

Bank of Namibia Rejects Bitcoin Exchanges on Basis of 50-Year-Old Law,Guest Author,9/17/2017 14:40,28633,401,"Namibia’s central bank, Bank of Namibia, has claimed that virtual currency exchanges have no place in the African country, under its decades-old law. The central bank also announced that merchants in the country may not accept cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, as payment for goods and services.In its latest position paper as of mid-September 2017, the Bank of Namibia explained that Bitcoin and other digital currencies present only a “minimal” threat to its monetary policymaking role. However, it claimed that the cryptocurrencies are not authorized in the country under the Exchange Control Act of 1966.Part of the position paper reads:""In addition to the bank not recognizing virtual currencies as legal tender in Namibia, it also does not recognize it to be a foreign currency that can be exchanged for local currency. This is because virtual currencies are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity.""The Bank of Namibia mainly cited previous reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in its position paper. Among the familiar points that it raised, are the possible use of digital currencies on money laundering activities, the perceived shortcomings of a currency without support by a government or a commodity, and the potential benefits of the cryptocurrencies’ underlying distributed ledger technology, or Blockchain technology to the financial system.The central bank reiterated that it cannot endorse any activity involving virtual currencies, despite their ability to facilitate remittances and other consumer payments due to the lack of a legal premise.""Virtual currencies cannot be used to pay for goods and services in Namibia. For example, a local shop is not allowed to price or accept virtual currencies in exchange for goods and services. Users of virtual currencies should, therefore, exercise caution when dealing in this type of currencies or when comparing it to e-money.”In Africa, it is Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa that are the pioneers of cryptocurrency, but as the world of Bitcoin spreads, places like Tanzania are starting to show growth.Jennifer Keith is an entrepreneur and advocate for diversity and equality.

China's Stricter Bitcoin Regulations Will Strengthen Hong Kong Market,Joseph Young,9/16/2017 14:15,18763,792,"On September 15, the Chinese government and local financial regulators officially requested Chinese exchanges and trading platforms to shut down by the end of September. OKCoin and Huobi, the two largest exchanges in China, were granted leeway to operate until the end of October.Rather strangely, bitcoin price rebounded from $2,900 to $3,600 as the Chinese government and local exchanges confirmed the nationwide suspension of exchanges. Many analysts explained that traders were looking to purchase the dip, which justifies the abrupt $800 increase in bitcoin price within a 24-hour period.Many investors, traders and analysts still remain optimistic in regard to China’s ban on exchanges because throughout 2017, the Chinese bitcoin exchange market only accounted for approximately 10 to 13 percent of global bitcoin trades.More to that, in an interview with the South China Morning Post, Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong Leonhard Weese noted that China’s restrictions on bitcoin trading and usage will drive businesses to Hong Kong and nearby countries like Japan and South Korea.Weese told South China Morning Post:“People in China will be more careful about marketing these events, and a lot of that marketing activity will come to Hong Kong in the form of conferences and communities,”.Since early 2015, Hong Kong has been praised for being a regulatory friendly region for bitcoin and blockchain startups. Still, unlike China, South Korea and Japan, Hong Kong’s bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange markets have struggled to demonstrate exponential growth. For the past three years, only 1 Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex was able to evolve into a major global bitcoin trading platform.But, Weese emphasized that if China continues to crackdown on bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related businesses, it will further drive growth to Hong Kong.It is important to acknowledge that leading bitcoin exchanges like OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC, the three largest exchanges in China, were unfairly punished for their cooperation with the government.Over the past 12 months, the entire Chinese bitcoin industry has closely collaborated with local authorities in order to establish transparent industry standards and to improve the Chinese bitcoin exchange market.Instead, they were ultimately shut down by the powers, despite having allocated massive amounts of capital and resources to comply with the demands of the Chinese government.Chinese #bitcoin exchanges worked with the government, allocating substantial resources to improve the market & they were punished instead. pic.twitter.com/5DhByT5SSIIt is difficult to imagine that startups with limited capital and even large-scale bitcoin companies will be willing to undergo the same path Chinese bitcoin exchanges have taken just to be shut down and terminated by the authorities.In the upcoming months, as BTCC, OKCoin, Huobi and other bitcoin exchanges continue to expand their international services, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan will likely experience rapid growth in terms of bitcoin users, trading activity and conferences.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Hong Kong    #Markets    #Government    #Bitcoin Price    #Bitfinex    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Investments  
India’s RBI Moves Towards Providing Digital Currencies Legal Tender Status,Joshua Althauser,9/16/2017 12:51,19081,406,"The Indian central bank Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has established a task force that will assess the possible granting of legal tender status to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The central bank is also eyeing to draft a cryptocurrency regulation in the near future. The central bank is also considering digitizing rupee, with an outright dislike for Bitcoin.This move by the RBI is expected to make India as one of the hottest countries for digital currencies in the near future. However, there is no clear plan of action yet on how the central bank will approach the regulation of the virtual currencies.A number of governments around the world are currently having a hard time in making an appropriate definition for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. This is due to the very unique form of this new type of money.To deal with it, some governments are implementing strict regulations to handle it and as a form of a very cautious approach. Other countries are just allowing the use of the cryptocurrencies without any regulation as this could create more confusion to everyday consumers.Despite the negative stance shown by the Indian government to digital currencies in the past, the move by the RBI showed that the government is adopting an open-minded approach toward regulating the cryptocurrencies. Any decision that will be made by the central bank in the near future is expected to have a major effect on how Bitcoin and other virtual currencies will be accepted in the country.Many financial industry players expect that the RBI will decide positively on regulating the virtual currencies. However, the central bank is also expected to impose some restrictions on the use of the cryptocurrencies. These expectations are premised on the fact that India stands to benefit substantially if it decides to adopt the various digital currencies.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Reserve Bank of India    #Digital Currency    #Government  
North Korea May Sidestep UN Sanctions with Bitcoin: Opinion,Chrisjan Pauw,9/15/2017 14:50,17214,227,"The latest round of sanctions imposed on North Korea by the UN is aimed at targeting some of the country’s biggest external revenue streams.A complete ban on all textiles from North Korea could cost the regime close to a billion dollars and some insiders say North Koreans are already feeling the squeeze as a result of earlier sanctions.Image: NBS NewsWith bans restricting the flow of money, the country is turning to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund their programs, instead of bowing down to pressure.It is reported that Kim Jong UN’s regime is targeting South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, with at least three confirmed successful attacks.Naeem Aslam, a CNBC, Bloomberg and Forbes commentator, says:“The country has stepped up the efforts in securing more Bitcoins along with many other cryptocurrencies. North Korea has an army of hackers who are constantly targeting South Korea, the hectic trading hub for cryptocurrency. The strategy would aid the country in bypassing many trade restrictions which also include the new sanctions.”With North Korea not looking to halt their nuclear testing program anytime soon, the US is bound to push for even tighter and more restrictive UN sanctions. This could force Kim Jong UN’s already desperate regime to intensify their hacking efforts.At the moment, there’s no evidence of North Korean attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges outside of South Korea. If some cases do eventually emerge, it won’t come as no surprise though, as the country might look further afield to claw its way out of its cash strapped isolation.If this is, in fact, Kim Jong UN’s intention, it might be a dangerous strategy given the current price volatility of digital coins.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #North Korea    #United Nations    #CNBC    #South Korea  
Big Banks Want to Destroy Bitcoin Before it Destroys Them,Darryn Pollock,9/15/2017 14:20,36206,1820,"It seems as if the talk of “the people’s currency” has started to sting the ears of those who traditionally have a monopoly of money, banks and governments.Recent negative statements by big banks, and governmental crackdown on digital currencies and ICOs can be seen as fightbacks by these institutions to the growing popularity of Bitcoin.Bitcoin always has had the potential to be a new currency free of control by big banks and governments, but as adoption has spread, the threat has become real.It should not be seen as surprising that banks, such as JP Morgan, are spilling vitriol and rhetoric about Bitcoin being a ‘fraud’ Bitcoin reaching mass adoption and succeeding spells the end for big banks and traditional financial institutions.The same goes for governments. A decentralized currency takes a huge amount of power out of the hands of the government who look to keep tabs on currency within their borders. Taxes and regulations of money is a powerful tool for governments.There has even been talk about how Bitcoin is the most crowded trade, indicating that traditional trading is clearly taking a hit.With a successful digital currency, big governments will lose seigniorage income—the benefits derived from printing money, and they will lose the ability to control the economy.For the banking sector, losing the ability to handle the money that flows between central banks and the economy is at the core of the banking business and the very existence of the monetary economy.These fears may well be a little too strong although Bitcoin flies in the face of a traditional monetary economy, and it is a decentralized system, there is an understanding that it can be supplementary rather than an undermining technology.Apostolos Pittas, adjunct professor of economics at LIU Post, has said:“Digital currency, as is the case with Bitcoin, helps to smooth the lending process. Recall what happened in 2007-2008 during the financial crisis. Credit dried up as banks stopped lending, and the markets froze. With a digital currency like Bitcoin, lending is decentralized, or peer to peer, and as a result, lending may continue, allowing money to reach those who need it.""",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #JPMorgan    #China    #Banks

"In Wake of China ICO Ban, Japan, Singapore, US Give Crypto Second Look",Chrisjan Pauw,9/15/2017 12:45,41155,315,"Some of the world’s leading economies are taking a fresh peek into how the cryptocurrency market should be regulated in their respective regions.Rather than banning ICOs outright like in China, these countries’ monetary authorities and regulators are looking to how to control, but not completely stifle, the growth in digital currencies.The headache for many agencies though is to figure out what would be the correct way of doing this. Due to the alternative nature of crypto coins, many regulators struggle to class it under the same policies as traditional investment assets.Japan is set to introduce more rigorous oversight on cryptocurrency exchanges in October this year, but regulators are still coming up with ways to do this efficiently without killing the growth of the industry.Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is looking at how to handle ICO’s to reduce money laundering and fraud. This includes establishing specific accounting rules on how to treat cryptocurrency transactions.Meanwhile MAS, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in a memo in August that it intends to regulate the sale of cryptocurrencies if it relates to products under their securities regulation. Their main concern is the potential for money laundering and terrorist financing through the ICO process.The memo states:“ICOs are vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks due to the anonymous nature of the transactions, and the ease with which large sums of monies may be raised in a short period of time.”Similarly, guidelines on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website urge buyers of digital tokens to be vigilant and provide them with ways of identifying investment schemes that could be used for nefarious purposes.Most regulators realize that there’s no real benefit to completely ban cryptocurrencies due to the economic advantages that it holds, nor is it possible. They will have to shut down the Internet. Instead, what they are looking to do is to focus on an area where they can exercise some form of control. And this area seems to be where digital coins meet fiat currencies, i.e. cryptocurrency exchanges.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #China    #Banned Bitcoin    #Japan    #Singapore    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies  
Breaking: “All” Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Must Close By September 30,William Suberg,9/15/2017 9:50,95588,2757,"“All” Chinese virtual currency exchanges must stop trading to remain compliant, regulators have announced.Information slowly appearing from China appears to confirm that trading will no longer be legal for Bitcoin-to-fiat platforms.Beijing market regulator requires all virtual currency exchanges (ie. OKcoin and Huobi) to stop trading by end of today.Bitcoin prices are already reacting, with 24-hour losses approaching 21% at $3000.Cryptocurrency CEOs have reacted to BTCChina and now other exchanges shutting down with firm plans for the future.Speaking in emailed comments, several industry players said that while markets were reacting harshly to Chinese regulatory moves, the long-term benefits for Bitcoin’s ethos and therefore stability were clear.“The price is always a solid metric of the markets’ greed and fear, and reflects regulatory uncertainty at the moment,” Leverj CEO Bharath Rao commented.“This also signals that development of non-custodial and decentralized models will accelerate.”“Regulation is neither necessary nor possible for decentralized models, and the future may have gotten just a bit brighter by nudging the crypto community to develop high speed, non-custodial exchanges.”Chinese investors became notorious for their short-term trading activities, which often influenced Bitcoin volatility in the past. The latest regulatory warnings produced a second mass exodus to p2p trading platforms such as Localbitcoins this year.With sanctioned Bitcoin-to-fiat trading looking to stop in China altogether, an major market influence will disappear, but this may not be the case forever.“China is practically building a cottage industry for mining and exchanging bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so it is hard to believe that they intend to exit a market with so much potential upside,” Jason English of Blockchain alliance Sweetbridge continued.“Even the apparent ban on ICOs seemed to be more of a stopgap in order to get some policies in place. If anything, this example shows the volatility of the space and that some market-makers can likely take advantage of an unclear news cycle to create a sell-off and buy back opportunity.”",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Exchanges  
Russia Central Bank Categorically Against Regulating Crypto as Money,William Suberg,9/14/2017 14:45,54081,260,"Russia central bank head Elvira Nabiullina has said it is “categorically against” regulating cryptocurrency money, or equating it with foreign currency.Speaking at a forum organized by a group of Russian banks, Nabiullina, who previously said she is against cryptocurrency appearing on the Moscow Stock Exchange, warned about so-called “cryptomania” occurring, which was “dangerous.”“We are categorically against regulating cryptocurrencies as money, as a means by which payment can be made for goods and services, and against equating them with foreign currency,” she stated via RIA Novosti.“Because, as I’ve said more than once before, we understand there’s foreign currency, states which issue it, economics, central banks supporting it. Here the phenomenon (of cryptocurrency) is less understood.”Russia continues to present a mixed perspective on how to regulate cryptoassets, with different prominent government sources giving contrasting views.At the forum, the situation appeared no different. Nabiullina commented that the central bank’s position was “tougher” than that held by the chairman of the organizing banking association, Anatoly Aksakov.Speaking earlier at the event, Aksakov said he favored “legalizing, arriving at a definition of what cryptocurrency is, arranging a space in which it should be allowed to trade, introducing a register for miners etc.”Nabiullina, for her part, made reference to a crypto “gold rush” earlier this month, which she said should be averted.Russia currently plans to present cryptocurrency regulation plans by the end of 2017.

How Industry Responded to China’s ICO Ban,Iyke Aru,9/13/2017 20:00,19471,413,"The Chinese regulators have banned the execution of ICOs within its borders, while this has altered the activities of a number of blockchain companies, others have continued with their original plans, insisting that such a development is only but a temporary setback that will lead to a more sanitized industry.Anthony Diioro, CEO and Founder at Jaxx describes the trending ban out of China as nothing more then a slight ""hiccup"" for the rapidly growing global decentralized technology ecosystem.Diiorio notes that any attempts to quash the flow of value between individuals, to attempt to restrict the freedom of individuals in this ever increasingly connected world will be unsuccessful in the long term.He says:“Information wants to run free, be free, and ""value"" is information, 1's and 0's. Countries and government whose goals are to restrict the flow of value, to keep it within their borders, will be missing out on crucial opportunities. They will miss out on the opportunities to develop new emerging sectors and to discover new ways to create true value in the world.”He concludes by noting that over time countries and governments that direct themselves based on ""fears"" will do those within their borders a great disservice.One of the longest running digital currency service providers in Europe, Cryptopay is continuing with its plan slated for later this year.Cryptopay has been in operation since 2013, providing a seamless exchange between crypto and conventional assets to the crypto community.George Basiladze, CEO of Cryptopay, tells Cointelegraph that his company is looking beyond the present circumstances surrounding the crypto ecosystem.He notes that the current ban from China is a temporary setback that should not distract the industry from their long term focus.Basiladze says:“The future is very bright when it comes to payments and financial services overall. For decades we have been working with legacy antiquated systems and have come to a point now where it's not efficient to continue. Blockchain has come along to unravel the complexity built up over the years and provide a truly secure, immutable, and scalable infrastructure, which has never been achieved.”Valentin Preobrazhenskiy, CEO at LAToken, explains that his company has responded to the development by putting all of its activities related to China on hold:“We were about to participate in Blockchain conferences and meetups there, but cancelled our roadshow in mainland China. We also don’t accept contributions from Chinese citizens and residents at the moment. However, the Chinese ban doesn’t affect our activities in other countries, and we still proceed with our token sale as scheduled.”Preobrazhenskiy acknowledges the negative sentiment created by the development in China as is evident in the market behaviour. Bitcoin price quickly bounced, while Ethereum, the most popular currency for ICOs, is still in a holding pattern as markets worry that other operations with cryptocurrencies may be banned by Chinese regulators as well.Another anxiety trigger comes with the fears, that other regulators might follow Chinese ruling and ban token sales instead of regulating.Preobrazhenskiy notes that along with cancelling all the activities related to China, his company has introduced a representation form, that stops Chinese investors from investing in the aftermath of the ban.Expressing his opinion towards the development, Tone Vays, Blockchain Consultant and Researcher, tells Cointelegraph that it is looking more likely that while China has banned ICOs, they are going to demand licensing from those running Bitcoin exchange.Vays explains that the development is not expected to have a great affect on Bitcoin in the long run but that the ICO ban would put heavy pressure on Ethereum:“I think more countries would follow in China's footprints when it comes to banning ICO because they are an unregulated form of funding and most countries have laws to prevent this.  “Unfortunately for Ethereum it has no other use case than to be a platform for those ICO's.”The level of confidence exhibited by some of these organizations may be connected with how Bitcoin and the general crypto market have reacted previously in the wake of assumed setbacks.Simon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com says:“One country’s ban will be another country’s opportunity, we saw this first hand when Japan took the Bitcoin market from China after PBOC last intervention. We saw that PBOC came back with a supportive approach after watching Bitcoin impact in Japan and I expect the same with ICO's.”However, Dixon notes that this ban is rather a much needed cooling down of a bubble that was getting overheated and needed to return to real fundamental value. He also believes that the Chinese government will eventually review the policy once they have time to digest how to handle ICO's in the future.This is similar to the sentiments upheld by Blockchain Consultant Kaushik Ghosh who believes that no government can actually put a bar on the development of blockchain based applications. Ghosh expects these bans to be eventually lifted and replaced with regulatory measures to control the scams which are also quite popular.The fact that governments and regulatory bodies are becoming concerned about happenings around the crypto ecosystem can be analysed from two different perspectives.One perspective is that the government is acting as an advisory body to its citizens, attempting to protect them from unhealthy projects, and the second perspective being that the government is becoming more interested in the happenings within the crypto ecosystem. The latter is a good sign for crypto advocates when considering the subject of adoption.Mark Morris, Founder at token.farm, believes that the Chinese government crackdown on cryptocurrency is a positive sign for the monetary trend to adopt cryptocurrency as a replacement for fiat. He claims that the movement is alive, strong, and a threat to the old guard.Morris notes that this can be compared to specific countries where citizens are incentivized to move wealth to other sovereign entities to protect it, saying that nothing else is new this time except for the vehicle which is now cryptocurrency via blockchain protocols.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Government    #George Basiladze    #Tone Vays    #Simon Dixon  
"Crypto Market Maturing, Not Stalling",Darryn Pollock,9/13/2017 9:50,18678,312,"This year has seen the cryptocurrency market cross 800 percent growth, but recently, there has been a slowing down and leveling off, even a dip. Is this the market stalling after astronomical growth, or could it be a sign of maturation?Governments, financial institutions, as well as new niches of the population, are no longer observing cryptocurrencies - they are taking part. However, the flipside is that there’s been a lot of interference in places like China, with their ICO ban, as well as the USA and its SEC, and FINRA and the Russian central bank.There is no denying the astronomical growth of the crypto market, but for some these are scary signs, and signs that an unprecedented bubble is forming.However, interesting developments are indicative that the landscape might in fact be evolving into a more stabilized market.Fears of regulation and China jumping in with its hardline approach to ICOs, look to be actively stalling the market, but these can be viewed as signs of maturity.Regulations for a decentralised platform like Bitcoin et al seem oxymoronic, however, some regulation can be a good thing, as it can stabilize the chaotic landscape that is digital currencies.In tandem, startups and projects are emerging to help the market adapt to the new rules, letting them fit into the current markets while still allowing them to be disruptive and revolutionary.It has already been stated, but the fact that traditional money, and investors, as well as governments, are getting involved with digital currencies proves that there is indeed a new and steady step being made.Of course, some of the signs that are being interpreted as a maturing market can also be viewed as a stalling market.The astronomical growth has literally scared some investors, as they cannot see how it can continue to expand without a dreaded pop. This has seen more cautious investors slow their fury and ease off a bit, leading to a stalling of sorts.The ICO ban in China is also a big move as governments are still looking for precedents as to how to handle this new technology. Banning ICOs means that the new market of innovators with Blockchain technology and digital currencies are cut out, and again, the market stalls.Finally, it is not just China and its bold ban. Other countries, like the USA and its SEC have shown they are skeptical of ICOs, and as such, Russian and the FINRA have followed suit.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Markets    #Cryptocurrencies    #China    #ICO    #Government    #USA    #SEC    #Russia  
UK Regulator Delivers Modest Caution On ‘Very High-Risk’ ICOs,William Suberg,9/13/2017 8:10,11761,295,"The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has released new guidance on ICOs, urging consumers to be “conscious of the risks.”In one of the more moderate responses to the growing investment phenomenon, the FCA refrained from any suggestion that specific schemes may face legal difficulties.Certain businesses may be “conducting regulated activities” as part of their ICO, but this would be decided on a “case by case basis.”“Many ICOs will fall outside the regulated space,” a bulletin on the Authority’s website reads.“However, depending on how they are structured, some ICOs may involve regulated investments, and firms involved in an ICO may be conducting regulated activities.”In holding off on blanket legislation for token sales, the FCA follows the example of the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), which also advised it would consider each ICO scheme on its own merits.Hong Kong has also followed suit in this respect, while markets continue to feel the pressure of China’s all-out ban on ICOs enacted last week.In the West, Canada most recently caused a stir when a planned $125 mln ICO from social media platform Kik, opted to exclude its citizens due to legal uncertainties.In turn, the FCA highlighted six “risks” which served to make ICOs “very high-risk, speculative investments.”“You are extremely unlikely to have access to UK regulatory protections like the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service,” the bulletin explained about the level of investor protection offered in the UK for victims of fraudulent schemes.The Authority also encouraged consumers to report “scam” ICOs directly.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #United Kingdom    #ICO    #USA    #SEC    #Hong Kong    #Canada  
Can North Korea’s Bitcoin Links Be Used to Justify Chinese Bitcoin Ban?,William Suberg,9/12/2017 12:30,11859,227,"North Korea is stepping up cryptocurrency attacks as some suggest the country’s threat could form a basis for China to restrict Bitcoin.As Bloomberg reports Monday, hackers from Kim Jong Un’s regime have increasingly targeted South Korean exchanges, compromising servers and gaining control of a cryptocurrency media outlet.“We definitely see sanctions being a big lever driving this sort of activity,” Luke McNamara, a researcher at research firm FireEye who revealed the trend told the publication.“They probably see it as a very low-cost solution to bring in hard cash.”South Korea has risen to become a huge trading force in Bitcoin and altcoins this year, while at the same time authorities appear to be following China in threatening punishments for ICO-related activities.China’s ICO lockdown is rumored to soon spread to Bitcoin-to-fiat exchanges, which for already critical mainstream media could lead to suggestions authorities will seek to villainize Bitcoin as justification.North Korea would provide a convenient scapegoat in this instance, while a full ‘ban on Bitcoin’ from China has been dismissed as impossible throughout the industry.As far back as last year, Andreas Antonopoulos added to the idea of Bitcoin’s fundamental role in China, stating that mining alone was so ingrained into official corruption that no party had an interest in shutting the practice down.“The ability to effect change on the ground is mediated by layers and layers of bureaucracy... and the bigger the crisis the easier they are to corrupt,” he commented discussing the likelihood of China exerting a full ban on Bitcoin.Reeve Collins, Tether co-founder and CEO of BLOCKv, meanwhile told Cointelegraph today that the country’s regulatory approach to ICOs will ultimately strengthen all parties.“China's ban is a bellwether for the need for more regulation in the market which we believe will aid the market by helping to ensure only legitimate companies sell tokens. It doesn't change our strategy for a token sale,” he said.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #North Korea    #China    #Bloomberg    #ICO    #Andreas Antonopoulos  
"Is China Really Banning Bitcoin Exchanges, Or is it Fake News?",Darryn Pollock,9/12/2017 10:55,45824,514,"Amid a swirl of speculation and assumptions, mainstream media outlets in the West are reporting that China will indeed be banning Bitcoin exchanges.This comes after the Chinese government placed a blanket ban on ICOs earlier.The reports in publications like the Wall Street Journal and others are quoting ‘anonymous’ sources that were not providing too much detail.According to the Wall Street Journal, and their unverified and anonymous sources, the regulators were not even sending clear messages on the details of the ban - such as when it would occur.Apparently, one regulator told an exchange that the decision had already been made, while another said that it could take a few months.""Despite the foggy nature of these proclamations, the Bitcoin price has taken a second dip after recovering from the news of the ICO ban in China.""Bloomberg also reports on the claims about exchange bans but says:“The ban will only apply to trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private.”Bitcoin has been a major disruptor in China and its socialist monetary policies.As such, it is believed that the Chinese government has perceived the growing interest of the digital currency as a threat especially as Chinese investors have been seen to buy up Bitcoin and bet against the yuan.The anonymous source cites “too much disorder” as the reason for the alleged shutdown, echoing the Chinese central bank’s words last week criticizing ICOs for disrupting the country’s financial order.Many hardline beliefs in Bitcoin are rightly skeptical about the perceived ban from China as there has been no official word, and no one brave enough to put their name on the news.CEO and founder of Chinese exchange BTCC has put up a twitter poll asking if people believe that the ban is real with over 80 percent of people saying no.#China regulators have finally decided to officially #ban all #Bitcoin exchanges & trading platforms. #True? or #FakeNews?Please #Retweet?OKCoin responded to this news saying:“‘Till now we haven't been informed by any authorities about closing BTC exchanges, if that happens, we will show notifications on our website in no time.

What Risks Investors and Authorities See in ICOs,Darryn Pollock,9/11/2017 16:50,15564,305,"While Bitcoin has been booming, so have ICOs, possibly on an even bigger scale. However, the ability to seemingly make money out of nothing has raised the hackles on a few key authorities, and also made a few investors think twice.ICOs come with a brand new, never before seen, set of risks and considerations and because of the nature of them, the authorities and the investor should proceed with caution.Bitcoin and some of the more established cryptocurrencies continue to - for the most part - walk hand in hand with governments and regulatory bodies as they look to find a middle ground. However, the spin off from this has been the mass creation of ICOs.The difference between an ICO and something like Bitcoin essentially rests in time and trust as the original digital currency has had time to prove it is not a scam and is operating for the right reasons.A rather large and important risk to consider, especially for investors, is the threat of fake cryptocurrencies, or scam ICOs. China, speaking of the country leading the crackdown, has a number of recent investment scams, such as Fanya Metal Exchange, Ezubao and Shanxinhui.As such, there is a big emphasis on protecting users from scam ICOs, which are not hard to manufacture, and succeed with, given the frenzy surrounding the ‘search for the next Bitcoin.’Of course, another big risk is that there is no threshold, standard or regulation surrounding ICOs. Bitcoin has only just started seeing regulation, which is strengthening its resolve within states, and that has been near on 10 years in the making.With ICOs popping up almost weekly, and across the globe, it is nearly impossible for regulators to control or indeed, even standardize the potential investment - or in other words, legitimize it somewhat.With this difficulty in regulating ICOs comes a difficulty in identifying illegal practices carried out in them.Different facets of ICOs can flirt with the line of the law, but because there is no regulation, no standard, there is not much room for authorities to stamp the law on ICOs.Additionally, the global scale of ICOs and the availability to those all across the globe mean that certain factors of an ICO may well be illegal in the country of a user investing into the ICO - even if it is legal in its country of origin.This again puts regulators and judiciaries in a difficult place in policing them.Being a virtual good to start with, it is hard to keep tabs on records of transactions. However, with free rein, it becomes even harder as there is little to no track record for virtual goods and transactions.And, even with the immutable ledger that most of these ICOs are based on providing a new age record, there are facets of anonymity that can lead to money laundering.This point may be a little controversial as it is essentially authorities and regulators shunning changes in an established social order, in other words, fighting against disruptive technology. But again, the extent of this disruption can verge on the illegal, and it can also break down norms in society that authorities hold dear.Institutions that have been set up to protect and serve the citizens, such as the IRS and SEC in the US, have found it difficult to gain control in the digital currency market thus far, and the addition of hundreds of ICOs makes it even more frustrating.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Investments    #ICO    #Government    #Markets    #Transactions    #Money Laundering    #IRS    #SEC  
UK’s Financial Regulator Releases Guidelines For Dealing In Crypto Derivatives,Marie Huillet,5/19/2018 0:35,18486,250,"The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published a statement requiring businesses to seek authorization for dealing in cryptocurrency derivatives on its website Friday, April 6.The statement clarifies that trading, transacting and advising on cryptocurrency derivatives is an activity which falls under the “Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID 2),” which was introduced as a part of the EU’s Jan. 2018 financial reforms.The FCA stipulates that although cryptocurrencies are not considered currencies or commodities that require regulation, derivatives referring to cryptocurrencies or ICO tokens are capable of being “financial instruments,” and thus fall within its regulatory perimeter.The FCA includes 3 examples of crypto derivatives: futures, contracts for differences (CFDs), and options.CFDs based on crypto-assets track the price of the underlying asset and allow investors to borrow money for their bets in order to chase high leverage returns. Importantly, they do not need to own any of the cryptocurrency itself.In late March the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) strengthened requirements for crypto-backed CFDs, citing the high price volatility of cryptocurrencies as its main concern.The FCA’s position echoes that of another European regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), earlier this year, which likewise sought to clarify the definition of derivatives after online crypto trading platforms began offering binary options, CFDs, and Forex contracts.Beyond Europe, Bitcoin futures are a popular derivative making inroads into the world of regulated finance, with banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs both clearing futures contracts for some clients after their launch on derivatives exchanges CME Group (Dec. 2017) and CBOE (Jan. 2018).",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #UK    #EU    #Markets    #Cryptocurrencies  
SEC Files Complaint Against Crypto-Affiliated Longfin For Insider Trading,Marie Huillet,4/6/2018 21:24,15081,179,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged trade finance group LongFin Corp. and its CEO, Venkata Meenavalli, with securities fraud, and frozen over $27 mln raised in “illicit trading profits,” according to an SEC Press Release published today, April 6.The SEC filed its lawsuit in the federal court of Manhattan, accusing Meenavalli of insider trading for selling “over two million unregistered, restricted shares” to Amro Altahawi, as well as “tens of thousands of restricted shares” to Dorababu Penumarthi and Suresh Tammineedi.The defendants are being charged with subsequently selling these shares to the public while the stock price was “highly elevated” due to Longfin’s publicized acquisition of “purported” crypto business Ziddu.com. Longfin’s post-acquisition market cap soared to over $3 bln, the SEC reports.The SEC is seeking penalties and disgorgement of “ill-gotten” profits under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. “We acted quickly to prevent … the profits being transferred out of the country,” remarked Robert Cohen, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit.  Longfin had been mired in controversy well before news of the SEC suit broke. The company was expelled from the Russell 2000 and 3000 indices in late March, with onlookers tweeting that the company was a “a pure stock scheme.”“I’m not going to sell [for] three years,” Meenavalli protested on CNBC’s Fast Money earlier this week. Eye-popping volatility in its share price saw stocks peak at $71.10 on March 23, before crashing to $9.13 by early April.On April 6, Nasdaq halted trading in Longfin shares at 10.01 AM (EDT).  Nasdaq’s action preceded the SEC announcement.Companies affiliating themselves with Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are coming under particular scrutiny recently, as regulatory frameworks take shape across the globe.

Japanese Financial Regulator Temporarily Halts Activities Of Two Crypto Exchanges,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/6/2018 14:58,15496,176,"Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has ordered the suspension of two more cryptocurrency exchanges and sent a business improvement notice to another, following a series of inspections after the January hack of around $534 mln in NEM from Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck, local news outlet Nikkei Asian Review reports today, April 6.As a result of the FSA’s on-site inspections of Japan’s 15 as-of-yet unregistered crypto exchanges, the regulator has already halted operations at two exchanges and sent business improvement notices to seven, including Coincheck.The Nikkei Asian Review notes that crypto exchange Last Roots received the latest business improvement notice, and the latest FSA orders to suspend operations are to crypto exchange External Link, which must pause operations on April 6 for two months, and FSHO, whose halting order must begin on the April 8.

Big Tech Are Banning Crypto And ICO Ads - Is There A Reason to Panic?,Stephen O'Neal,4/5/2018 18:54,19342,233,"Major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have recently banned advertising for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), whilst Google will introduce similar regulations in June 2018. Facebook came first saying that such ads are related to ‘deceptive promotional practices’ and setting a precedent for other social media giants that have taken similar action towards crypto and ICO-related advertising.The blanket bans have certainly done some damage to the market. Not only has it deprived industry players of certain promotional tools, but also contributed to the stigmatization of cryptocurrencies as a whole. However, there’s always a bright side: some experts argue that the crackdown might actually lead to legitimization of the industry.On Jan. 30 Facebook issued a blog post announcing that it will prohibit ads that use “misleading or deceptive promotional practices,” referring specifically to ICOs and cryptocurrencies. Rob Leathern, Product Management Director at Facebook, explained:“We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”The ban was “intentionally broad”, meaning that the social media giant decided to ban all cryptocurrency ads on its platforms (Facebook, Instagram and Audience networks) first, and then find out how to pick out ones that are actually “deceptive”. Some sources in the industry suggest that Facebook will wait for US regulatory bodies to roll out definite policies, which might take months. Indeed, Facebook’s move seemed to coincide with US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) public announcement regarding crypto-related investments and ICOs that was issued in Dec. 2017. In that statement, SEC chairman Jay Clayton suggested that there is a growing trend for “fraud and manipulation” in the cryptocurrency and ICO markets due to their rising popularity. Clayton also warned investors that there were no ICOs registered with SEC.Essentially, Facebook has set a precedent for other big tech companies, as Google was next to follow. On March 14, soon after reports from crypto advertisers regarding suspensions and account terminations on Adwords (which Google denied at the time) emerged, the company announced that it will ban all cryptocurrency-related advertising of all types (ICOs, exchanges, wallets etc.) in June 2018. The policy will apply to Google search, Google-owned platforms including YouTube and display-advertising on third-party sites. The company also announced it is pulling cryptocurrency mining extensions from its Chrome Web Store this week.Explaining the decision to ban cryptocurrency-related advertising, Scott Spencer, the Director of Sustainable Ads at Google, told CNBC:""We don't have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we've seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it's an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.”On March 26, Twitter confirmed rumors that the social media giant would follow Facebook and Google in clamping down on crypto-related advertising. The ban covered advertising for ICOs and token sales only. In addition, the policy also included bans on cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services, unless they are public companies and are listed on major stock exchanges.“We know that this type of content is often associated with deception and fraud, both organic and paid, and we are proactively implementing several signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner,” the company explained to Bloomberg.Recent reports also confirmed that Snap Inc., the company behind Snapchat, has been silently restricting ads for token sales since February, whilst its future plans on the rest of crypto ads types remain unclear.At this point, all major social media platforms have announced (or have already implemented) restrictions on cryptocurrency and ICO advertising. It’s worth noting that Facebook and Twitter control about 60-70 percent of the online advertising market.Although soon after the Facebook’s announcement Jan. 30 Bitcoin took a hit and collapsed from roughly $10,166 to $6,914 by Feb. 5, it managed to come back even stronger: by Feb. 20 the price rallied to $11,228.On March 14, after the news of Google plans to crackdown on crypto and ICO ads, Bitcoin rapidly fell below $8,000, losing about 9 percent of its value.Closer to the end of March, soon after the Twitter ban announcement on March 26, Bitcoin took another hit. its value fell below $7500 on March 29, resulting in the steep sell-off and another depressing week for traders.Some mainstream media including CNBC dubbed the price drops with the scary-sounding label “death cross”, implying that Bitcoin’s short-term movement average was about to cross below its long-term average. That contributed to obligatory public freakouts, although Reddit users kept their cool, even when the “death cross” actually happened on March 30. There was a number of sarcastic comments like “Yes, we crossed it. Now we're all dead”, while others discussed the matter more seriously: many agreed that it was merely a lagging indicator. Some users noticed that Bitcoin had passed the so-called “death crosses” three times before the recent price drop.Users also directly addressed Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey, who argued that Bitcoin will become world’s single currency within a decade just a week before introducing the ban on his social media platform: “I recently read an article that you believe in Bitcoin and fully support it. Then why you're following Facebook's steps and you're now planning to ban cryptocurrencies and ICO-related ads?”John Ratcliff, a game developer, software engineer and prominent cryptocurrency blogger, also claimed that the price drop has nothing to do “with Bitcoin’s network, which has literally never been stronger or more healthy”. Instead, he blamed “ICOs and alt bag-holders cashing out to fiat”, as well as panic-sellers.Industry sources remain positive despite the looming potential for new lows, with various players anticipating the launch of the Lightning Network which might potentially strengthen Bitcoin’s position.Rosemary O'Neill, CEO of Narrative, a Blockchain-based social network that has just finished its ICO, told Cointelegraph that token sale projects don’t actually rely on major social media platforms that much:“Most ICO projects are already much more focused on the ICO directory sites, niche email newsletters, Telegram channels, and Discord rooms than big social. You always want to go where your audience is hanging out, and (sorry Facebook), the crypto crowd isn’t really focused there”.However, according to O’Neill, the process of finding the right clientele has indeed been affected by the recent bans, although to a small degree:“In the cryptocurrency/Blockchain project world, you typically have a two-phased audience…targeting crypto investors or alt coin enthusiasts for the token sale, and then shifting to the target audience for your actual platform or product post-token sale. The recent advertising bans really only make it a bit more difficult to cast a wide net in the first phase”O’Neill claims that her company did not experience a significant loss in terms of token sale participants, although the recent bans seem to enforce the stigma of cryptocurrencies, which certainly doesn’t help: “It has a psychological impact on the way the average person views cryptocurrencies, and we’ve already heard people say, ‘well, Google’s not allowing it, it must be bad’ referring to all cryptocurrencies, which just isn’t true. It’s really unfortunate”.Ben Noble, a founding partner of a marketing and PR company called MarketBlok, suggests that after the Google ban, the market will never be the same. “The mere suggestion of a Google ban shrank the market significantly. Much of the damage is already done. However, the ban will further create market attrition among companies that can't fit into a new organic marketing paradigm. Good technology generally speaks for itself. But clever marketing will put a select few Blockchain companies on a pedestal”.According to Noble, companies have shifted their resources from paid advertisements to direct marketing, public relations, brand journalism and search engine optimization (SEO). “With paid platforms dwindling, Blockchain companies need to make more calculated decisions with their marketing budget. Unfortunately, the sudden crackdowns have thrown the market off balance. Journalists are drowning in a cacophony of pitches, and bots and spam posting on social channels has accelerated”.Noam Cohen, executive at Fusion, confirms the existence of growing stigma provoked by the big tech’s clampdown. “It is of course related to an increasing number of scams that have been surfacing in ICOs, and the increasing difficulty to ascertain to what degree is a new venture ""scammy"" - I think that public perception is becoming more negative of this space”.The ever-growing number of various ICOs has even reached the point of becoming meme-worthy, Cohen adds:“At face value, all ICOs now look the same - website design, countdown clocks, KYC [know your customer] and capping methodology - So similar that humorous memes have appeared mocking the template for a successful ICO. This 'winning template' has been so widely adopted that, for much of the public who is not tech-savvy enough to read white papers it becomes even more difficult to distinguish a good project from a scam; And the default attitude towards new projects is that of extreme skepticism”.That, in turn, rushed the social media platforms to protect their customers. “In this atmosphere, one might imagine that any advertising of such new projects creates a liability for the media/channel, of being perceived as aiding and abetting fraud, and hence, the new policy.”, he says.O’Neill confirms that assumption. She also adds that while it is not wrong to protect your consumers from bad actors, the action could have been more delicate to legitimate businesses:“We feel the blanket ban is a knee-jerk response that ultimately dampens enthusiasm for what will be a world-changing technology of blockchain and cryptocurrency. The good news is that advertising bans are not going to stop that technology from happening; it’s like trying to stop the tide with a bucket”.Noble warns that an investor shouldn't evaluate a company solely on the platform used for promotion. “I'd be more concerned with the message of the advertisements. If an advertisement is pushing moon Lambos and unrealistic expectations for ROI, bail”.A significant percentage of scams tend to stand out in comparison to legitimate ICOs. “The perpetrators of scams are looking for a quick buck and often rely on volume of outreach rather than quality of message. They tend to leave obvious holes in logic. Rule of thumb is: if you don't understand what a company does, don't invest.”, Noble adds.The ICO team’s online presence should always be investigated, too. As Jonathan Hobbs, author of “The Crypto Portfolio: a Commonsense Approach to Cryptocurrency Investing”, puts it: “If you can’t find information about them on Google or Linkedin, they probably don’t exist”.There are other factors besides social media marketing of ICOs, too: Hobbs highlights two particularly important ones: the strength of the ICO project team and the so-called ‘token economics’.“Token economics encompass various metrics on how the ICO investment is structured to determine the potential value to the investor. A simple metric to consider here, for example, would be the price of the token at ICO relative the total supply of coins, and the traction the project team already has in achieving the goals set out in their roadmap”.Hobbs believes that the regulatory crackdown is not necessarily harmful for the ICO market in the long term:“The banning of ICO advertisements by companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter may not seem like the best thing to some, but it could help further legitimize the ICO industry in the coming years. By restricting their ability to advertise, it’s harder for scammers to find unsuspecting retail investors to buy into their projects.”He also pinpoints that mainstream stock companies don’t promote their services to the public through paid advertising as it would be a “regulatory nightmare”. Hobbs believes that “If cryptocurrencies and ICOs are to be taken more seriously by large institutional investors (big banks, pension funds, asset managers and so on), then they should do the same”.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Social Networks    #Facebook    #Twitter    #Google    #ICO  
"India’s Central Bank To Stop Dealing With All Crypto-Related Accounts, ‘Not Ban On Crypto’ Commenters Say",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/5/2018 15:11,32944,407,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced that the bank will no longer provide services to any person or business that deals with cryptocurrencies, adding that it is also looking into releasing its own cryptocurrency in the future, according to a “Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies” released today, April 5.India’s Finance Ministry had criticized Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies for their “lack of intrinsic value” in January of this year, and the month saw several large Indian banks close or limit the functionality of crypto exchange accounts. In early February, false reports in the media of a country-wide crypto ban in early February led to a drop in the crypto markets.RBI’s statement reads that although the technological innovations that support cryptocurrencies “have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system [...] Virtual Currencies (VCs] [...] raise concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others.”RBI continues by noting that they have already warned those involved in the crypto industry several times of the “various risks” of dealing with cryptocurrencies before stating finally that:“In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified time.”According to local news outlet Quartz India, the period of time for businesses to extract themselves from the crypto sphere is three months.At a press conference today, Bibhu Prasad Kanungo, the deputy governor of RBI, said in regards to the decision that cryptocurrencies have the potential to “endanger financial stability:”“Internationally, while the regulatory response to these tokens are not uniform, it is universally felt that they can seriously undermine the AML (anti-money laundering) and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) framework, adversely impact market integrity and capital control. And if they grow beyond a critical size, they can endanger financial stability as well.”Panjak Jain, who works in Blockchain and crypto communities in India as an investor and an advisor, posted a series of tweets today about the new RBI crypto regulations, underlining that the Indian government “hasn’t banned crypto:”1/ Today the Reserve Bank of #India issued a circular telling ""entities registered with the RBI"" (essentially banks, financial firms) to stop working with crypto exchanges and businesses. The Indian government, hasn't banned #crypto.Jain’s further tweets note that “the Indian government is obviously not coordinating amongst the various parts of the government,” citing that income tax is being collected on crypto traders, and adding that it is “interesting” that “RBI cut off fiat from crypto exchanges that have been following fairly good KYC/AML practices used by Indian institutions:”8/ The Indian crypto market is still pretty small but offers a lot of future growth and opportunities, especially for the unbanked. I hope the RBI and the rest of the Indian government rethink this decision and take a more positive approach towards #crypto.Meanwhile, the same RBI statement on the end of its association with crypto dealings adds that the bank will be looking into creating its own state-backed cryptocurrency, “in addition to the paper currency that we have,” Kanungo notes, with a report to be submitted on its feasibility by the end of June 2018.RBI’s interest in their own cryptocurrency is due to the “rapid changes in the landscape of the payments industry along with factors such as emergence of private digital tokens and the rising costs of managing fiat paper/metallic money,” which they cite as the impetus for central banks around the world to introduce “fiat digital currencies.”Kanungo adds that a state-backed cryptocurrency could “hol[d] the promise of reducing the cost of printing of notes.”Sathvik Vishwanath, the co-founder of India’s Unocoin, told Quartz India that he doesn’t believe this is the “right direction that the central bank has taken:”“This will cause panic among a few million people in India who are already using cryptocurrrencies [sic]. If they want to launch their own digital currencies, they don’t need to ban existing ones.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Central Bank    #Cryptocurrencies

Beyond this single event, statistics released by Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) revealed that over $6.2 mln (¥662.4 mln) in cryptocurrency was defrauded or stolen in 2017.With the NEM Foundation’s tracking of the missing NEM (XEM) from Coincheck, Japanese police were able to identify and question an individual in Tokyo in possession of Coincheck spoils in February.By mid-March, forty percent of the stolen funds were said to have already been laundered, with stolen NEM (XEM) surfacing on exchanges in Japan and Canada. Tracking was subsequently called to a halt.Japanese police received 69,977 reports of cybercrime between January and June of 2017.

CoinList provides even more integrity to the startups that have already distinguished themselves, and comfort to the accredited investors that want to commit to [B]lockchain technology.""Launching an ICO in the US requires a company to either register for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accredited investor exemption, or register their ICO as a security offering.ICOs across the country have been shut down due to what the SEC cites as a selling of “unregistered securities,” most recently in Massachusetts, in part due to the SEC’s recently launched cryptocurrency probe.The Praetorian Group filed in early March with the SEC to register their ICO as a security offering; if their application is accepted, they will become the first company to hold an SEC-regulated ICO.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #ICO    #SEC    #Digital Currency Group    #Blockchain Capital

Japan’s Financial Services Agency will deliberate on the proposal, which could eventually be made into law in a few years time, according to Bloomberg.The paper establishes issuance principles, such as defining and disclosing a means of tracking the progress of white papers, and disclosing potential influences on token investors, shareholders, and debt holders.Additionally the paper stipulates certain trading principles, among which are the confirmation of customer identity and suitability (Know Your Customer), the adoption of industry-wide minimum standards on token listings, and the restriction of unfair trade practices like insider trading.While admitting that “it is difficult at present to classify whole ICO [sic] since many forthcoming but unknown types might exist”, the paper proposes that the regulations would apply to three types of ICO: a venture company type, an ecosystem type for collaborative efforts with multiple corporations or government entities, and a large company type for in-house, high risk project funding.The report clearly identifies ICOs as securities, similar to the position taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Researcher Kenji Marashima said that, “ICOs are groundbreaking technology, so if we can implement good principles and rules, they have the potential to become a new way to raise funding.”One advisor to the study group, Takuya Hirai, is a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and one of the architects of a law legalizing cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan last year.

County Authorities In Rural Washington Catch Unauthorized Cryptocurrency Miners,Ana Alexandre,4/5/2018 2:05,24109,329,"Chelan Public Utility District (PUD) commissioners ordered staff to enforce the moratorium on cryptocurrency mining following the discovery of unauthorized mining activities, Chelan PUD reported Monday, April 2.The enforcement measures, which include fines and penalties, disconnecting service, “reporting unauthorized loads to law enforcement as power theft”, and “firing officials to protect public safety”, follow the ratification of a March 19 moratorium on applications for cryptocurrency mining. The fees proposed by the staff could amount to “$5,000 for unauthorized operations in residential areas and $7,000 to $10,000 in commercial space.”The commissioners became concerned with the state and safety of electricity systems after discovering several cases of unauthorized digital currency mining, including those in an apartment, a home, and mini-storage units. Each mining point was consuming enough electricity to cause concern for fire safety, as the facilities were not designed for such a load.According to Customer Utilities managing director John Stoll, monthly power consumption of the apartment skyrocketed from 500 kilowatt hours (kwH) to 11,000-plus kwH, which is far above the norm. Commissioner Garry Arseneault characterized the offenders as “scoundrels”, saying:“What we’re discussing is a person who is purposely trying to slip around the end and use power in a way that a facility was not designed for and doing so in a manner where there’s been no request for service to meet that kind of demand. I see yet, once again, a reason to support the installation of automated meters to be able to confront these scoundrels before they do burn an apartment building down and perhaps kill a family or children in the process.”The move by the PUD commissioners aims to address safety hazards from rogue operations such as overloaded grid equipment, fire risks for neighbors, in addition to the district’s costs for investigation and monitoring of illegal cryptocurrency operations.Miners have flocked to some small American cities due to cheaper electrical costs, which is essential for gaining profit in the field. As a consequence, many small towns are struggling to keep up with demand. Last month, the city council of Plattsburgh, NY approved an 18 month moratorium on Bitcoin mining activities in the town, aiming to make miners pay for overages of the city’s power budget.In January, CNBC reported on power grid overloads caused by mining operations in Douglas County, WA. However, the problem was met with a plan to add 100 megawatts in data centers to keep up with demand.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA    #Government    #Mining

"Traditional Markets Start Off Q2 With Record Low, Crypto Markets See Slight Growth",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/4/2018 14:10,17651,233,"The end of the first quarter of 2018 saw not only poor performances in the crypto market – which lost around 50 percent of total market cap – but also a poor second quarter start for the traditional markets, with the S&P 500 Index’s slump of 2.2 percent Monday, April 2 marking the lowest April start numbers since before the 1929 Great Depression, according to data from Bloomberg.The crypto markets poor performance during the first quarter can arguably be attributed to increasing regulation of the crypto-related sphere, while the traditional markets weak start to the second quarter has more direct political actions causing the decline.Founder of investment management firm DoubleLine Capital Jeffrey Gundlach told Reuters on Monday, April 2, the second quarter’s start day, that Bitcoin (BTC) has become the “lead horse” of risk assets and thus the “new” stock market indicator:“Bitcoin closed at the low of the year last week, SPX (Standard & Poor’s 500 Index) is now at the low of the year this week. Bitcoin keeps leading.”Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) reportedly had their worst first quarters in the history of the two cryptocurrencies, with BTC losing about 52 percent of its value since Jan. 1, and ETH around 48 percent.At the second quarter’s start on April 2, BTC was trading for around $6,924 at the start of the day, and ETH for around $383. Total market cap is currently around $266 bln according to data from CoinMarketCap, slightly up from the April 2 start of around $258 bln.The beginning of January saw the S&P 500 Index at around 2,695 points, while the market closed yesterday at about 2,614 points, up over 23 points, but with the Year-to-Date Return listed as a loss of a little over 2.2 percent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had experienced a significant drop of more than 1,100 points in early February 2018, which was its largest intraday drop since 2011. On April 2, the Dow Jones closed 459 points down, and was down as much as 758 points at one time during the first trading day of the second quarter, according to numbers from CNN Money.CNN Money reports today, April 4, that the Dow Jones is set to drop 600 points when the markets open due to China’s announcement of new tariffs on $50 bln worth of US exports. China’s new tariffs appear to be a response to the Trump administrations’ tariffs on $50 bln worth of Chinese exports announced yesterday.Another possible contribution to the poor second quarter traditional market start is Trump’s criticism of Amazon on Twitter at the end of March, leading to the American retail giant’s stock falling 7 percent since the Trump’s critique began.The Dow Jones closed yesterday, April 3, at around 24,033 points, up around 389 points, but down about 2.77 percent according to the listed Year-to-Date return, after trading around 24,824 in early January.The crypto markets are continuing to see a general slight increase since the Feb. 5 nosedive below $7000 for BTC – which had corresponded with the Dow Jones’ record setting intraday low.And as the traditional markets reportedly brace for the next predicted drops due to China’s new tariffs and Trump’s continuing Amazon critiques, BTC remains above $7,000 and ETH is close to $400, both psychological price points for crypto traders, up slightly from the first day of Q2.BTC is currently trading for around $7,140, down 3.45 percent on the day to press time. ETH is also down around 4 percent on the day, trading for around $389 by press time.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Markets    #Cryptocurrencies    #Amazon    #China    #USA    #CoinMarketCap  
Fintech Firm’s Stock Drops By 30 Percent Following Announcement of SEC Investigation,Aaron Wood,4/4/2018 3:47,33618,219,"Following the announcement of an investigation by the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) into is business, stock value of the fintech firm Longfin dropped by 30 percent, CNBC reported April 3.Longfin disclosed the investigation in a public 10-K filing to the SEC on April 2. Longfin shares closed 30.89 percent lower today, trading at $9.89 a share. This year so far the stock is down by 82.43 percent.Longfin is a NASDAQ-listed fintech company (LFIN) whose market cap skyrocketed more than 1,000 percent in two days last December following an announcement that they acquired Ziddu.com, a firm specializing in smart contracts and micro-lending using Blockchain technology.LFIN Stock Chart Dec. 2017-April 2018Source: nasdaq.comThe Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed Longfin on March 5 that they would be investigating trading in the company’s shares and requested documents regarding its IPO and acquisition of Ziddu.com. Longfin expressed its full intention in cooperating with the SEC investigation in the 10-K filing:“We are in the process of responding to this document request and will cooperate with the SEC in connection with its investigation. While the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law.”Even Longfin CEO Venkat Meenavalli acknowledged the enormous spike in stock value last December, stating, “This market cap is not justified. I valued my IPO pricing at $5.” Meenavalli added, “We are a profitable company… We have nothing to do with this euphoric mania.”In January of this year, the SEC reported it would crack down on companies that used public enthusiasm surrounding Blockchain technology to manipulate their stock prices. ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #USA    #Government    #Fintech  
Australia Launches New Cryptocurrency Exchange Regulations,William Suberg,4/3/2018 12:11,20903,330,"Australian cryptocurrency exchanges must abide by new anti-money laundering (AML) rules from April 3, the government has confirmed.According to fresh information now available on the website of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), ‘digital currency exchanges’ must now register with authorities, as well as commit to various reporting and identity checking procedures.The move comes as Australian authorities attempt to seal the remaining loopholes in cryptocurrency use regarding tax and identity management.Against a backdrop of discontent due to a sharp rise in scams, the Australian Taxation Office last week asked for taxpayers’ input into how deductions arising from cryptocurrency profits should best be gathered.As part of the security reshape, meanwhile, exchanges must now adhere to four principal rules in order to operate above board:A six-month grace period will accompany the new regulations, during which AUSTRAC will be more lenient on operators who fall short of requirements.“A ‘policy principles’ period of six months will be in place from 3 April 2018.

Taiwan Central Bank Governor Suggests Bitcoin Transactions Should Fall Under AML Regulation,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/2/2018 15:22,15050,229,"The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) has recommended that Bitcoin (BTC) trading should be regulated under the Department of Justice’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, local news outlet Focus Taiwan reports today, April 2.In October of last year, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) had shown support for Initial Coin Offering (ICO), cryptocurrency, and Blockchain adoption and innovation within the country.In response to concerns broached about BTC’s recently falling prices at a meeting with Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan Finance Committee, Yang Chin-long, the governor of the central bank, said that the bank’s “response measures” to the noted “opacity” of BTC transactions are to first remind investors of risks, and then to move towards BTC AML regulation.Yang Chin-long became governor of the central bank only in February, where he immediately indicated the bank’s friendly attitude towards Blockchain technologies in his speech at the handover ceremony.Wu Bing-rui, a legislator for Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party, also asked Yang Chin-long if there was a need to pay attention to Bitcoin mining in the country, citing the figure that the cost of mining in Taiwan is the third lowest in the world due to low electricity cost.According to Yang Chin-long, most of Taiwan’s BTC mining technology manufacturers are located in mainland China, but that does not mean that the government shouldn’t pay attention to the effect of BTC mining on Taiwan’s power usage.Debate about the potential harm caused by cryptocurrency mining’s high energy consumption has recently increased as countries like Iceland - which attracts miners due to its cold climate and access to renewable energy - and US states like Washington - who have low electricity costs - are seeing an influx of miners that are using more energy than regular households and overloading electrical infrastructure.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taiwan    #AML    #ICO    #Bitcoin Adoption    #Banks    #Bitcoin Mining    #Iceland    #Cryptocurrencies  
Trading Opens On Crypto Exchange Giant Huobi In South Korea,Marie Huillet,4/1/2018 20:36,31710,715,"Trading has officially opened in South Korea on the Beijing-born Huobi crypto exchange, according to Huobi Group’s official announcement March 30.Huobi’s new South Korean subsidiary supports 100 altcoins and trading on 208 markets (77 ETH markets, 98 BTC markets, and 33 USDT markets).It also offers an investor protection fund and program to swiftly recompense investors in cases of losses incurred outside of their control.Huobi Pro global exchange currently ranks second worldwide by trade volume, according to Coinmarketcap as of press time.The Huobi group launched its Huobi Pro exchange, headquartered in Singapore, after the Chinese government clamped down on ICOs and domestic crypto-fiat exchanges in September 2017.

"Utah Bitcoin Bill Passes Senate Reading, 2 Votes Away from Law",Charlie Richards,3/9/2015 11:29,875,0,"A bill aimed at getting the state of Utah to accept bitcoin for states services passes its first reading in the Senate.The bill has now passed its first Senate reading having already passed through the House of Representatives with a slim majority of 38 Yes votes against 36 No's.Utah state representative Marc K. Roberts introduced the proposal, Bill H.C.R 6, to the Clerk of the House of Representatives on February 10.The bill states in its general description that its aim is to look into how the state could accept bitcoin, specifically:“This concurrent resolution of the Legislature and the Governor proposes the creation of the Council on Payment Options for State Services to study whether and how the state could accept bitcoin as a valid form of payment.”The wording of the bill, however means that even if the senate approves the motion on its second and third readings, then the question of whether it is feasible for the state to accept bitcoin for payment of state services remains in the hands of an investigating “Council on Payment Options.”Following the proposed legislation's arrival at the state's senate though, the Senate  Revenue and Taxation Committee have already given the bill their nod of approval by three votes in favor to one opposed. The outcome of the legislated Council on Payment Options could therefore be equally favorable.Roberts though appears to believe the benefit of Bitcoin extends beyond the idea of the state saving money on payment processing fees. The representative explains that the bill's text aim to lay out a greater vision for how the cryptocurrency could help Utah.“THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah, and the Governor concurring therein, recognizes the potential benefits that could come from the expanded use of bitcoin in the state and recognizes that the state could be a key player in promoting the use of bitcoin.”Salt Lake City based Overstock.com gets a name check in the text of the bill as an example of a bitcoin accepting business thriving in the state. The electronics distributor would be in line to save on its payment processing fees were it able to  directly convert BTC sales on its website into payments for state services.Utah is one of three US states where politicians are currently fielding legislation aimed at getting the local government to accept Bitcoin payments, alongside New Hampshire, and New York.Cointelegraph recently reported on the efforts by New Hampshire Representative Eric Schleien to pass bill HR552. Schleien's version of the proposal takes a stronger stance by avoiding the investigative council step, and heading straight to an implementation plan. Bill HR552 is worded that its focus is:“Requiring the state treasurer to develop an implementation plan for the state to accept bitcoin as payment for taxes and fees.”Cointelegraph spoke to CEO of Galactic Systems, Mike Lorrey, who ran in for a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 2014 on a similar pro-cryptocurrency platform.“I would say it's very useful as far as popular acceptance of bitcoin goes. Once the states have to accept it then the banks will be right behind. It's then that we'll see the price of bitcoin start rising again on a long-term trend.”With the Utah bill now nearing the completion of its journey through the senate, Bitcoin could receive a legitimizing vote of confidence from the state. Did you enjoy this article?

Digital Currency ATMs and Exchanges Must Be Authorized Says Quebec Financial Regulator,Diana Ngo,2/13/2015 11:00,246,0,"Businesses operating a digital currency automated teller machine (ATM) or an exchange platform in Quebec must obtain the appropriate license from the financial regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), in accordance to the Money-Services Businesses Act.The authority, which issued a public statement on Thursday February 12, said that companies involved in trading digital currencies, or which are operating a digital currency ATM, must hold the appropriate license and be authorized by the AMF, the regulatory and oversight body for Quebec's financial industry.The AMF further indicated that it had published the amendments to the Policy Statement to the Money-Services Businesses Act, which intend to reflect the legal framework set under the said Act that governs these particular types of economical activities in the province of Quebec.While the AMF is overseeing those businesses, the authority is not regulating digital currencies, and further warns consumers of the risks associated with dealing with digital currencies, notably volatility and liquidity risks.The authority stated:""Transactions involving virtual currency are not covered by the financial services compensation fund or the deposit insurance fund.Quebeckers should therefore be careful with virtual currency transactions as they may incur losses that are not covered under current compensation or deposit insurance plans.""The AMF also noted that the nearly anonymous characteristic of digital currency transactions and their low costs might incentivize fraudsters to set up Ponzi schemes and scams. Digital currency might also be used to facilitate fraudulent transactions or fabricate fraudulent investments, the authority added.The Money-Services Businesses Act, which came into effect on April 1, 2012, implies that businesses providing money services, including conversion, fund transfers, issuance or redemption of traveler’s checks, money orders or bank drafts, check cashing, and the operation of a privately owned ATM, must acquire the appropriate licensing from the AMF.The said Act also stipulates that such enterprises must provide certain information, notably about their directors, officers, partners, as well as lenders.Applications are reviewed by the AMF, the Sûreté du Québec and the local municipal police.Canada is currently the second nation to host the largest number of Bitcoin ATMs with 61 devices, according to CoinATMRadar.In Quebec alone, there are currently 19 machines, indicated Sylvain Théberge, a spokesperson for the AMF. The first Bitcoin ATM arrived last year, in the city center of Montreal.Jillian Friedman, a cryptocurrency and e-commerce lawyer and counsel for the Bitcoin Embassy, told local media outlet Le Devoir:""The AMF announcement allows [us to] have [further] clarification, but I am surprised that it was issued before publication of rulings from the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada, the FINTRAC.""According to the Bitcoin Embassy, the AMF announcement shows that ""Bitcoin is indeed a legitimate alternative to the actual monetary and financial system.""However, the organization worries that Quebec's regulatory framework might be stricter than the potential legal framework of FINTRAC. Did you enjoy this article?

‘Forcing Bitcoin into the Regulated Environment’: Interview with Digital Securities Exchange,William Suberg,1/28/2015 10:37,238,0,"In the wake of Coinbase unveiling the US’s first licensed Bitcoin exchange, across the water in the UK, another operation is adopting a different, but no less official, approach.Digital Securities Exchange, or DSX, is launching the country’s first trading platform to employ an accredited third party processor to run all its transactions. It has partnered with ePayments Systems Ltd, which is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).“DSX has chosen to take an alternative approach by drawing parallels between e-money as an established and regulated product and digital currency,” the company stated in a press release issued last week regarding its launch.The concept of blurring the treatment of e-money and digital currency may strike many as something which was perhaps inevitable as both areas matured. However, DSX’s bold and even controversial language regarding its attitude to digital currency regulation is certain to raise more than a few eyebrows:“This simple, yet very effective move, produced something entirely unique by running all transactions via ePayments, DSX forced bitcoin into the regulated environment.”Willingly incorporating digital currency into a regulatory framework is not something which the decentralization community has traditionally taken well, so it is its use by DSX as a promotional tool which is all the more surprising.Cointelegraph was able to reach out to ePayments CEO Mike Rymanov and DSX’s Marketing Director Pari Andrade to learn more about their style of Bitcoin advocacy and their confidence in championing regulation to the current Bitcoin community and beyond.CT: A recent DSX press release stated that you had ""forced Bitcoin into the regulatory environment"". The issue of regulation has been a controversial one within the cryptocurrency community. How do you think consumers will react to DSX presenting it as an attribute, and as the right way to go in order for Bitcoin to become mainstream?PA: In my opinion, in order for Bitcoin to become mainstream one way or another it would have to get assimilated into current heavily regulated financial markets. Otherwise, it runs a risk of remaining a niche phenomena, never reaching mass adaptation.According to the UK Financial Conduct Authority it has three operational objectives:• To secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers.• To protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system.• To promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.We have made a conscious choice to establish DSX under the guidance, rules and regulations of the FCA as we strongly believe in setting our priorities right from the beginning. Protection of consumer funds, appropriate level of customer due diligence, FCA approved personnel, systems and controls are all in place with one aim in mind - to become a catalyst to a wider bitcoin consumer adaptation.To answer your question, being a consumer myself, I believe it is all about trust. A company that has made significant investments to establish a regulated business has a great deal to lose and not just from the investment point of view.Non-compliance carries a significant amount of risk starting from heavy fines to jail time to directors who are personally liable. I cannot think of a better motivator to make sure that the priorities are always met. At DSX we strongly believe that forcing bitcoin into the regulated environment will help us to build that trust. CT: What would you say to other UK-based digital currency startups in terms of insuring their business against regulatory shifts, such as those which occurred in the Isle of Man scene last year? Are you yourself worried about this?PA: Regulatory changes are inevitable and when a change happens in order to stay in business companies must adapt. When it comes to regulating bitcoin, as you have pointed out in the Isle of Man example, the situation is very fluent. My recommendation to digital currency startups would be to deliberately take time and analyze current regulatory environment, look into the products that they intend to release in short term and medium term and seek advice whether any of the intended products would naturally fall under regulations.Let me give you an example. At the moment spot bitcoin trading is not regulated in the UK, however, in order to offer margin trading a Consumer Credit license is needed, derivatives would require a Multilateral Trading Facility license. These are complex licenses requiring a great deal of planning from organizational, technological, HR and financial points of view. Early professional advice is an absolute must to make any startup future proof.CT: What made you choose the UK as a base for DSX, as opposed to an EU state with a more relaxed stance such as Denmark, or elsewhere?MR: United Kingdom has the most developed financial market and regulations in the world. Establishing DSX in the UK was a natural choice for us. Being the CEO of ePayments, authorized e-money institution, and having built it from scratch I’m very familiar with the UK regulatory and business environment. Furthermore, over the years, I have built an extensive professional network that I can always call upon for a sound advice. Finally, the UK is my home where I have lived for nearly 20 years.CT: How do you foresee a balance being struck between regulations and upholding of the decentralized values, which made Bitcoin so popular in the first place? Do you think a fully regulated exchange will ultimately prove more popular than an unregulated decentralized one?PA: In my opinion, the decentralized nature of bitcoin will only benefit from proportionally applied regulation. Relevant consumer protection will built trust and strengthen the adaptation of this breakthrough technology. By providing reliable, predictable and secure transaction environment regulated exchanges will capture a significant part of the market.Did you enjoy this article?

"Appcoins, Crypto Crowdfunding, and the Potential SEC Regulation Pitfall",Jason Somensatto,1/7/2015 10:23,545,0,"A quick scan of any popular cryptocurrency forum will reveal numerous announcements for crowdfunding campaigns intended to support the launch of a new altcoin or decentralized application.In these crowd sales, digital tokens associated with the application (called “appcoins”) are sold to early adopters in an effort to raise capital for the new project. The hope of many who purchase appcoins in a crowd sale is that the price of the coin will go up significantly if the application becomes widely adopted.In response to these crowdfunding campaigns, some have warned that certain appcoins seem to have the characteristics of a security that may be subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although many, including the developers, may prefer to ignore these warnings, they do so at their own risk. The SEC’s regulatory powers apply broadly and are very restrictive, and recent reports indicate that the SEC has already started to turn its focus to the so-called Crypto 2.0 marketplace. This article provides a basic overview of the legal definition of a security and then discusses the aspects of appcoins that may trigger the SEC’s interest.Securities offered in the U.S. generally must be registered with the SEC and meet many legal requirements. As a threshold matter, the securities statutes define the term “security” very broadly. The definition covers a list of specific instruments, like stocks and bonds, but also covers more vague concepts like “investment contracts” and “instruments commonly known as securities.”  This broad definition has been interpreted to mean that what is considered a security is not limited only to formal instruments traded on securities exchanges. Rather, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, the legal definition of a security also extends to “uncommon and irregular instruments,” which generally fall within the following accepted framework:A point of clarification is that an instrument is generally not considered a security when the purchaser is motivated by the desire to use or consume the item purchased.There have been numerous court cases decided over the years that address when a specific financial instrument does or does not meet the legal definition of a security. Any individual team developing a new coin that has features like a security and that will be issued to U.S. customers should be working with a securities lawyer to determine how their product fits within the historical precedent of these cases. To be clear, there have been several new coins or tokens advertised as equity shares in a company that clearly violate the prohibition against offering unregistered securities in the U.S. Conversely, the rise of appcoins designed to be essential to the use of new decentralized applications presents a more difficult case requiring a more nuanced analysis.Several new decentralized applications have recently raised capital from early adopters through a crowdsale of appcoins. In the past year, Maidsafe, Ethereum, Storj, and a host of other projects have all conducted some form of crowdsale before launching their applications. In addition, an industry of platforms, like Swarm and Koinify, which promise to promote and manage these crowd sales, has sprouted up to aid development teams looking to go the crowdfunding route.The purpose of these crowdfunding campaigns can be varied, but typically the goal is to raise money to pay the developers, initially distribute coins fairly amongst a large group, and perhaps most importantly to this discussion, entice early adopters by offering appcoins at a perceived discount well-below their potential future value.From this description, the parallels between an appcoin and a security should be obvious. Like stock sold during an initial public offering, appcoins are sold to raise capital for a common enterprise. Unlike participants in a Kickstarter campaign who may have charitable intentions and hopes of a free t-shirt, investors are attracted to the crowd sale of appcoins by the allure of profits. Profits are possible because the appcoins have a fluid value that is, at least partially, tied to the success and popularity of the underlying project being funded.On the other hand, this discussion does not fully address all the characteristics of some appcoins that may make them different from a typical security. For example, most appcoins do not give the holder any traditional legal rights accompanying a security, such as control over ownership or an entitlement to dividends and to assets upon liquidation. Instead, appcoins are often described as software-defined contracts that are integral to how consumers use the network application.For example, an appcoin like Storjcoin X is touted as necessary to incentivize participants to offer unused disk space to the Storj network, which in turn is necessary to create this new form of cloud storage. Because of the functional use of appcoins, some equate them to a product or something akin to frequent flyer miles and other proprietary currencies that companies issue. And if these descriptions seem incomplete, perhaps the truth is that appcoins can only be viewed as a completely new form of asset class that the SEC will need to decide if and how to regulate.The argument that appcoins are unique and distinct from securities is a position not without its flaws though. For one, the functional necessity of an appcoin does not mean that a project must be crowdfunded. Bitcoin, Counterparty, and others have proven that a crowd sale is not required to get a new project off the ground. Additionally, for many decentralized applications, an existing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could be used to incentivize the network instead of relying on a proprietary appcoin. As a result, the creation of an appcoin may be seen as merely a means to store enterprise value like a security. The argument that appcoins are akin to frequent flyer miles also fails to take into account that frequent flyer miles have limited transferability and a defined value rather than being freely traded at fluctuating prices on an exchange. Finally, as mentioned above, these arguments are not even applicable to the numerous problematic offerings that openly admit to be issuing stocks in a company by issuing tokens on a platform like Counterparty or Colored Coins.Savvy project teams often try to describe an appcoin crowd sale in terms that avoid the suggestion that they are offering securities. For example, before Ethereum’s “Genesis Sale” of Ether, the Swiss entity behind the project put out a legal document detailing the terms and conditions of the pre-sale. This document reads like a prospectus that usually accompanies a typical securities offering, but the Ethereum team was careful not to call it that. In this document and other public statements, the team repeatedly emphasized that the sale was not a securities offering. Instead, the team described Ether as the “cryptographic fuel” needed to conduct transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, and identified Ether as a “software product” under Swiss law. Purchasers of Ether agreed through the terms and conditions that they were not purchasing Ether as a speculative investment.Ethereum is the exception to the rule, though. Seemingly less sophisticated projects are often more loose with the language of their offerings. Many such projects openly refer to pre-sales as IPOs and to purchases made during pre-sales as investments. Indeed, often pre-sales are not subject to any legal terms or conditions that disclose to investors that the pre-sale is not supposed to be a securities offering.Despite this, the truth is that the language of the offering is less important than the characteristics of the product being offered. If the SEC scrutinizes any of these offerings, it will definitely look at the terminology used, but will be more focused on analyzing the qualitative factors discussed above. In the end, even the pre-sale of a product like Ether may be viewed by an aggressive regulator as a securities offering. To support such an interpretation, one need only look at the thousands of comments on the Bitcointalk.org forum announcement about Ethereum, most of which debate the potential return of an early investment as opposed to the benefits of the final project. That being said, the teams who are prepared to answer why the crowd sale of their new appcoin does not fit the definition of a securities offering, as Ethereum is obviously positioned to do, are much more likely to dissuade regulatory scrutiny by the SEC.The one approach that has seen very little traction has been for developers of decentralized applications to admit that they are offering regulated securities and attempt to make their offerings comply with the securities laws. The various requirements of the U.S. securities laws are better left to another article, but there are procedures for offering unregistered securities to accredited investors and there are proposed regulations in the pipeline that would legalize so-called equity crowdfunding. For developers willing to comply with such laws, platforms like Counterparty and the proposed Medici project may provide an incredible resource for issuing and trading securities without the regulatory uncertainty.The truth is that, despite outdated rules and institutional inefficiencies, the SEC serves a purpose in trying to protect investors by mitigating the usually sizable information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and investors. There will need to be a push to have the SEC adapt to the new technologies promised by some of the projects mentioned in this article, and to address the arguments in favor of exempting some appcoins from the definition of a security. On the other hand, there is also a need for development teams to not simply ignore unfavorable regulations as they may be necessary to weed out the numerous pump-and-dump schemes many in the community have already seen.The article itself is for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice or create an attorney-client relationship.Jason Somensatto is a lawyer at Morvillo LLP who focuses on securities regulation and enforcement.

Manhattan Community Board Bans Bitcoin Block Party,Carlo C,1/2/2015 18:14,314,0,"The City of New York is following the same path as the state in trying to use regulation to push Bitcoin into obscurity. A Manhattan Community Board ruled that a Bitcoin decentralization block party would be refused permits.The block party was a co-venture between GMT Tavern, a bar and restaurant located in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, and Cut Rush Creative Labs, a Brooklyn-based film production company that specializes in promoting virtual currencies and decentralized solutions through visual media.When the State of New York proposed the BitLicense, Ben Lawsky promised that it would be fair and balanced. When it was finally released for community comments, though, “fair and balanced” was not a term that could be used to describe it.Now a New York City community board has ruled in a meeting, held in October, that it “adamantly opposed” the very idea of a block party to promote Bitcoin. The reasons for the opposition are suspect. The alliance between GMT and Cut Rush Creative Labs was described by the board as a “loose group of individuals who are supporters of decentralized currencies like Bitcoin to promote its use, … who primarily live in Brooklyn and have no ‘indigenous relationship’ to the area.Van Nguyen of Cut Rush Creative spoke to Cointelegraph this morning and believes that the community board is not necessarily opposed to Bitcoin. Instead he believes that they are simply protective of their neighborhoods and are reluctant to issue permits such as this. He said:“They were reluctant not because of Bitcoin, but because the community boards for each area are very reluctant to do any events in their area. What I don't understand are the countless food events where it's just funnel cake and kebab stands. The community board argument is that my event doesn't improve the community and I'm not from that neighborhood. I'm sure most of the kabob stands aren't from the area either.”Nguyen has a point. Not only are they friendly to food events, but also to the fashion industry. On September 16, 2014, the Bleecker Street community sponsored “Teen Vogue,” which featured retailers such as Blackfleece, Intermix, Brunello Cucinelli, Mulberry, Tommy Hilfiger, Steve Madden, Rag & Bone, Cynthia Rowley and others. While some of these companies have offices in Manhattan, none have offices in Greenwich Village.Another objection that the community board made was that the planners of the Bitcoin event could not be considered a “formal organization registered as a non-profit with either the State of New York or the IRS,” implying that this was a requirement. Tommy Hilfiger was not a registered non-profit either.Finally the Board argues that the inclusion of GMT Tavern, which is actually located in the neighborhood, was “nothing more than a matter of convenience and neither it nor any other business or resident in the area has an active role in planning or managing this event.” Again we must look at previous events and ask how many of the local residents or merchants had active planning roles.The community board seems to be very selective in its definitions over what businesses could be considered to be “meaningfully tied” to its community. Promoting Bitcoin, whose adoption by local merchants could save them a great deal of money in future transaction fees, could by itself be a service to the community.Nguyen says that he is working to get local merchants in the area more involved with Bitcoin. The management of GMT is already excited, and a forward-looking area like Greenwich Village could be a prime location to promote virtual currencies. There is a good chance that given more local involvement, the excuses of the community board will be less effective in the future.Did you enjoy this article?

Localbitcoins Germany Withdrawal Raises Questions about Regulation,William Suberg,12/15/2014 13:15,277,0,"Localbitcoins.com has been forced to halt service in Germany due to regulatory fears, prompting renewed questions about the country’s perspective on digital currencies.The stalwart startup announced via Twitter December 8 that it hoped the new status quo would be “temporary”:t.co/byGAoG3WSI won't be available in Germany anymore due to regulatory reasons. We hope this is temporary. Press enquiries via emailIt has emerged that there are new concerns surrounding the need for a potential license in order for companies like Localbitcoins to operate legally in Germany. The pressure is in marked contrast to the scene in neighboring Poland and Netherlands, and another example of the relative discord between EU states on the issue of cryptocurrency.“Was wondering when regulators would notice…,” Jeff Garzik tweeted in response to the news.“We do not know any exact details regarding [the license] yet,” Localbitcoins’ founder Nikolaus Kangas told CoinDesk. “Right now, we are trying to find answers to these questions.”Localbitcoins has built an international presence since its first steps at providing support for the spread of Bitcoin transactions to a wider market. “The roots of this service are actually partly in Germany, so it is kind of ironic and sad that we cannot offer the service there anymore,” Kangas said, adding that Localbitcoins had been contacted by BaFin, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.The suspension is the second setback to come from the European space this week following Pirate Bay’s takedown by Swedish police over alleged copyright infringement. Servers at a location in Sweden were raided and seized following certain leaked movies stolen from the recent Sony hack being made available via Pirate Bay. Other P2P sharing networks are also being targeted, but details of whether this is a result of a law enforcement initiative remain undisclosed, Wired reports.Nonetheless, Swedish exchange Safello today announced partnership with an unnamed UK bank to facilitate cheaper and faster deposits for UK customers, avoiding the need for SEPA transfers and related fees. The move is unusual for the UK, as many of the country’s Bitcoin startups use foreign banking due to a reluctance among domestic services to cooperate. “Hopefully we are at the start of wider bitcoin adoption in the UK,” Safello CEO Frank Schuil told CoinDesk.Elsewhere, Citibank recently took aim at virtual currencies in an apparent effort to influence the outcome of a Swiss referendum on repatriation of its gold reserves, a move already being witnessed in the Netherlands.Germany itself is also the scene of a shake-up for fiat banking. Following the ECB doubling the amount banks pay to deposit funds to 0.2% in September, costs are being passed on by banks to customers in the form of negative interest rates or ‘hidden’ fees.Commerzbank, Germany’s second largest institution was the first to begin charging high-deposit business customers in relation to the fees, with the rate agreed on a case-by-case basis.Elsewhere, domestic banks are raising administrative costs for all account holders across the board, with increases for “services” such as keeping an account open or depositing loose coins.“Banks calculate exactly when it comes to customers. That means they don't want to have to pay extra [to the ECB],” Professor Wolfgang Gerke of the Bavaria Center of Finance commented to German media portal Das Erste. “So if we don't get negative interest, we'll get corresponding fees instead. And when we convert those, we end up with negative interest.”With more and more private customers being affected by the changes, combined with the decrease in Bitcoin opportunities the German market appears to be presenting the customer with an uncomfortable ‘Catch-22’ situation.As of December 15, Localbitcoins remains unavailable in Germany.Did you enjoy this article?

Australian Report Endorses Financial System innovation as Authorities Launch Investigation into Crypto Crime,Diana Ngo,12/8/2014 15:01,144,0,"In light of the Murray report released in November, the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) welcomes the several recommendations issued by the Financial Systems Inquiry, including broadening the types of entities that qualify for an Australian Financial Services License and have access to the Government's Document Verification Service, as well as developing a national strategy group, dubbed the ""Innovation Collaboration.""""I am delighted with the foresightedness of the Murray Report in recognizing the need to update regulations to encourage innovation in the financial system,"" stated Ronald Tucker, Chairman at the ADCCA.""The digital currency industry in Australia is growing, but is being held back by outdated regulations, something that is recognized by the report.""Released on November 8 by Treasurer Joe Hockey, the report is the end result of an inquiry headed by former CEO at the Commonwealth Bank, David Murray.The Financial Systems Inquiry report focused on innovation in the financial services industry as a key theme and identified 44 recommendations as part of the inquiry into regulation of Australia's financial services industry. One of these recommendations encouraged the government into the creation of a public-private sector committee, the ""Innovation Collaboration,"" to help the industry keep pace with innovation. According to the document, the proposed committee should consist of senior industry, government, regulatory, academic, and consumer representatives.""We welcome the recommendation to develop a national identity strategy, which if Implemented, would cut down on e-fraud, boost consumer confidence and reduce compliance costs,"" said Tucker. He added:""We are already working closely with government regulators and legislators to work towards a best practice regulatory framework for the digital currency sector. ADCCA is looking forward to working with established financial players and the government to ensure that everyone benefits from these developments, [...] [and] is keen to participate in the 'Innovation Collaboration.'""The ADCCA is Australia's leading council and representation of and for digital currency businesses. Last month, Sir Richard Branson released an op-ed in which he endorses and supports the organization for its consistent work on standardizing digital currencies.While Australia is looking to build the proper legal framework for emerging technologies that could potentially disrupt the financial services industry, some Bitcoin businesses have been rather unsatisfied with the government's announcement made in August, declaring that fiat-digital transactions would be subject to the Australian 10% general sales tax. Australia-native Bitcoin wallet provider CoinJar was among the disgruntled ones and announced last week it had relocated its physical headquarters from Melbourne to London.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been recently identified as a primary concern for Australian authorities due to its association with criminal activity, as the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) announced last week it had launched Project Longstrike, a government initiative against organized crime involving the digital currency.ACC Executive Director Judy Lind told Reuters that investigators were aware of and would be monitoring ""misuse of virtual currencies to facilitate criminal activity."" The criminal intelligence and investigative agency said it was committed to ensure that Bitcoin isn't used to commit illegal activity in the country.In early October, the Australian Senate announced a hearing on digital currencies, which is due to hand down its report on March 2. Did you enjoy this article?

California Becomes the Second State to Try to Regulate Bitcoin,Carlo C,12/6/2014 11:58,124,0,"California’s Department of Business Oversight has concluded that they have the authority to regulate virtual currencies.Bitcoin is big business in the Golden State. No other state can match its number of Bitcoin-accepting merchants. The state has nearly 400 businesses that accept BTC as payment for goods and services, with only some of them located in the large cities.As Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted, government agencies begin sharpening their regulatory knives. The first agency in California to take this plunge is the state’s DBO. The Department of Business Oversight is responsible for regulating money-transfer businesses, such as Xoom and Western Union.After holding numerous internal meetings on the subject of digital currencies, Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for the department, gave the following statement:“The consensus among staff is that the department and commissioner could regulate virtual currency, to some extent, under current state law. Consumers would be the prime concern of any regulatory structure we build—making sure they are fully aware of the risks associated with virtual currency and providing effective, reasonable safeguards against those risks.”The interesting part of Dresslar’s statement is that it does not address money laundering or the use of virtual currencies by criminals. These are the usual reasons given by government for their interest in regulating Bitcoin.California is the world’s eighth largest economy. Venture capitalists in the state’s Silicon Valley have invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin startups over the past few years. This could explain the lighter hand that seems to be California’s style in response to Bitcoin.The state seems to be treating virtual currencies very lightly, which may be a good idea for them. The money these new technologies are generating can help the state repair some of its disastrous financial problems. California Governor Jerry Brown may have been thinking this when he recently signed a bill, AB 129, making virtual currencies legal in the state.While California regulators are paying more attention to Bitcoin, the state is not alone in struggling to adapt to market changes. Colorado recently legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and that state is reaping tax benefits from the new businesses that are cropping up. The businesses themselves are not having the same luck, though, as banks refuse to deal with any business that sells the herb.Colorado is finding it difficult to track business’s tax bills because those businesses are forced to deal in only cash. The banks are telling both the pot vendors and state officials that federal rules prohibit them from doing business with any “illegal drug enterprises,” and under federal law, recreational marijuana is still illegal.As a consequence of the federal regulations, some of the businesses are moving their assets into Bitcoin, and at least one is accepting Bitcoin in payment for their products. This means that Colorado will potentially begin to consider regulating Bitcoin, at least for tax purposes.California and Colorado have a unique opportunity to build a regulatory regime for virtual currencies around consumer protection. The DBO has scheduled a meeting with the task force assigned to study the issue in mid-December, and new rules could come from their recommendations. The department will also have to consider the reaction of Governor Brown and his support of Bitcoin.Did you enjoy this article?

US Rep. Steve Stockman Introduces Bill to Protect Cryptocurrencies,Carlo C,12/4/2014 17:15,321,0,"United States Representative Steve Stockman (R-Texas) kept his promise and recently introduced a bill in Congress that would not only extend substantial protections to cryptocurrencies, but would also require that cryptocurrencies be classified as a “currency.”The bill, entitled the Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act (CryptPMA), begins by placing a five-year moratorium on any new legislation concerning cryptocurrencies.Stockman has supported virtual currencies for a long time. In 2013, he was interviewed by Nick Spanos, founder of the Bitcoin Center in New York City, when he said:“I believe that Bitcoin is all about freedom: The freedom to keep your money without other people making decisions for you.”Stockman’s main concern is that governments are printing fiat currencies at such a high rate that eventually they will be worthless. He believes that Bitcoin, like gold, cannot be influenced in such a manner and therefore could provide a relief valve for most citizens.This legislation is the complete opposite of New York State’s proposed BitLicense, which members of the virtual-currency community have harshly criticized. Cointelegraph’s William Suberg reported today that recent comments about the BitLicense revealed a hidden agenda promoted by competitors seeking to throttle Bitcoin in its crib.The new bill, H.R. 5777, will immediately prevent the use of such legislation to stop innovations in cryptocurrency, and it will protect both users and developers within the industry by putting the brakes on new attempts similar to those in New York. The bill covers not only the currencies themselves but also extends protection to algorithmic protocols, i.e., the blockchain, beginning on June 1, 2015. Stockman makes it clear that this bill will not prevent the application of currently existing “criminal, civil or taxation statutes and regulations.”Stockman firmly believes that the success of virtual currencies lies in the interest of the public because transactions can be made without the need for third party intermediaries. The wording of the bill makes this clear in the following statement, which says that:“[The development of these currencies] is a circumstance that is likely to result in economic and other efficiencies for the American people and other participants in the domestic economy, and as such may be crucial to overall economic growth, will enhance the economic well-being of the American people and will otherwise be in the public interest.”The public interest also includes defining cryptocurrencies as actual currencies under the tax code, instead of as “property.” The bill states that the production, possession or use of cryptocurrencies should not be disfavored or discouraged by the tax code, which the current code under Notice 2014-21 apparently does. The bill states that the current plans, which are still awaiting public comments, are “less than optimal for the American people and economy” and it orders the Internal Revenue Service to “issue or revise interim regulations.” This does two things:It treats cryptocurrencies as currency rather than property.It treats cryptocurrencies as neutral until they are converted to fiat currencies.This inclusion in the bill would be groundbreaking news for both individuals and investment communities. If Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrencies, can be isolated until they are monetized, it would be an unprecedented move by a government, allowing value to be stored without penalty. Stockman’s reasoning is simple. He believes that cryptocurrencies should not be taxed as income until they actually become income because, until they are converted, their volatile price puts investors under substantial risk.The bill applies the same standard to profits from currency mining. Mining is a risky venture and miners can put in substantial effort without realizing profit. Stockman believes that coins that are newly mined should also be free from tax, until they are converted to fiat currency, so that miners are not taxed unfairly, which would stifle both mining and the community as a whole.The cryptocurrency protection bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation issued so far by any government. It still has a long way to go before passage and it will certainly be resisted by competitors who can lobby legislators to vote against it. The fight will be an uphill battle, which means that all members of the cryptocurrency community should make their feelings known to Congress.Did you enjoy this article?

MasterCard tells Australia Bitcoin Regulation Necessary for ‘Market Leadership’,William Suberg,12/2/2014 10:16,156,0,"Following Coinjar’s exit from Australia to avoid its tax burden, MasterCard is petitioning lawmakers to enforce greater regulation of digital currencies in the country.A submission by Australasia Division President Eddie Grobler argues the need for “developing an effective regulatory scheme that also protects society against criminal activities and also provides consumers in Australia with safety, stability and reliability when transacting with digital currencies,” local technology portal Computerworld.com.au reports.Grobler describes concerns regarding the reliability of Bitcoin across several spheres, primarily concerned with security and “consumer protection.” Like much of the criticism we have already seen from the financial sector, the submission cites the potential for Bitcoin to be used by criminal entities as a source of major concern. Grobler states:“Contrary to transactions made with a MasterCard product, the anonymity of digital currency transactions enables any party to facilitate the purchase of illegal goods or services; to launder money or finance terrorism; and to pursue other activity that introduces consumer and social harm without detection by regulatory or police authority.”He adds that “the existence of a block chain does nothing to allow law enforcement, other government authorities or the public to identify the real identity of the parties to a digital currency transaction,” citing Mt. Gox as the primary example.While factually less provocative, the bulk of Grobler’s review contains basic arguments reminiscent of those used in a recent report by Citibank to the Swiss government, which argued the “superiority” of paper currency over gold and Bitcoin.Regulation, Grober argues, is necessary “for Australia to take a market leadership position.” This should come in the form of “a requirement that all transactions go through regulated and transparent administrators subject to supervision by Australia authorities (rather than just the current block chain process),” “protections for the consumer (e.g., reversal of unauthorized charges and consumer complaint processes),” and procedures such as KYC, which are already extant in the Bitcoin realm.The recommendations highlight a persistent misunderstanding of the fundamentals of blockchain technology itself from the traditional finance industry. The concepts of centralized transaction monitoring and reversal of charges for a blockchain-based digital currency may indeed strike many as nonsensical.While Citibank even described Bitcoin as “fiat currency,” MasterCard appears at least somewhat more measured in its petition.However, having cited the recommendation by the European Banking Authority (EBA) that “national supervisory authorities discourage credit institutions, payment institutions and e-money institutions from buying, holding and selling digital currencies,” it is telling that Coinjar’s relocation to the UK does not reflect MasterCard’s judgments.Its criticism comes in light of Andreas Antonopoulos speaking out against credit card company policies last week as part of his first visit to Australia at a Bitcoin meetup in Melbourne.“The more you use your [credit] card, the more you give your secret keys to every merchant,” he explained. “They then store them and build giant databases of fifty to sixty million of these secret access codes to everybody’s credit accounts. Then they act with surprise and shock and dismay when a hacker […] steals all credit cards out of their super secret database.”Whether tax authorities will consider altering the need for digital currency exchange and handling entities to comply with general sales tax (GST) may well depend on their continued success in the EU and elsewhere.Regarding the GST, Antonopoulos explained:“By doing regulation in that way, Australia’s not making Bitcoin slow down, what they’re doing is making Bitcoin move out.”Did you enjoy this article?

Decentral Bank Upgrades Citi to Bank 2.0 That Handles Crypto,Carlo C,11/22/2014 17:53,368,0,"The very idea of decentralized Bitcoin and centralized banking seem to be like oil and water: They do not mix. But what if there were such a thing as decentralized banking?Three university students in south Florida might have the solution to truly decentralized banking. Uwe Cerron, Irvin Steve Cardenas, Juan Daniel Alvarado, and Daniel Doherty, a fourth student from another college, came together to become finalists in the Citi Mobile Challenge, a global competition that invited developers to reimagine digital banking and present solutions. The four entrepreneurs have combined training in hyper-scale distributed financial systems, decentralized Bitcoin applications, artificial intelligence algorithms, and developing machine learning. The group was drawn from the two universities — Stone Hill College and Florida International University (FIU) ?— and their company, Master Branch is a startup that competed against 20 other companies for the final prize of US$100,000. For the competition, they named their team Decentral Bank to reflect their ideas.The team was the only university group in the competition, as well as the only team to present a Bitcoin solution that will allow banks to accept Bitcoin without actually managing cryptocurrencies. They accomplished the task by implementing multisig technology. You can view the white paper here.The demo presented to Citi Bank offered services such as deposits, server-processing power, bandwidth, and even digital disk space. They used initiatives such as Storj and MaidSafe as inspiration for providing bandwidth; in essence, a combination of Bank 2.0 with Blockchain 2.0.The network designed by Decentral Bank is a decentralized, off-chain, peer-to-peer design. It brings together individual servers that automatically form voting pools. Once connected, the servers vote when funds are moved in such a way that scheme security is distributed. Anyone can host a server and connect to other servers that are willing to host funds. The solution to the potential of collusion, or the introduction of malware such as badBIOS, is to use proof of guarantee through Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities.Another protection against such potential problems is to attach a deposit to a host, in the amount that they are willing to host. If that amount is 100 bitcoins, then the host is required to provide a guarantee of 100 bitcoins. But the main feature is providing protection against the massive losses that have been coming from single points of failure and centralized exchanges, such as Mt. Gox, Bitcoinica, Poloniex. Like the exchanges, a hosting server has the opportunity to earn fees through the guaranteed, Bitcoin-backed return on the amount that is hosted as protection for the depositor.Finally the team designed a special API that would essentially allow Citi to handle Bitcoin by hosting a server. Through this API, Decentral Bank can issue cryptographic receipts to users, which are then used to sign a 2-of-3 p2sh multisignature transaction, ensuring the delivery of Bitcoin only when a cash payment has been made for the Bitcoin.Did you enjoy this article?

Pennsylvania's Department of Banking and Securities Identifies Digital Currencies as ‘Top Emerging Threat to Investors’,Diana Ngo,11/17/2014 20:25,79,0,"The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, issued a note identifying the 'top emerging threats facing investors in 2015,' where the state agency warns investors of the risks associated with digital currencies.""We are living in an age where traditional financial and investing relationships are being transformed rapidly and sometimes in confusing fashion by technology and innovation,"" said Glenn E. Moyer, Secretary of Banking and Securities, in a statement.""It is especially important that investors fully understand where they are putting their money, and with whom they are investing it.""The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), of which the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities is a member, compiled the said list that includes:On digital currencies, the report explains that while cryptocurrencies, most particularly Bitcoin, have been emerging as trendy way to pay for goods and services, there are numerous risks associated to the trading and the use of digital currencies, including volatility, greater anonymity, and the threats posed by hackers. ""Unscrupulous promoters may be attempting to capitalize on this popularity by illegal offering securities tied to digital currencies,"" continued the report.NASAA's President and Washington Securities Director William Beatty stated:""Many of the top threats facing investors involve new products in classic schemes. Regulators are seeing classic threats to investors morph into new or altered dangers, many fueled by the Internet. Overarching all of these threats are unlicensed agents selling unregistered products to unsuspecting investors.""According to Beatty, unregistered individuals are the most common subject of enforcement actions by regulators. He added:""It cannot be said enough that investors should independently verify any investment opportunity as well as the background of the person and company offering the investment.""In April, the NASAA published a paper called ""Informed Investor Advisory: Virtual Currency."" The organization then defined virtual currency as ""an electronic medium of exchange that is not controlled or backed by a central government or central bank [...][and which] includes cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Ripple or Litecoin."" These currencies, the report says, can be bought or sold through virtual currency exchanges, and are used to purchase goods and services, and stored in ""e-wallets.""The NASAA detailed the risks associated with digital currencies as being subject to minimal regulation, susceptible to cyber-attacks, not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as well as being highly volatile.""Investors in virtual currency will be highly reliant upon unregulated companies that may lack appropriate internal controls and may be more susceptible to fraud and theft than regulated financial institutions,"" said the organization. ""Investors will have to rely upon the strength of their own computer security systems, as well as security systems provided by third parties, to protect their e-Wallets from theft.""Founded in Kansas in 1919, the NASAA is said to be the oldest international investor protection organization, consisting of 67 state, provincial, and territorial securities administrators in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, and Mexico. The organization's role is “to protect consumers who purchase securities or investment advice,” reads the NASAA's website.Did you enjoy this article?

“Regulations Will Be Used to Prevent Mainstream Adoption” – Stefan Molyneux,Amanda B. Johnson,11/13/2014 10:57,183,0,"Love him or hate him (I frequently do both), philosopher Stefan Molyneux makes an interesting point when he says that while many stand to see incredible lifestyle gains from Bitcoin, others stand to lose. And it’s those who stand to lose who will try to foil Bitcoin at every turn.But, Molyneux says, many in the Bitcoin community are mistakenly seeing the blatant attempts to hamper Bitcoin’s growth as positive signs. Who exactly stands to lose by mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency?Well, if they choose not to adapt to new trustless systems, employees in trust-based industries like accounting, lawyering, brokering, and fund management stand to lose their jobs. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—how many of us would trade in our cars for a horse’n’buggy in order to protect the old wagon industry from having to adapt to the automobile? Not too many takers, I would venture.“We should continue to do what we’re doing, to spread horizontally through the economy,” says Molyneux. “But recognize that at some point, there is going to be a conflict of Biblical proportions between decentralized, encrypted currency mechanisms. . . and the entrenched financial interests.”Bitcoin stands to present a massive shift in resource allocation, especially in North America, where the trust-based sector makes up a whopping one-fifth of the economy.Molyneux theorizes that the recent demands that have come from government organizations like FinCEN are aimed more at protecting these trust-based industries than “protecting consumers.” And why would they do that?He says it all comes down to favors and friends:“The financial sector is the biggest single contributor to politicians, at least in the United States.”So if trust-based industries give more cash to politicians than anyone else, how would that influence these so-called regulations? Molyneux continues:“They’re not going to try to take out [Bitcoin’s] revving engine with an airstrike. They’re just going to try to throw little bits of sand in it, little bits of sand, until most people find it too difficult and cumbersome to use. That is the great danger.”Could Bitcoin—the instant and frictionless network—become too cumbersome to use? Consider the fact that FinCEN insists that businesses dealing in Bitcoin are to be called “money transmitters” and must acquire an additional “licenses” to continue operations.These licenses cost scads of money, require expensive bond policies and necessitate the employment of additional compliance staff members, not to mention lengthy wait periods (time is money). This is all highly cumbersome. Gone would be the days of approaching a small-time merchant to say, “You’re interested in accepting Bitcoin? I can help you get set up for it in about ten seconds!”Furthermore, if in the name of “KYC” and “AML” compliance businesses adopt identity-tracking software like the one proposed by ID3, customers would be further inconvenienced by the need to create an online “biometric and behavioral” identity before spending their Bitcoin. This too is cumbersome and makes fiat look more appealing than ever.Molyneux continues:“If they make it more and more difficult for honest, law-abiding citizens to use Bitcoin, then it will displace itself into the ‘black market,’ and then they’ll say, ‘See, we told you it was going to be used for crime! Let’s get back to fiat currency.’”While Gavin Andresen and many others see regulation as some sort of sign of mainstream acceptance, Molyneux counters that it’s actually these cumbersome regulations which will prevent the mainstream from using Bitcoin. It will simply become too expensive and time-consuming.Andreas Antonopoulos has agreed with Molyneux’s argument, repeatedly citing the Red Flag Act in England at the turn of the 20th century. This legislation put cumbersome regulations on the use of automobiles in the country, and as a result, the automobile industry died in England and moved elsewhere—America in particular.If history shows us anything, it’s that the path of least resistance is what most people will choose in their everyday dealings. Right now, Bitcoin remains the financial path of least resistance. But Molyneux argues that if U.S. regulators prevail, it won’t stay that way.Did you enjoy this article?

The Winklevoss Brothers Say Their ETF Is 'Still Going Through the Regulatory Process',Cointelegraph,11/9/2014 18:34,321,0,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss discuss the state of their Bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, with Bloomberg TV at the Money20/20 conference held last week in Las Vegas.The Winklevoss brothers filed plans for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust in mid-2013, and while the exchange-traded fund (ETF) is still under review from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the brothers assured Bloomberg TV's Erik Schatzker in an interview led during the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, that the ETF is ""alive and well.""Tyler Winklevoss explained:""We’re still going through the regulatory process [...] Any ETF is a long process to get approved and, in this particular case, we’re dealing with a very innovative product, which is a digital asset which has not been done before.""""There has been no evidence that the ETF was going any slower or faster than any other ETF,"" said Tyler Winklevoss.He added that the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will be geared as physically-backed commodities ETFs, which give investors access to the investment exposure, but doesn't give access to the actual asset.The twins told Schatzker they owned roughly 1% of the total amount of bitcoins in circulation, and said they haven't sold any yet.The interview concluded with the brothers' financial participations in numerous American startups, including logistics and transportation startups Shyp and Cargomatic. Cameron said:""We love meeting entrepreneurs and finding them at early stages and helping them build their companies.

The LocalBitcoins P2P platform registered an all-time trading high of $17.5 mln last week, and other local platform volumes have quadrupled as well.The rush for investors and Bitcoin holders to either buy or sell has driven them into these generally lesser-used platforms. As exchanges like ViaBTC shutter, the Bitcoin that they had previously been holding is being withdrawn into the open market and used via smaller P2P platforms.As with other nations where governments are making reckless financial decisions, the Chinese price for Bitcoin is going for a premium against the exchange price. Currently, the price is set at a 20 percent premium vs. the exchange pricing, since the P2P system is allowing consumers to access and use their coin.Other countries are also facing similar Bitcoin crises, as hyperinflation, massive debt ratios, and poor fiscal policies lead citizens to embrace Bitcoin as an alternative solution. The safety, relative stability and overall positive outlook for Bitcoin has produced sizable premiums on other local exchanges as well.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #P2P    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Tradings    #Banned Bitcoin    #ViaBTC  
South African Retailers Catching Bitcoin Bug,Darryn Pollock,9/26/2017 15:30,16451,447,"A few days after Pick n Pay, one of South Africa’s largest grocery and food stores, announced it would be testing out Bitcoin in one of its stores, there are rumblings of other retailers wanting to join the bandwagon.OneDayOnly, a major eCommerce player in the country, has announced that they are looking at accepting Bitcoin. This also follows on from Takealot.com who have been accepting Bitcoin for a number of years though the PayFast service.OneDayOnly’s expansion into potential using Bitcoin is coincidentally being announced at the same time as Pick n Pay’s decision for the eCommerce store which they’re looking to expand.The company has doubled its revenue year-on-year for five years, and had to move warehouses in Cape Town and Johannesburg to accommodate its expansion.“We’re offering more products, more big brands, and even greater deals and savings,” OneDayOnly said.The company has grown from an operation with 40 staff members in 2016, to employing nearly 100 people in 2017.With this expansion, OneDayOnly admit that they would like to keep moving forward, as well as innovating, and with South Africa seemingly pretty progressive in terms of its Bitcoin adoption and regulation, it could be a viable option.The announcement that a major chain like Pick n Pay was looking into Bitcoin sent ripples through the South African Bitcoin fraternity, as well as the world’s, as there was much positive feelings about it.Retailers have been skeptical about digital currencies and their implementation, but Pick n Pay’s Richard van Rensburg, deputy chief executive, says:“Accepting cryptocurrency holds the promise of being both frictionless and safe, and therefore has the potential to be a game-changer for the retail industry. Our pilot resulted in a transaction that was safe. There is no cash risk and no card fraud risk.”For a limited period, customers at the store on Pick n Pay’s head office campus in Cape Town were able to use Bitcoin to buy goods and services. The checkout process involved scanning a QR code using a Bitcoin wallet app on customers’ smartphones.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Africa    #Bitcoin Adoption  
"Hong Kong Gripped by Cryptomania, ICO Fever as China Bitcoin Ban Persists",Jon Buck,9/26/2017 9:15,18192,317,"The hardline stance against cryptocurrencies and exchanges taken by the central Chinese government has had some negative impact on cryptocurrency markets in recent weeks. However, Chinese government regulation has not quelled interest in Blockchain technology solutions in the small island state of Hong Kong.Hong Kong, known for its substantial banking and shipping industries, is seeking to make the transition to new domestic platforms for business and is hoping that Blockchain technology will be the tool to make that possible.The Hong Kong government is seeking to make the leap. Charles d’Haussy, the fintech lead at government economic agency InvestHK, said:“Blockchain is a very high priority for us. There is hype, and there is the fast grab of money with ICOs in some cases. But what we are looking at building here in Hong Kong is an infrastructure for new businesses and existing businesses, to make sure the technology and innovations remain a key enabler for financial sector growth.”Meanwhile, ICOs in the country are cropping up (for example Dragon Corp., who hopes to raise $500 mln from its upcoming ICO), as the city presents a means for companies to have a hub in east Asia without the crippling regulations that China just imposed.However, the government is not simply opening the doors completely. The local Securities and Futures Department recently issued a statement warning consumers to do due diligence before investing, and warned owners that some ICOs may be considered securities.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #China    #Hong Kong    #Cryptocurrencies    #Asia  
"SEC Announces Creation of “Cyber Unit” With Broad Powers, Including ICO Oversight",David Dinkins,9/26/2017 3:35,24801,523,"Today the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a press release about their creation of a dedicated “Cyber Unit.” Among other things, this unit will exercise some oversight over digital currencies.The SEC stated:The Cyber Unit will focus the Enforcement Division’s substantial cyber-related expertise on targeting cyber-related misconduct, such as:The new Cyber Unit will clearly have significant authority if all these are to fall under its purview. The third bullet point is most relevant to the cryptocurrency markets. The SEC is officially taking on the role of policing both ICOs and the “distributed ledger technology” sector.Simply giving oneself enforcement power over “distributed ledger technology” seems overly broad. Depending on how the SEC (and perhaps the courts) define this term, the SEC could have wide latitude to investigate users of digital currencies.Following this summer’s ruling that Ethereum’s “TheDAO” project was in fact a security offering, it is no surprise the SEC is taking a rather proactive approach with respect to regulating ICOs.The ICO boom has been unprecedented, raising over $1.5 bln in 2017 alone. Many of these ICOs are either outright scams or are the result of some vague ideas in the head of a few would-be entrepreneurs.Some on the /r/BitcoinMarkets subreddit have expressed their pleasure at the SEC’s apparent plan to get tough on ICOs. User amygdala9 stated:“I dislike any regulatory oversight. Period. Though I'm pleasantly surprised at the SEC's chosen course of action here. They might even manage to deter a blatant exit scammer/fraudster or two from preying on idiots.”Other points of interest in the SEC’s announcement include the first bullet point, which states that the SEC will be watching out for pump-and-dump schemes carried out via “electronic and social media.” Additionally, for digital currency users who carry out illegal activities on the Darkweb, bullet point four indicates that the SEC will be looking out for that conduct as well.On the whole, the SEC seems to be taking a balanced approach to digital currencies. Given that many ICOs promise “tokens” that sound a great deal like “shares,” it’s unsurprising that the SEC would be interested in potential securities’ violations from that area.Careful enforcement could prevent retail investors from being fleeced while not destroying the fledgeling ICO market entirely. Likewise, oversight over “distributed ledger technology” violations could give the SEC more power to track down and prosecute alleged scammers like Josh Garza.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #ICO    #USA    #Tokens    #Digital Currency  
Shanghai Losing Cryptocurrency Trading Market,Willie Tan,9/24/2017 10:30,24322,403,"As reported by CCTV news, 17 trading platforms will stop cryptocurrency trading in Shanghai. BTCChina, Binance, SZZC, Lhang, ETCWin, Bitekuang, 51SZZC, Hanbiwang, Bitbill, 19800Net, FreeWillex, ICOAGE, 91ICO, ICOrace, ICOfox, ICORaise and ICO17 have publicly announced that they are no longer involved in ICO operations and have proposed plans to exit from the market.According to a report by the National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security of Technology of China, in  January 2017 up to July 18, there were 65 completed ICO projects in China totalling RMB 2,616 bln worth of investment. Before 2017, there were only five completed ICO projects.On Sept. 4, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued an official announcement explaining that ICOs are a form of public fundraising that are yet to be approved, and illegal. It called for all ICO activities to be stopped immediately. Later on, the government of Shanghai city and Shanghai municipality, as well as Shanghai PBOC headquarters called for all digital currency trading platforms to stop trading by Sept. 30. Subsequently, the Shanghai government would supervise refunding activities to ensure that investors could get their funds back.More than 90 percent of ICO projects have been verified and refunded. In order to ensure a smooth operation, the top management of these platforms are asked to stay in Shanghai to cooperate with the refunding activities.Some investors are refusing refunds, one of the main reasons being that the launched ICOs are being traded overseas, and the investors believe they are entitled to own the tokens. Moreover, the prices of the tokens are increasing, so investors do not want refunds at the same price as when the ICOs were first launched. Regarding this, Shanghai regulators explained that the core principle is to protect investors’ rights and benefits. They urge for the investors and platforms to communicate better.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Shanghai    #Tradings    #Markets    #ICO    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China    #Investments  
How Shanghai Govt Came To Forcing All Bitcoin Trading to Stop: The Insider Story,Willie Tan,9/23/2017 13:55,35559,413,"Sept. 22, The Paper news agency reported that the Chinese regulators not only banned the exchange between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the Chinese Yuan, but they also called for all trading of cryptocurrency to any fiat currency to end.This carries the implication that all exchanges have effectively been banned.Furthermore, the regulators in Shanghai have asked for the top management of the exchanges, including the executives, directors, finance team and technical team members, to stay in Shanghai to cooperate for the clean-up activity.Previously, the Beijing regulators still did not call for trading in all fiat currency to be stopped. However, it was noticed that on Sept. 15 both OKCoin and HuoBi first announced that all cryptocurrency trading in Chinese Yuan will end. The next day, both exchanges modified their announcements respectively to include a plan to end all cryptocurrency trading activities.The main reason for closing down the exchanges, as authorities tell the public, is because Bitcoin price fluctuates greatly, it is risky and it can be a way for criminal activities to take place. Besides, Bitcoin trading platforms do not have a qualified regulatory system and won’t give sufficient protection to investors, regulators believe.In May this year, when Bitcoin price went above RMB 8,000, PBOC arranged talks with the three largest crypto exchanges.They allowed for the Bitcoin exchanges to handle issues regarding development on their own, so the clean-up activities were carried out correspondingly. Later on, the Bitcoin exchanges were instructed to charge trading fees, to prevent speculating activities, to stop financing services, to implement strict Know-Your-Customers (KYC) policies, to take measures to prevent money laundering and to report back to the regulation department in a timely manner.In September this year,  the regulators called to end all forms of digital currency trading and to return the customer’s funds into accounts that can be audited.An audit mechanism was then to be established to audit every account to prevent diversion or embezzlement of cryptocurrency funds. All Bitcoin exchanges were instructed to halt new accounts registration, to lower the number of investors and to plan to their own exits from cryptocurrency trading.When asked about the situation regarding ICO, a source with the regulators explained:“If a certain ICO’s sole purpose was to raise funds, it will be okay if the funds were returned to the investors, and the case is closed.But if the ICO was used as a way for money laundering, then it should be handled as how it is supposed to be doing just that.”When asked about how the ICO funds return is being handled, the insider explained that most importantly, the platforms, project owners and investors can come to an agreement and the government’s responsibility is to urge and supervise the return of capital and to protect the rights of the investors.‘For some projects, there are disagreements between the trading platforms and the investors. For example, some tokens were already trading on the exchanges, and the prices had increased from 1.5 cents to five cents, yet how much should be returned to the investors is not decided by the government. If the parties could not come to an agreement, they should take the legal approach to settle the case.’When asked about government’s initiative to block access to all foreign platforms, the person informed that as cryptocurrency is a decentralized system, the regulators are having difficulties in the technical aspects. Thus they can only control from the movement of funds.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Shanghai    #Bitcoin Price    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Yuan    #OKCoin    #HuoBi  
CEO of JP Morgan Chase Warns Govts Will Ban Bitcoin; Crypto ‘Worth Nothing’,Jon Buck,9/23/2017 12:00,49944,1158,"In another statement that will certainly have cryptophiles fuming, Jamie Dimon, the erstwhile CEO of JP Morgan Chase Bank, was quoted in an interview in New Delhi India saying that cryptocurrencies ‘to me are worth nothing.’Dimon was serious in his warning that as cryptocurrencies grow, governments will begin to control them, and will eventually ban them, throwing those who buy and sell them into prison. The commentary does not reflect the wider governmental acceptance of Bitcoin in the news but seems to be more in line with the Chinese government rhetoric.During the interview, when Dimon commented that cryptocurrencies are created ‘out of thin air’ with no value, the reporter tried to point out that the same can be said of fiat currencies. This is especially true in an inflationary economy like Venezuela, where cash is printed in massive volumes.Dimon, however, was not to be gainsaid, and rapidly fired back that ‘legal tender’ means that ‘you have to take it.’  Dimon made it clear that dollars, for example, have value because they are backed by a government, as opposed to Bitcoin, which is backed by consensus among users, saying:""Creating money out of thin air without government backing is very different from money with government backing.”Apparently, however, Dimon does recognize that both dollars and Bitcoins are made out of thin air.The comments follow his previous condemnation of Bitcoin as a ‘fraud’ which was met with some vitriol from the cryptocurrency community. One company has even filed a suit against Dimon for adverse business practice.Ironically, however, after his initial comments, news spread that JP Morgan had purchased Bitcoin at the lowest point immediately after Dimon’s comments. Clearly, if governments are to ban the cryptocurrency, JP Morgan Chase itself would take a major hit.",38,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #JPMorgan    #Jamie Dimon    #Bubble    #Cryptocurrencies    #China    #Venezuela  
China's Miners on Tenterhooks as Exchanges Soon Shut,Darryn Pollock,9/22/2017 17:10,20471,278,"While there has been nothing officially done on the legality of Bitcoin mining, amid bans striking other parts of the cryptocurrency market such as ICOs and exchanges, there is still fear and uncertainty.Miners in China have always managed to turn a profit, with the country’s low electricity cost and seemingly friendly approach to mining and cryptocurrency. However, as China takes a hard-nosed line to cryptos, miners are debating if it is a good business to be in.China holds sway in terms of the hashrate for Bitcoin mining, and besides the more well known pools such as Antpool and F2Pool, they may be under threat if the crackdown continues.The real issue is for those looking to capitalise on mining possibilities in China, as now that formerly lucrative business has a cloud hanging over it.A recent example is that of Wang Hongyi who, as explained by the South China Morning Post, was looking to open a mining farm with over 1,000 computers in a remote corner of Northwest China.Wang’s planned farm will cost about 10 mln yuan ($1.52 mln) to set up. Initially he was confident he could turn a profit, because the site is located next to a hydropower station, and that will cut electricity fees – a key operating cost – to about 0.25 yuan per kWh.But after the Chinese government began an all-out war on Bitcoin and other digital currencies last week, Wang is having second thoughts about opening his mining farm.“If we start this business and the government says it’s illegal, then it will be impossible for us to recover our investment,” Wang told.Of course, for Wang, there is huge risk in diving into a mining pool without any assurance that it will still be legal in a few weeks or months. The concern extends further to those who are already vested.Yang Haipo, chief executive of ViaBTC, said he also has concerns about the future of Bitcoin mining in China.ViaBTC has two Bitcoin mines controlling seven percent of the world’s total Bitcoin mining capabilities, and plans to close its trading platform at the end of this month.Without revenues from trading, ViaBTC is now looking to its mining business to make ends meet.“Technically, China can’t ban Bitcoin traffic, we have our own sync network. But if the China government says mining is illegal, we are f***ed,” Yang tweeted.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Mining    #ViaBTC    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Banned Bitcoin

We have enough liquidity to support all of our customers’ withdrawals,” Yang Haipo, chief executive of the exchange said.ViaBTC have heeded orders from Beijing that called for the cease of Bitcoin trading after a small period of speculation following the ICO ban. Other large firms such as BTCChina, OKCoin and Huobi will also close their doors on the Chinese market.The later two exchanges were given leeway by the Chinese government to operate until the end of October. Upon the closure of them later this year, however, the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market will officially be terminated.There is no mistaking that the news from China has caused a huge ripple in the market.Bitcoin prices have soared over the past 12 months, jumping from about $595 to an all-time high of $4,950 on Sep. 1. Since China announced its ICO ban and ordered the closure of exchange platforms, Bitcoin prices have plunged, trading at about $3,663 towards the end of this week.This hardline stance from one of the bigger Bitcoin trading, mining and using countries has seen much of the exuberance around the recent boom lessen as many other countries wait and see what the future holds.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ViaBTC    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #ICO    #BTCChina    #OKCoin    #Huobi    #Ripple  
Former US Futures Commission Chair Says Regulation Solves Bitcoin Volatility: CNBC,Jon Buck,9/22/2017 9:40,23506,406,"The recent weeks of Bitcoin volatility, with Bitcoin price hitting an all-time high of $5,000, only to plummet back below $3,000, and then stabilize near $4,000, are a signal of what Bitcoin really needs - regulation. This, at least, is the opinion of the former US Trading Commissioner Bart Chilton in an article published on CNBC. Chilton has been chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the financial regulatory agency tasked with overseeing the U.S. derivatives markets.The former financial regulator stresses that Bitcoin has a ‘big blind spot’ in its lack of regulation, and the government crackdown by China should send a message to Bitcoin investors and developers that regulation is needed. Chilton says that the Bitcoin community needs visionary leadership who can shift the focus of Bitcoin development away from the anti-government stance it has taken, to a more regulated environment, producing stability. He said:“Rather than waiting for governments to take actions that thwart the development of digital currencies, they should lead efforts to put in place appropriate regulatory oversight for these new and innovative financial technologies.” This perspective runs contrary, at least in part, to the founding vision of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies of a non-governmental digital currency.Recent comments by Julian Assange reflect a more traditional Bitcoin perspective regarding the dangers of governmental power and regulation.",22,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #CFTC    #CNBC    #China    #Bitcoin Price    #USA  
Malaysia Legalizing Bitcoin? Bank Negara Issuing Guidelines for Crypto,Jon Buck,9/21/2017 10:40,41221,1292,"A recent statement by Malaysia’s Bank Negara governor that Malaysia may be the next to open its doors to Bitcoin has generated substantial interest in the cryptocurrency community. This would undoubtedly increase the use of Bitcoin by many millions, as residents within the country would have access to relatively cheap payment remittance platforms that were otherwise non-existent.According to one source, this change could come as quickly as November after the meeting that is to determine the central bank’s stance:“During this meeting, it will be decided how the economy should be positioned in regards to cryptocurrencies. It appears this will also be the final meeting among regulators to determine the future of Bitcoin and altcoins in Malaysia moving forward.”The government is following a trajectory that has been adopted by a number of other governments in recent months. Australia and Hong Kong have both issued statements indicating a generally positive outlook for Bitcoin, ICOs, and cryptocurrencies generally.The Malaysia’s Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim addressed the Global Symposium on Developing Financial Institutions saying:“We hope to come out with guidelines on cryptocurrencies before the end of the year: in particular, those relating to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. We want to ensure that there are clear guidelines for those who want to participate in this sector.”While not an explicit statement, it is suggesting that the government will legalize Bitcoin as a currency, the statement indicates that, after adding guidelines, the country will allow its citizens to participate in the cryptocurrency market legally.Malaysia has already been seen as an excellent location for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and a legalization would create a mass of new investment into the country.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Malaysia    #Banks  
People’s Bank of China Think Tank: Cryptocurrencies Are Realistic Threat,John Patrick Mullin,9/20/2017 21:15,26224,441,"In what seems like a never ending stream of bad news for cryptos coming out of China, a new statement condemning cryptos within the Chinese financial system has been issued by a leading PBOC think tank.Image: Asia TimesWith ICOs being banned, crypto exchanges being shut down, and rumors of putting up the “Great Firewall” against foreign exchanges, markets have been getting hit with their fair share of negative news coming out of China.  However, after dropping almost 30 percent from the all-time high last week, it seems as if markets have begun to accept negative crypto stories from China as the norm.Perhaps, they might also believe that China will re-open to cryptos and ICOs after the nineteenth party congress.  However, in a recent interview, Zhou Ziheng, an associate research fellow at The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Institute of Finance, all but dispelled these ideas.After talking about the rise of cryptocurrencies, and quasi digital currencies, he goes on to say:“Supervision authorities must take stringent measures to limit and ensure that the real monetary and financial system remains stable.”When asked if whether or not, once the situation has stabilized, the authorities will reopen private digital currency transactions, Zhou Ziheng again had a negative outlook.He goes on to claim that cryptocurrencies pose realistic threats to financial stability, and that they must be terminated - with the only solution being to replace private cryptos with fiat cryptos issued by PBOC.Is this the end of cryptocurrencies in China?

The release regarding the end of the double taxation standard included the following:“Currently, consumers who use digital currency can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency, and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.

"Despite China’s Ban, People Are Still Eager to Participate in ICOs",Iyke Aru,9/19/2017 23:40,17762,658,"Minimal launching costs and the ability to solicit crowdfunding from virtually anyone in the world with ease have been identified as the main reasons why startups are embracing the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) model as a fundraising method.Whether one represents an established organization or a group of college graduates with an innovative idea and little start-up capital, ICOs offer a level the playing field.President and Host at Blockchain TV, Jason Cassidy, explains that promising projects are taking the ICO route over the traditional venture capital path because of the low barriers to entry.Cassidy notes that the rules of engagement for ICOs are often set by the project team, giving them considerably more control. This is the opposite of the venture capital space, where the investor usually dictates the flow of negotiations.He elaborates, saying another important factor in the ICO boom is the relatively low cost to launch a successful crowdsale. ICOs are also raise capital much more quickly than the traditional funding routes, making it clear why projects often prefer Initial Coin Offerings.However, Cassidy notes that as the industry grows, the level of difficulty for carrying out ICOs will increase due to imminent regulations by governments and institutions.Cassidy says:“Regulations are being put in place across the globe currently to bring a level of transparency and protection to the ICO model. As time goes on, more and more countries will bring forth regulations and the barriers of entry will increase, as will the quality of the ICO offerings that abide by the rules of those jurisdictions. Locales such as Zurich and Singapore are likely to become havens for ICOs given their friendly stance towards not only the crowdfunding model but the underlying technology itself.”Earlier this month, the Chinese government announced a ban on companies that were carrying out ICOs within its borders, ordering them to refund investors who contributed to such projects.This action by the Chinese government had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market as the prices of token dropped sharply and many companies had to adjust their plans and programs.Even though the event came as a surprise to many in the industry, China-based Partner at Cryptocrest Dana Coe tells Cointelegraph that the development was nothing out of the ordinary:""To anyone who is familiar with Chinese law, this move to ban fundraising via ICOs comes as no surprise at all. China has long frowned upon ""fund raising"" activities within it's borders. I've consulted for several successful ICOs over the past months, and when they asked about bringing their ICOs to China, my advice was, ‘Forget it. They will land on you like a ton of bricks if you are perceived as doing free-lance fundraising in PRC.”He tells Cointelegraph that in China, events such as ICOs are illegal and the penalties are harsh.According to Coe, the Chinese government has actually taken a rather soft touch in allowing these ICOs to just refund their customers and walk away. He notes that the fallout from China may be perceived as a setback, but given the possibility of shady ICOs harming the interests of consumers, and the reputation of cryptocurrencies as a whole, it is good to clean up the space. Coe elaborates:“I expect some sort of registration framework may be proposed for future ICO-like offerings. This way at the very least a responsible party is known to the regulators. People want to participate in ICOs, they can still do so, it is just they will have to be more circumspect about it by using only crypto.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #China    #Government    #Jason Cassidy

Mexico is also hoping, in this bill, to ensure financial stability and defend against money laundering and financing of extremists.Mexico will be joining a small list of countries, which include the UK and the US who have actively sought to regulate not only cryptocurrencies, but also fintech companies.The hope for fintech companies is to try and crack a massive potential market as over half of Mexico’s 120 mln strong population are bank account-less.""This legislation recognizes the need that a sector as dynamic as that of technological innovation needs a regulatory framework that allows authorities to mitigate risks and allow for growth in a competitive environment,"" the bill draft says.The Bill proposes to set out a clear set of rules pertaining to the running of fintech companies which will help reduce costs and drive competition in a sector that includes crowd-funders and payment firms.Additionally, there will be a section aimed at regulating companies that operate with digital currencies, such as Bitcoin.

"Newly Appointed PBOC Governor Once Called Bitcoin ‘Inspiring’, Praised Its Accessibility",Helen Partz,3/19/2018 22:40,30277,419,"Yi Gang, who was “unexpectedly” appointed to serve as new governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on March 19, could soften the institution’s stance towards cryptocurrencies, given his previously reported positive views on Bitcoin (BTC).According to reports from Chinese media, Yi spoke about Bitcoin at the end of 2013, when he said that the major cryptocurrency cannot be legally recognized by the PBOC in the near future. At the same time, he recognized the transactional potential of Bitcoin, adding that, “ordinary people have the freedom to participate.”In contrast with the negative stance of PBOC’s deputy governor Pan Gongsheng in December 2017, who argued that Bitcoin “will die”, Yi stated at the time that Bitcoin is “inspiring”, and that it will remain a subject of public attention in the long term.Yi will take the post of former PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan as decided by the National People’s Congress. On March 9, Zhou said that the development of digital currency is “technologically inevitable,” but the banking system still does not accept cryptocurrency as payment.According to Tommy Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore, Yi is one of “the main driver[s] to China's [economic] reform in the past few years."" Taking into account both Yi’s support of economic reforms and favorable stance towards crypto, the new PBOC appointment could signal the possibility of a new regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies in China.For now, China continues its hardline stance on cryptocurrencies, with bans on crypto-fiat exchanges, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and since last month, a ban on all foreign cryptocurrency exchanges.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Markets    #Investments    #Tradings    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Cryptocurrencies    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China  
"Hong Kong Securities Regulator Shuts Down ICO, Makes Company Issue Refunds",Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/19/2018 20:16,16717,226,"The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has stopped Black Cell Technology’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on the grounds that the offering constituted an unregistered Collective Investment Scheme (CIS), according to a SFC website bulletin posted today, March 19.Black Cell must now refund Hong Kong investors of their investments in the token, which would support a mobile app call “Krops,” a marketplace for listing agricultural products.Black Cell promoted its ICO on its website, telling investors that their investments would finance the development of the mobile app and give token holders the rights to equity shares of Black Cell, a practice that the SFC considers a CIS and thus a “security”, thus needing prior registration with the regulator before being sold to investors.The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission had  filed a cease-and-desist order against four companies associated with Black Cell and Krops in late January of this year, also for offering unlicensed securities in the form of the Krops token.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also taken a strict line on ICOs adhering to securities laws, with SEC head Jay Clayton recently noting that every ICO he has seen should be considered a security, and needs to be registered with the SEC before being sold to US investors.The Praetorian Group, a “Cryptocurrency Real Estate Investment Vehicle,” (CREIV) may launch the first SEC-registered ICO in the US, after it was reported earlier this month that they filed their coin offering as a security.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Hong Kong    #ICO    #SEC    #USA    #Government  
Blockchain Technology Takes Hold in Israel: Expert Take,Selva Ozelli,3/18/2018 20:19,28004,541,"In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation, and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to a.mcqueen@cointelegraph.comBlockchain technology - designed to reduce fraud and corruption - is being widely used by Israeli politicians and business.   The Government of Israel promotes the policy of open government with the understanding that recent innovations in communication and information technologies could allow a significant improvement in parliamentary democracy. This approach fosters informed policy-making processes, improves governmental services and has the potential to strengthen the trust between citizens and government.The Israeli government funds, collaborates and partners with businesses as well as educational institutions in fostering and continuously developing innovative technologies and science.A startup Blockchain technology company, CoaIiChain, is designing an interactive political platform that promotes the policies of an open government and eliminates the communication gap between the elector and the elected. During interactive discourse between citizens and government, the platform produces heat maps and graphs conveying the citizen's interests, allowing politicians, in turn, to respond in real-time to their constituent’s queries. The data collected by the system traces the frequency of corporate influence and payments made to politicians. The system also utilizes smart contracts for enforcing campaign commitments made by politicians – such as budgets proposals, policies. The launch of a beta version is scheduled for release in Q1 2018, and the full version & Blockchain integrated app by the end of 2018 according to the company’s website.  In Colombia, the Democracy Earth Foundation launched the digital, Blockchain-powered voting platform Plebiscito Digital (Digital Plebiscite) and worked with several civil society organizations to allow Colombians abroad to cast symbolic votes through the platform, and Sierra Leone has already held world’s first Blockchain-powered Presidential vote.Israel ranks as the world’s tenth most innovative country and ahead of the US according to Bloomberg.  This is because it has one of the highest percentages of engineers and scientists in the workforce, and the largest number of tech-startups producing cutting-edge technologies. A tech rise fueled by the smartphone electronics industry has significantly accelerated the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in commercial applications. Drones initially came into existence for the sole purpose of reaching and traversing areas where it was arduous for man to maneuver. Over time, their use expanded to military applications, for example to get a birds-eye view of complex operational missions and perform intelligence, surveillance and, reconnaissance – like the Iranian spy drone that Israel shot down in Syria. With time, demand, and further progressions, drones began to be used for a variety of other purposes - including for inspections, surveys, surveillance, security, delivery and wireless internet access.Israel is a leading drone exporter. Airobotics, a startup company based in Petah Tikva, Israel, is the world’s first company to obtain authorization from the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel (CAAI) to fly commercial, fully unmanned drones in their nation’s airspace.To track/secure commercial drone flights and deliveries, another startup company Applied Blockchain founded by Adi Ben-Ari, developed the Blockchain drone registry. “The Blockchain platform brings together drone operators, drone manufacturers and regulators together with a single source of truth. Flight path data captured by a drone during a flight can be uploaded onto the same shared ledger and represented visually on an interactive map. As this data is attached to a registered drone, aviation authorities can plot the flights of a specific drone, all drones of a given operator, or even all drones from a specific manufacturer, all on a single map and in real time to ensure the safe interoperation of UAVs within the airspace. This access to data is a paradigm shift from legacy-based systems, which inherently rely upon a single trusted party to maintain the data and provide the correct level of access to users” Ben-Ari explained.As it has a technologically advanced market economy, Israel has joined the growing list of countries planning to launch a state-backed cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are currently characterized as an asset/property by the Bank of Israel (BOI), Israel’s central bank. The Israeli Finance Ministry and BOI’s interest in promoting a state-backed cryptocurrency is aimed at minimizing risks of corruption, money laundering and tax evasion offenses.  This is especially important, in light of recent corruption investigations that have resulted in formal charges brought against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s aides.Israel still has limited banking, regulatory and financial infrastructure due to its market size.  Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi lead the industry in a duopoly with support from the local regulator. While Bank Hapoalim has embraced Blockchain technology, the Israeli Supreme Court decided that Bank Leumi was prohibited from limiting the bank accounts of companies associated with the crypto/Blockchain industry. The Supreme Court in Israel has also rejected the appeal of a law banning binary options.Israel is a Fintech startup nation with many disruptive ventures such as Bancor, Zen, DAGlabs, which is developing technology to improve crypto scaling issues.  While currently there are no initial coin offering (ICO) regulations, the head of the Israeli Securities Authority (ISA) has established a committee tasked with assessing the need for ICO regulations in Israel.The Israel Tax Authority has classified a cryptocurrency as an asset/property (tax circular 5/2018), and therefore the sale of it becomes a taxable event as a barter transaction giving rise to a capital gains tax to be measured according to the value of the assets exchanged, according to Yitzchak Chikorel CPA, Tax Partner and the head of the International Tax Department at Deloitte Israel.If a cryptocurrency is held by its owner as a capital asset (like an investment), then the gain will be classified as a capital gain and taxed at a rate of about 46 percent (23 percent capital gains tax, 30 percent dividends tax) for corporations and about 25 percent for individuals.   If the gain from the disposal of the cryptocurrency is considered to be part of business activity, such as mining, an individual will be taxed at progressive rates that may reach 47 percent, and corporations at 46 percent. Foreign investors may be exempt from tax based on tax treaties, in case there are no exemptions, they will be taxed as Israeli companies or Israeli individuals. In some cases, consideration received by an ICO issuing entity from the investors on the day of the ICO is not taxed on the same day but is deferred instead.The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Israel    #Taxes    #FinTech  
Israel: Steps Toward Cryptocurrency Support?,Nikolai Kuznetsov,3/18/2018 2:37,60697,559,"The views expressed here are the author’s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com.In terms of technological innovation, Israel has been labeled by some as “The Startup Nation” with Israeli ventures raising over $5 billion in capital in 2017. This is almost 10% of China’s yearly fundraising total. While there’s a number of popular applications, platforms, and products including USB flash drives, the Waze navigation app, SodaStream carbonation machines, the country has set its foot in the crypto industry as well.Back in 2017, Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank, partnered with Microsoft to create a Blockchain-powered platform to “make the process of signing up guarantors simple and quicker.” And in February 2018, the Israeli Tax Authority (ITA) stated that cryptocurrencies will be taxed by the capital gains as properties.On February 26, 2018, the country took it even further, when the Israeli Supreme Court handed down a decision that would temporarily block Leumi Bank, limiting a local broker, Bits of Gold, from facilitating the sale of cryptocurrency.Though many were quick to laud the temporary ruling as ‘precedent-setting,’ it still leaves ample room for further developments. The judge ruling the case, Anat Baron, said that her decision was “not intended to harm the bank’s rights to analyze with specificity every transaction that takes place with the bank account or to take any actions that are related to minimizing risks.” This likely means cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges putting transparency first will be regarded as lawful—for now.The Supreme Court of Israel in session (The times of Israel)Founder and CEO of Bits of Gold Yuval Roash sees this decision as justified, saying,“Regulation is one of the things that has been important to us since the beginning. From the very beginning, we saw the problem with Bitcoin in terms of its anonymous characteristics, and we wanted to receive a currency service certificate—and we received it in August 2013.”This is significant progress from December of last year, when a Tel Aviv district court ruled in favor of Leumi Bank, who had refused service to Bits of Gold because of Bitcoin’s inability to meet anti-money laundering standards. Bank Leumi had also been piggybacking on the Bank of Israel’s June labeling of exchanges as “websites that facilitate gambling transactions”, which is a sore spot for Israel especially. The country proved to be careful about upsetting the balance within its borders, and even blocked popular ride-sharing application Uber from an Israeli debut.After examining the last five years of Bits of Golds’ operations, Judge Baron determined Leumi’s previous assumption that violations of the law would occur if Bitcoin were left unchecked were false.In relation to the ruling, Yair Geva, head of the Hi-Tech Department of Israeli law firm Herzog, Fox & Ne’eman, remarked:“It should be emphasized that the Court did not rule on the fundamental question—which has not yet been decided—whether Bank Leumi is entitled to refuse banking services for cryptocurrency trading. Although the final decision is still pending, it seems that this recent verdict of the Supreme Court will continue to give tailwinds to the tremendous growth of the crypto industry in Israel particularly, and to hi-tech as well as the financial industry in general. One of the reasons for this is that the Supreme Court clarified that Bits of Gold operated transparently and did not violate any statutory provision. In other words, the Supreme Court determined that currently there is no direct legal prohibition on cryptocurrency trading in Israel. It remains to be seen how regulators in Israel will respond to this landmark decision.”Regardless of how regulators will respond, it’s already clear that progress on Israeli blockchain innovations hasn’t slowed.“As with any new and promising technology, jurisdictions that instate well-balanced policies to promote innovation and adoption, will find themselves attracting talent and business to their ecosystems on grand scales. The best frameworks will be the ones that take a learning approach, allowing entrepreneurs and institutions to deeply understand how these technologies affect all stakeholders and develop the policies which are beneficial to most while educating the public on tradeoffs and accountability. Israel has always seen the advancement of technology as a strength and opportunity, and is well positioned to lead in Blockchain development and applications,” said Galia Benartzi, Co-founder of Bancor.Itay Nagler, Israeli citizen and CEO of blockchain-driven travel startup Cool Cousin, says that Israelis, as a default, undercut the perception that things can't or shouldn't change.“We are almost raised to believe that there is always a better, more efficient way to do things. That is one of the main reasons such a small country is home to many great innovative companies and individuals. This is also an explanation to why Israelis were among the firsts to adopt blockchain technology and crypto. A lot of us see it as a wonderful solution to many problems and our mentality of ""no fear"" to change, and relatively easy access to quality human resources and funding allows us to act on it. This, I believe, helped us during the past decades to position ourselves as pioneers and experts in many industries.""Even though there were no concrete regulations of the industry before, it didn’t stop entrepreneurs from launching blockchain projects of their own. Bancor was one of the first major ICOs, raising over $150 million in mere minutes, and has its origins in Israel. IOTA, an IoT-focused Blockchain solution, recently opened an office in Tel Aviv, noting that the city is “a well-established tech hub, always ranking in the top 10 of start-up reports.”  These positive changes, however, go contrary to the recent decision by the Israeli regulators of not including companies involved in the crypto industry in the TASE, Tel Aviv Stock Exchange indices, due to its ‘trading volatility.’Israel appears to be setting itself in the Blockchain ecosystem, along with the rest of the world, but tries first guarantee that the market’s grey areas be limited while its most useful attributes allowed to flourish.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Adoption    #Cryptocurrencies    #Israel    #IOTA  
French Financial Regulator To Introduce Framework Legitimizing ICOs In Policy U-Turn,Helen Partz,3/17/2018 22:21,35867,481,"French financial markets regulator AMF (l'Autorité des marchés financiers) is reportedly preparing to introduce legislation on Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) to encourage the development of the new type of fundraising in the country, reports local news outlet Les Echos March 15.The French Ministry for the Economy and Finance confirmed that the regulatory framework proposed by the AMF would recognize ICOs as a legitimate means of investment. The Ministry noted that preliminary consultations with stakeholders and associations are necessary.“Our goal is to provide legal certainty for those who seek it, without hindering those who want to follow their own path. We have a rather liberal approach. We work for a flexible, non-dissuasive framework. At the same time, we are not naive either, we know that these products can be risky,” say sources from the Ministry of Finance told Les Echos.The 180 degree shift in policy follows a recent ban of 15 cryptocurrency and crypto-asset investment websites announced by AMF on March 15. The websites in question were found to be unlawfully marketing cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets as investments in France.The new regulatory framework for ICOs would establish an authorization system for issuers to receive a license from the AMF. According to the AMF, ICOs which operate without a license would not be banned. Instead, a licensed ICO means that the token issuer must provide a certain set of guarantees to investors regarding the usage of raised funds.The French government’s abrupt move towards legal support of ICOs is a drastic departure from the sceptical stance of the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) that heavily regulates ICOs, and considers many of them to be “violating existing laws.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Government    #France    #Investments  
Luxembourg’s Financial Regulator Issues Warning Against Cryptocurrencies and ICOs,Veronika Rinecker,3/17/2018 18:54,31912,286,"The Luxembourg Financial Regulator CSSF issued a warning against investments in cryptocurrencies and ICOs (Initial Coin Offering), Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reported today, March 17.  In the official warning the authority notes that cryptocurrencies are not backed by any central bank, and warns against the volatility of virtual currencies, stressing that deals are often not entirely transparent and business models are incomprehensible. It warned of the absence of consumer protection and the risk of theft, since cryptocurrency exchanges may be vulnerable to hackers. Furthermore, according to the regulator, information about cryptocurrencies is “often incomplete, difficult to understand or does not reflect the risks of cryptocurrencies”.The CSSF specifically hones in on their perceived risks of investing in ICOs. According to the authority, the ICO model is unproven and lacks verifiable information about the tokens and the money collected.The Luxembourg regulator also made a point of saying that it was not concerned about Blockchain technology in use cases apart from cryptocurrencies, noting that Blockchain “could bring certain advantages in their use in the financial sector and in different innovative projects.”In addition to the CSSF, other European government regulators have also expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies and ICOs recently. In Fall 2017, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) indicated that the purchase of coins or tokens sold in ICOs entails significant risks for investors and described ICOs as ""highly speculative investments"". In November 2017, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) also warned investors about the high risks of the ICOs.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Luxembourg    #Finance    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies  
US Congress Includes Crypto In Its Joint Economic Report For The First Time,Ana Alexandre,3/17/2018 1:27,35605,667,"For the first time the US Congress has dedicated an entire section to cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology in its annual Joint Economic Report, published March 13.The 2018 Joint Economic Report contains analysis and recommendations for the coming year and dedicates an entire chapter to providing insight into the impact of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain on the US economy today.The report calls 2017 “the year of cryptocurrencies”, pointing out that widespread concern over Bitcoin drove it to second place as a global news topic in Google’s Year in Search 2017.The price of a number of cryptocurrency and Blockchain assets showed a dramatic surge, leaving behind some key economic indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.“...If digital currencies become less volatile in the future, valuing items in those denominations could become easier and individuals might begin using them more frequently as a medium of exchange,” the report says.Cryptocurrency market capitalization was positively influenced by skyrocketing prices. At the beginning of 2017, the aggregate value of all Bitcoin in circulation totalled almost $15.5 bln, but by the end of the year it increased nearly 14-fold to over $216 bln. Such digital currencies as Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin experienced similar gains.However, according to the report, many leading economists, including former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, still don’t believe cryptocurrencies fit the standard definition of money and call Bitcoin a “highly speculative asset”.The recommendations contained in the document represent a particular interest, as the authors advise government agencies at all levels to consider and examine new uses for the technology. Namely, they recognize Blockchain’s potential to boost agency efficiency and ensure security against cyber attacks.“Policymakers, regulators, and entrepreneurs should continue to work together to ensure developers can deploy these new Blockchain technologies quickly and in a manner that protects Americans from fraud, theft, and abuse, while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations,” the report adds.The survey also underlined that Blockchain has “proved largely resistant to hacking” and “has many more potential applications.”Though digital currencies and Blockchain still stir up dispute, the analysis presented in the report demonstrates that governmental bodies can’t ignore the revolutionary technology of Blockchain. As the report noted, the technology can be utilized in vital fields such as healthcare and securing critical financial and energy infrastructure.Earlier this week the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment convened for a hearing devoted to cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), and Blockchain development in the US, making it plain that further regulatory clarification from the US government is necessary.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #USA    #Congress  
US: SEC Official Confirms “Dozens” of Cryptocurrency Probes,Aaron Wood,3/17/2018 0:51,31576,256,"The US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) Enforcement Division Co-Director Stephanie Avakian confirmed that the agency is conducting “dozens” of investigations in the cryptocurrency space, Bloomberg BNA reports March 15.Avakain’s comments follow press reports in late February that the SEC has sent subpoenas to companies suspected of running afoul of securities laws via their involvement in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Avakian said, “We are very active, and I would just expect to see more and more.”Over the course of the past year, the SEC has ramped up its actions against crypto-related companies it sees as flaunting securities laws. The commission has brought more than half a dozen actions against companies since September 2017, according Bloomberg.On March 7th the SEC released a statement reminding cryptocurrency trading platforms that they fall under the jurisdiction and regulatory purview of the SEC, and as a result, must register as exchanges. In February 2018, SEC oversight resulted in the trading of three different companies being suspended due to “questions” regarding ties to cryptocurrency.The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US remains unclear. As Chief Legal and Risk Officer at Coinbase Mike Lempres pointed out in a testimony before Congress on March 14, the major financial regulatory bodies cannot agree on the nature of cryptocurrency. The SEC considers it a security, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), considers tokens a commodity, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers tokens to be property, while the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) consider tokens currency.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #SEC    #Government  
US: Plattsburgh NY Introduces Temporary Ban On New Crypto Mining Operations,Aaron Wood,3/16/2018 18:53,21094,262,"The small US city of Plattsburgh NY has unanimously passed a measure to ban crypto mining in the town, Vice reported March 15.The city council unanimously approved an 18 month moratorium on crypto mining activities in Plattsburgh. The moratorium only affects new Bitcoin mining operations and does not affect ones already existing in the city.The idea of a moratorium was first introduced by mayor Colin Read in January after residents reported inflated electricity bills:“I’ve been hearing a lot of complaints that electric bills have gone up by $100 or $200. You can understand why people are upset.”Plattsburgh benefits cheap electricity provided by a hydroelectric dam located on the Saint Lawrence River. While residents usually pay $0.045 per kilowatt hour (kWh), industries including  Bitcoin mining operations only have to pay $0.02 cents/kWh.The biggest Bitcoin mining operation in the city used 10 percent of Plattsburgh’s 104 megawatt hour (Mwh) electricity allotment in January and February. Speaking to Vice, Read said that he'd seen proposals that suggested using 20 to 30 Mwh of electricity for Bitcoin mining operations. “We don't have that,” said Read.Over the course of the next 18 months, city officials will be working with residents and local mining operations to find a solution to the energy problem that will keep residents’ energy bills low, while allowing businesses to come to the town.One proposed solution is to make miners pay for overages of the city’s power budget or increase the rates per kWh for miners.Tom Pillsworth, a local resident and partner in a Bitcoin mining enterprise in the city, said that, “It would never cost the Plattsburgh citizens any more money to let more miners come in here because the miners are willing to pay for those overages… The miners are more than willing to pay.”Small towns with low energy costs have become a destination for mining companies who flock to rural areas in which low costs per kWh make it easier for them to turn a profit.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Mining    #Government    #Energy  
US Congress Divided On Crypto: From ‘Regulation Is A Wet Blanket’ To ‘Crypto Is A Crock’,Aaron Wood,3/16/2018 15:34,25715,302,"The Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment convened Wednesday, March 14, to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies, digital currencies, ICOs, and Blockchain development in the US.Throughout the course of the proceedings, it became clear that the panel of four crypto and Blockchain industry experts was more or less in agreement that further regulatory clarification from the US government is necessary. However, the committee members, representing different parties and a wide range of ideologies, displayed a range of positions, from condemnation, to hands-off encouragement.Following opening remarks, representatives on the committee interviewed the panel of experts on topics ranging from the efficacy of current regulations and regulatory bodies, like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to cybersecurity and the nature of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Representatives who were unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and Blockchain took the opportunity chance to clarify these terms with top experts.The industry expert panel that appeared before the subcommittee as witnesses consisted of legal professionals from various spheres: Mike Lempres, Chief Legal and Risk Officer at Coinbase, Dr. Chris Brummer, Professor of Law at Georgetown University, and Robert Rosenblum, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati specializing in cryptocurrency and Blockchain companies, and Peter Van Valkenburgh, a self-proclaimed “cryptolawyer” and the Director of Research at CoinCenter.Per the format of House Committee hearings, each witness was allowed a five minute statement, and then Representatives then proceeded with their own question sessions of five minutes each.While the panel of experts participate differently within the crypto space, they were largely in agreement before the subcommittee that the current state of regulations in the US is insufficient to ensure the success of the industry, that many are willing to comply, but  ""just need clarity"".Lempres was the first to give his remarks, stating that, “There is no need for Congress to create a new regulator or regulatory scheme, because federal regulators already have sufficient authority to oversee this space effectively.” Lempres added however, that regulatory agencies need to be able to distinguish between different tokens to enable innovation, saying, “this requires regulators to coordinate and provide clear guidance to market participants.”While Lempres noted the efforts Coinbase has taken to ensure compliance at all levels, including Coinbase’s BitLicense with the state of New York, he added that the unorganized nature of the regulatory structure would ultimately lead to redundancies between state and federal policy.The panel largely agreed that ICOs were especially in need of regulatory oversight. Dr. Brummer pointed out the lack of standardized disclosure for those running ICOs, noting that whitepapers are entirely unregulated, in the sense that they are neither held up to any standards, nor are they required to provide potential investors with any particular information.Rosenblum later stated that he has seen people in ICO markets raising money in ways that “any securities lawyer would have told you and truthfully did tell you, you shouldn’t do… No rational securities lawyer would every sell, or advise their client to sell off a whitepaper. We always sell off a private placement memo or disclosure document.”On the other hand, Lempres noted the potential and inevitability of ICOs to enable entrepreneurs to raise money outside of the traditional VC system, “on a level playing field”:“Entrepreneurs won’t need to know funders in Silicon Valley or New York to access vibrant sources of capital. At the same time there is a need for responsible regulation to ensure investor protection. We welcome that regulation.”The attitudes of the Representatives ranged from cautiously optimistic about new technologies, to outwardly hostile toward the industry as a whole. Representative David Scott of Georgia, also the co-chairman of the Fintech Caucus, asked questions pertaining to the safety of crypto investors, questioning the panel earnestly on how they could create a more streamlined regulatory structure: “[The SEC and CFTC] have not proposed rules regarding the regulations of cryptocurrency and other digital assets and instead have relied on informal rulemaking or enforcement actions, so I want to ask you in particular Mr. Rosenblum, what in your minds could federal regulators be doing better?[...] to regulate this [sic] emerging and exciting digital assets.”Rosenblum answered Rep. Scott’s question by first agreeing that regulation by enforcement was not the best path to take, saying:“I agree with the point that you’re moving towards… regulation by enforcement in an area that is as dynamic as this is not the appropriate way to regulate... I do agree with you entirely, we need clear guidelines, clearer understanding of how the SEC’s registration rules… should apply and do apply, and that not something that you can through regulation by enforcement.”Representative Sherman of California was far less conciliatory towards the industry as a whole, and condemned the very idea of cryptocurrencies. In his opening remarks he said:“Cryptocurrencies are a crock…They help terrorists and criminals move money around the world... They help start-up companies commit fraud, take the money, and one percent of the time they actually create a useful business, but then again I daresay that some tiny percent of all larceny and crime helps finance something that turns out to be useful.”During Rep. Sherman’s question session to the panel, Van Valkenburgh attempted to explain how cryptocurrencies are useful to “underbanked” or “unbanked” individuals.“Cryptocurrencies are accessible, they’re accessible financial tools only on the basic precondition that someone has a smartphone and an internet connection and I think there are regions of the world where people will sooner have smartphones and internet connections than access to valuable and secure financial services from companies,” said Van Valkenburgh.Sherman ended his session still convinced of cryptocurrency’s inherent nefariousness, saying “perhaps we’ll have another hearing after some major terrorist event financed by cryptocurrencies.”Rep. Emmer from Minnesota, who is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, took a different approach entirely from his colleagues, calling for minimal regulation in the industry. Rep. Emmer insisted that he feared regulation would only stifle innovation in the Blockchain space and give more power to the government, saying almost any regulation would be a “wet blanket” on the industry’s development. Emmer urged those present not to, ""take the policemen we already have and give them more powers to start to invade this space and perhaps frustrate the development.""The lack of defined regulatory guidelines for the crypto space not only creates an environment in which legitimate companies must walk on eggshells for fear of running afoul of regulations. Part of the problems is that, as Lempres pointed out, there’s no unity among US regulators as to what a cryptocurrency actually is. For a given cryptocurrency, the SEC may consider it a security, while the CFTC considers it a commodity, the IRS considers it property, and the FinCEN thinks it’s money.According to Mr. Lempres, ideally “the SEC and CFTC should be able to draw a line to determine whether a token should be treated as a commodity or as a security.”Even among the panel of experts, there was some disagreement as to when a cryptocurrency changes from a security into a commodity. Van Valkenburgh, Rosenblum, and Brummer all agree that the Howey Test, a test created by the Supreme Court to determine if an asset is a security, is an appropriate way to evaluate a crypto token, such as those sold during ICOs. However, Rosenblum argued that after a token has been sold during an ICO and is, it was often unclear how the status of the token – often used as a native currency on a given platform while also be traded on exchanges – should be determined.What everyone agrees on, however, is that the US government’s current inability to provide a regulatory clarity risks losing opportunities to other countries. To this point, Van Valkenburgh stated:“If policy makers get the line between commodity tokens and securities offerings wrong, and if it isn’t made clear by regulators, it will destroy the viability of these innovations and cede leadership of this technology to the rest of the world.”Reflecting on the effectiveness of the hearing overall, Dr. Brummer told Cointelegraph that “there was certainly a sense that everyone was engaged and trying to think through some complex issues in serious way.  Which is an important prerequisite to sound policymaking.""At press time Mr. Rosenblum as well as representative Ellison had not responded to Cointelegraph’s requests for comments.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #SEC    #Government    #CFTC    #Congress  
French Regulatory Agency Blacklists 15 Cryptocurrency And Crypto-Asset Websites,Aaron Wood,3/16/2018 1:27,53957,378,"The French stock market regulator, The Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), announced in a press release that they have added 15 cryptocurrency and crypto-asset investment websites to a blacklist on March 15.According to the press release, the companies listed ran afoul of the “Sapin II Law”, stating that:“The investment proposals highlighting the possibility of financial returns or similar economic effects involve intermediation in miscellaneous assets and are now subject to ex ante control by the AMF. Consequently, no offer can be directly marketed in France without prior allocation by the AMF of a registration number.”The press release then lists 15 offending companies, who continued to advertise and market their services as investment opportunities to the French public, despite new regulations. The blacklist also contains businesses that unlawfully offered investments in commodities like rare earth metals, wine, and diamonds.The statement reminds consumers that “no advertising materials should make you overlook the fact that high returns always involve high risk.” It further advises consumers to by duly diligent before making an investment, to learn as much as one can about the company or intermediary, and to only invest in a product one understands.This move by French regulators follows a pattern of suspicious attitudes toward cryptocurrencies from the French government. In December of last year, the Governor of the Bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, issued a warning on the high risks of investing in Bitcoin, claiming it is a speculative asset, and neither a currency or a digital currency.In January, France’s Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire appointed Jean-Pierre Landau, an open Bitcoin critic, to head a task force to examine cryptocurrency regulation. Landau has called Bitcoin the “tulips of modern times” in reference to Tulip Mania, which swept Europe in the early 17th century.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #France  
Thailand Delivers First Draft Of ‘Digital Asset’ Regulations,William Suberg,3/16/2018 0:20,27831,282,"Thailand’s government issued drafts of cryptocurrency and ICO legislation as lawmakers reiterated they had no intention of banning the technology, Bangkok Post reported March 14.As Bangkok Post and others report, Nathporn Chatusripitak, a spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, announced the two pending royal decrees, which will now go forward to approval from the Council of State as well as a cabinet vote.The drafts themselves highlight plans to collect a capital gains tax of up to 15 percent on “digital asset” profits – defined as “cryptocurrencies, digital tokens and other assets in the form of electronic data”, according to Thailand’s Finance Ministry.In addition, the government will require all actors involved in conducting digital asset business to be “registered with relevant authorities,” as per Bangkok Post.The exact tax levy is yet to be decided, the publication adds, with further specific details to follow later this month.Thailand has adopted a highly prudent approach to cryptocurrency and ICO investment in recent months.As Cointelegraph previously reported, in February 2018, the Central Bank of Thailand ordered financial institutions not to interact with cryptocurrencies or ICOs before the new regulations had come into effect.Two weeks later, the Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX) cited the same reason as being behind its decision to temporarily pause ICO registrations.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Thailand    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government

The letter allegedly states:""To ensure our customer’s security, we have decided to not permit usage of HDFC Bank credit, debit and prepaid cards towards purchase or trading of such bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies on merchants suspected to be dealing in cryptocurrency or online foreign exchange trading or both.""The letter also mentioned that the Reserve Bank of India had repeated warnings to citizens “regarding the potential economic, operational, legal and security related risks associated in dealing with such currencies.""The move follows last month’s Citibank India decision to ban both credit and debit cards for crypto purchases due to “security-related risks associated in dealing with bitcoins.”The ban specifically of credit cards for crypto purchases was initiated by US giants J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup on Feb. 3, 2018. The move was followed by the largest bank in the UK, Lloyds Banking Group, Feb. 5, and Virgin Money in Australia, South Africa, and the UK on Feb. 6.

"Google AdWords: ‘Ecosystem That Works For Everyone’, Except For A Lot Of Good People",Andrew Marshall,3/15/2018 19:42,24031,580,"Google announced Wednesday, March 14 that it will be forbidding advertisers from serving cryptocurrency-related ads via its ad network AdWords starting from June 2018, following a similar move made by Facebook back in January 2018.The goal behind the ban, according to Google’s director of sustainable ads Scott Spencer, is to protect the search giant’s audience from “deceptive content” served by unscrupulous actors that use cryptocurrency, as well as other types of offers to scam people online. Spencer writes:“As consumer trends evolve, as our methods to protect the open web get better, so do online scams. Improving the ads experience across the web, whether that's removing harmful ads or intrusive ads, will continue to be a top priority for us.”Positive turns of phrase in Spencer’s text, such as “protect the open web” and “improving the ads experience”, may sound promising on the surface. But just a slightly closer look at Google’s new ad policy exposes what appears to be a contradiction of everything that the company stands – or at least once stood – for.In what can only be described as a surprising lack of regard for nuance, Google listed “initial coin offerings” and “cryptocurrency trading advice” in the same breath as “binary options” and “synonymous products”, as it described the types of content that will no longer be allowed to be advertised via AdWords from June onwards.Some may argue that banning ICO ads is justified – after all, since the explosion of popularity of this cryptocurrency-based fundraising model in 2017, it had become an easy and fairly popular tool for scammers to extract money from unsuspecting investors.However, Google also plans to ban “cryptocurrency exchanges” and “cryptocurrency wallets,” the two types of businesses that have existed almost since the very inception of Bitcoin back in 2009, and the vast majority of which are providing real value to their customers and driving forward the growth of cryptocurrency as an industry.Without explicitly stating it, the newly introduced ad policy additionally implies banning so-called Blockchain platforms, or companies that in some way integrate Blockchain technology — cryptocurrencies are almost always an integral part of Blockchain platforms’ ecosystems, contrary to what some mainstream opinion leaders would have you believe.These would, for example, include Microsoft’s Ethereum Blockchain as a Service that it offers on its Azure platform, or IBM’s Hyperledger Fabric which, among other things, allows users to transact digital assets, a.k.a. cryptocurrencies.Ironically, several companies that Google itself has invested in would have trouble advertising under the new policies as well, such as Storj, made possible by the company’s native SJCX cryptocurrency, or Veem, which uses none other than Bitcoin as a vehicle for its remittances.Blockchain.info, one of the top Bitcoin wallets, which Alphabet Inc. invested in via its GV (formerly Google Ventures) arm, is now guaranteed to be restricted from AdWords due to the ban on ads of “cryptocurrency wallets” – that is, assuming Google is not going to violate its own policy.And perhaps violate it will. What’s stopping a company that uses nigh-Orwellian doublespeak to describe AdWords as “an advertising ecosystem that works for everyone” just as it bans legitimate businesses from using it, and claims that it protects “the open web” by instituting what can easily be argued is targeted censorship?With such a wide range of potentially affected businesses, this blanket ban on “all things crypto” is more reminiscent of an authoritarian, luddite government choosing to outlaw a technology that it does not understand, nor care to figure out, rather than of a company that has allowed innovative thinking turn it from a garage startup into a tech giant running the most popular search engine on the planet in well under 10 years.One of Google’s most famous management practices is its “20 percent rule”: at least in the past, the company allowed its employees to spend 20 percent of their actual work time on side projects without supervision or strict guidelines. This license to create with no censorship in the form of corporate oversight has reportedly resulted in a lot of innovations for Google News, Gmail and AdSense, some of the principal services of Google.Just a week ago, however, the company was busy denying their – in hindsight obvious – now public ad policy change in regards to cryptocurrency businesses and even pointing fingers at Facebook for doing the same, according to an email Finance Magnates received from Google. And this isn’t even the most absurd case of Google’s censorship attempts, as earlier in February it banned water guns and Burgundy wine from its shopping platform while trying to prevent illegal firearm sales.What has happened is anyone’s guess. Perhaps, Google has grown complacent after positioning itself at the top of the food chain and decided that it doesn’t need to uphold its own ideals anymore. Or maybe they just don’t think the crypto and Blockchain industry is important enough to spend time separating the wheat from the chaff.What’s more important to the people who understand that not everything with the word “cryptocurrency” in it is a scam is the realization that censorship resulting from unrestricted authority is exactly what Blockchain has been designed to disrupt. And it is not unlikely that Google itself will too realize this dark irony someday.At press time, Cointelegraph is waiting for commentary from cryptocurrency industry experts who are likely to be affected by Google’s new policies. This article will be updated as soon as we receive their statements.",17,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Google    #Cryptocurrencies    #Facebook

UK Financial Authority Warns Investors Against Cryptocurrency Derivatives,Joshua Althauser,11/15/2017 11:54,4695,215,"British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has issued a warning to investors against venturing into cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs). The agency claimed that digital currency-based CFDs are considered to be high-risk investments.In a statement posted on its website in mid-November 2017, the FCA issued its warning to investors against investing in crypto-based CFDs due to several risks that they could face. Among the risks are price volatility, leverage, charges and funding costs and price transparency.The agency further added that investors should carefully examine whether venturing into virtual currency CFDs is right for them. It claimed that the legal safeguards currently in place cannot protect them and will not compensate them for any losses that they could incur from trading.""Cryptocurrency CFDs are an extremely high-risk, speculative investment. You should be aware of the risks involved and fully consider whether investing in cryptocurrency CFDs is appropriate for you.""In a CFD deal, the transacting parties agree to pay either side when the underlying value of an asset changes over time. The CFD products enable users to speculate on the prices of various assets. While digital currencies can be considered as CFD products, the agency warned that investing in them is very risky.The FCA has already issued several investor warnings against investments related to digital currencies in the past.In June 2017, FCA Director of Strategy and Competition, Chris Woolard, warned that investors should exercise a degree of caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies.In September, the regulator has also cautioned that initial coin offerings (ICO) are “very risky” investments and asked would-be participants to inform or report to the agency any possible fraud that they may encounter in the cryptocurrency-based funding model.Other countries such as Germany, United States and the Netherlands have also released their warnings about investing in ICOs earlier this month.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #United Kingdom    #Investments    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tradings

The move was made after the government-owned central bank has announced that it is softening its stance on the virtual currencies.In a press conference in mid-November 2017, Central Bank of Iran Deputy Director of New Technologies, Naser Hakimi, announced that the central bank is studying Bitcoin and planning to examine its policies about digital currencies. He, however, issued a warning to investors about the “uncertainty” and “risk” that they could face in the cryptocurrency market.""Given that Bitcoin and other currencies have not been introduced by the central bank as the official currency, as well as the risk of buying it and the activity of traders in this field, more precautions are coming into the market because of the possibility of malice.""In early 2017, Financial Tribune reported that Hakimi has referred to Bitcoin as an “opportunity” that should be exploited by the Iranian government. He claimed then that Bitcoin and other digital currencies can be used by traders who failed to open lines of credit due to banking issues.Aside from Iran, other countries in the Middle East region are tackling virtual currencies. In October, the Lebanese Central Bank governor claimed that the Lebanese government is planning to introduce its own digital currency. It is not clear, however, if the cryptocurrency will be based on Blockchain technology.Meanwhile, the Head of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Central Bank, Mubarak Rashed Al Mansouri, has criticized Bitcoin’s lack of supervision and regulation.

Ukrainian Top Lawmaker Wants to Exempt Crypto Income and Profits from Taxation,Lisa Froelings,11/15/2017 9:25,5104,284,"Ukraine has been consistently moving towards legalizing Bitcoin in the country. The country has also endeavored to establish itself as a transparent nation by auctioning seized items through Blockchain by allowing digitized ledger of transactions for those who interested to see.On Oct. 30, Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on Tax and Customs Policy Chairperson Nina Yuzhanina has submitted a bill amending Ukraine’s tax codes covering the cryptocurrencies and their derivatives.Under the bill, all digital currency income and profits will be exempted from taxation, including those from buying, selling, transacting and mining operations.Based on the note attached to the bill, the tax exemption on virtual currencies is aimed at creating an effective mechanism to stimulate the market of digital currencies in the country.“In order to create an effective mechanism for stimulating the market of cryptocurrency in Ukraine, the logical step is the exemption from taxation of profits of enterprises…Income from cryptocurrency operations should not be included in the calculation of the total monthly (annually) taxable income, and transactions with cryptocurrency and mining crypto goods are classified as transactions that are not subject to taxation.”The tax exemption bill referred to as Bill No. 7246 is the third proposed legislation filed in the Ukrainian parliament aimed at regulating the use of digital currencies in the country.The first bill aimed at establishing virtual currencies like Bitcoin as legal properties that can be exchanged for goods and services was filed in early October. In mid-October, the second bill titled “On the stimulation of the market of cryptocurrencies and their derivatives in Ukraine” was filed.The bill is intended to consider legalizing digital currencies as financial assets.Meanwhile, the government of Ukraine has taken steps to regulate the use of virtual currencies in the country. On Oct. 26, the High Council of Experts of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) conducted a meeting to tackle digital currency regulations.In its press release after the meeting, the NBU said that the council has approved the proposals to determine the legal status of cryptocurrencies.“During the event, the recommendations of the High Council of Experts on the urgent need for determining the legal status of cryptocurrency in Ukraine were approved.”Such interest in exempting cryptocurrency transactions from income taxes does not come off as a surprise considering the fact that some Ukrainian legislators have in fact admitted to being major Bitcoin holders.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ukraine    #Cryptocurrencies    #Taxes    #Investments  
Adam Back: Bitcoin Block Size Increase in Mid-Term is Possible,Joseph Young,11/14/2017 19:05,19540,363,"On Nov. 13 Blockstream CEO and HashCash inventor Adam Back, who remains as one of the few individuals cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper released by Satoshi Nakamoto, explained Bitcoin block size increase in the mid-term is a possibility that has not been ruled out.In response to a statement provided by Jihan Wu, the co-founder of Bitmain, the $3 bln Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturing company, regarding the necessity of a block size increase to reduce Bitcoin Blockchain congestion, Back stated:“Probably mid-term with enough testing yes. But in the meantime it would be nice if people would stop spamming. Thanks.”Bitcoin Core is not fundamentally opposed to on-chain scalingAs explained by Back, the Bitcoin Core development team has not been fundamentally opposed to on-chain Bitcoin scaling. In 2014 Back noted that a gradual block increase to 2MB, 4MB, and 8MB is a viable option in the mid-term, until second-layer payment channels are fully adopted by the industry, wallet platforms, and exchanges.But, Bitcoin Core and the majority of the Bitcoin community remain certain that block size increase is not a long-term scaling solution, in contrast to public viewpoints, because there is a limit to which the block size of any Blockchain network including Bitcoin can be increased to.One major reason Bitcoin block size increase is not a long-term scaling solution is because if the block size increases in proportion to the growth of the Blockchain network’s user base, inevitably the block size will achieve a point wherein individual node operators are left out and transactions are verified by a centralized group of nodes. Such is the level of centralization imposes danger to any Blockchain network apart from Bitcoin.For instance, if the block size of a Blockchain network is increased to 10MB, to 50MB, and eventually to 100MB, it will create an ecosystem wherein individual node operators are essentially non-existent.“If my block takes 11 minutes to validate, then I’m off the Blockchain, which means fewer people can validate independently, which means the system becomes centralized. With one of these increases, fewer people can participate in the validation process, fewer people can participate in storing the data, and fewer people can participate in being independent actors. We go from a system that is decentralized to a system that gradually gets more and more centralized,” explained Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos.Hence, Bitcoin block size should be planned ahead, undergo rigorous testing, be carefully thought out, and conducted only when absolutely necessary, during a period in which the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network become too high for the vast majority to settle a payment.Recently the transaction fees have been substantially high, most of them being above $1 to $2, but the increase in the size of the Bitcoin mempool was triggered by the migration of Bitcoin miners to the Bitcoin Cash network. The instability in hashing power led hundreds of thousands of transactions left unconfirmed, eventually increasing the size of the Bitcoin mempool to over 100 million bytes.As miners return to the Bitcoin network after the next difficult adjustment and more businesses adopt SegWit for around 35 percent reduction in fee,s according to Bitcoin hardware wallet development firm Ledger fees should be manageable in the short-term.In the mid-term, if transaction fees become too high, as Back stated, block size increase is certainly a possibility with rigorous and thorough testing.",38,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Adam Back    #Fees    #BlockStream    #Jihan Wu    #Bitmain

BREAKING: China May Cut Off Cheap Power To Bitcoin Miners?,Jon Buck,11/14/2017 13:10,41343,1263,"Apparently, the general anti-Bitcoin stance of the Chinese government continues, with reports that the cheap hydroelectric power being used by the largest Chinese Bitcoin mining facilities may soon be a thing of the past, according to local media.The statement regarding the cessation of cheap mining electricity indicates that the Sichuan Electric Power Company has issued a circular indicating that it will no longer provide the necessary power from its grid-connected hydropower stations. The circular suggests that Bitcoin mining is ‘illegal operation.’ The circular has yet to be confirmed.The statement from the power companies does not reflect the general feeling of miners, according to the article. Miners feel that the Bitcoin operations are using ‘discarded water’ - water that is let go without producing electricity, which is why the price has been remarkably low.Nevertheless, the supply cut off is coming from both sides, as the province has declared both a ‘no new power plants’ policy, as well as acquiring all existing power plants. Per the article:“Sichuan, on the one hand, issued a circular at the policy level, requiring no new small hydropower stations; [at the same time] the power company is stepping up its acquisition of small hydropower stations to promote the latter's power grid, [leaving] Bitcoin low-cost electrical space increasingly cramped.”Such a change would reflect the pervasive feeling from the government of China, as cryptocurrencies have increasingly met with increasingly constricting regulation.While the story is not yet confirmed, interested readers should stay tuned to Cointelegraph for continuing updates.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Mining    #Electricity    #Cointelegraph  
More ICO Warnings As EU Issues Two Regulatory Statements,William Suberg,11/14/2017 12:55,9707,250,"European Union regulators have issued two further warnings on ICOs, directed at both investors and participating businesses.Released Monday, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) followed multiple jurisdictions in raising concerns that ICOs may not conform to regulatory norms.“ESMA has observed a rapid growth in ICOs globally and in Europe and is concerned that investors may be unaware of the high risks that they are taking when investing in ICOs,” a summary of the reports states.“Additionally, ESMA is concerned that firms involved in ICOs may conduct their activities without complying with relevant applicable EU legislation.”The “concerns” come as the ICO industry undergoes major changes. A far cry from the explosive growth seen just months previously, pressure from lawmakers has appeared to engender a slowdown in the number of token sales and amounts raised.A shift to providing legislation-compliant exposure to cryptocurrency meanwhile is coming to the fore, with global FX market CME Group announcing its Bitcoin futures trading would likely go live by the middle of next month.Correspondingly, ESMA takes the opportunity to “remind” firms involved in ICOs of their required adherence two four specific EU directives on anti-money laundering (AML).“It is the duty of the firms themselves to consider the regulatory framework, seeking the necessary permissions and meeting the applicable requirements,” it added.Regulators in countries including Canada and the UK have voiced similar worries about the need for securities compliance in recent months, while Chinese exchange BTCC’s CEO Bobby Lee has said he considers it unlikely China would reverse its ban on the practice in the near future.",3,  #Altcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #EU    #ESMA    #Government

Trading of tokens on these platforms is susceptible to price manipulation and other fraudulent trading practices.""In his speech, Clayton also detailed the SEC’s findings from its investigation of the collapse of the Ethereum-based funding platform DAO to the seminar attendees.

He claims that the virtual currencies are unlikely to survive in the long term as governments around the world introduce steps to regulate them.In a CNBC interview on the sidelines of the Web Summit conference held in Lisbon, Portugal in early November 2017, Oudea said that the main benefit of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies is its ability to provide anonymity to the individuals who are conducting the deals.""The benefit so far is it provides anonymity to the people who are making the transactions. I can't see a future of this when I see the attention played by all governments and regulators on anti-money laundering, on anti-tax evasion, on anti-terrorism financing. The anonymity of the transaction is a problem I think which would put pressure on Bitcoin.""Despite his negative view on the virtual currencies, Oudea showed support to the technology behind them, the Blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). Blockchain or DLT enables data to be stored in huge volumes across a secure network of computers.""I'm more a believer of a distributed ledger technology where you have a defined set of players (that are) well-identified. We choose this mix of crypto technology to secure transactions.""Oudea has shown support to the proposal that the cryptocurrencies can be supported by fiat currencies. He, however, voiced out his concern that the virtual currencies are too risky for mainstream use.""I think we need to be a bit more precise on what we call virtual currency at the end of the day. If it's just a way in a transaction, at some point to add something which virtually can translate on both sides into real currencies, maybe it can be used as a system.

"China Struggles to Lay Killing Blow to Bitcoin, Currency Thrives",Darryn Pollock,11/9/2017 5:45,29169,549,"China became the first country to take a hardline approach to ICOs, then moved on to Bitcoin and the exchanges that trade the digital currency. Despite these bold and brazen efforts, Bitcoin’s price is higher than ever, and the currency continues to be a factor in China. Where there’s a will there’s a way, and Chinese investors are still managing to trade Bitcoin and buy into controversial ICOs.The initial news of China’s take down of Bitcoin, which was timed with Jamie Dimon’s slur on Bitcoin, caused the price to take a dive. As the price dropped from $5,000 to $3,000 on the news, the fear was that further exclusion of a major Bitcoin player, like China, would erase Bitcoin’s price gains this year. However, this has not been the case at all.Instead of a total shutdown, what has happened is that resourceful Chinese traders have adjusted their methods, switching to a private over-the-counter market.Over the counter Bitcoin trading has risen from about 5% at the beginning of September, before exchanges were shuttered, to about 20% a month later. This is according to data cited in a report by the National Committee of Experts on Internet Financial Security, a government-backed research group.Traders have had to move with the times to stay relevant in the Bitcoin market, which has also seen a change in messaging app to effect these peer-to-peer trades.State controlled messaging app WeChat has seen an exodus of Bitcoin related chat as the more neutral Telegram has picked up the slack. This is where the Chinese population has found aid in making over the counter trades.There are still plenty of issues for miners to overcome in China due to new regulations. Many have fled to China’s hinterland in Gansu and Inner Mongolia, where cheap electricity can power massive rigs.This new peer-to-peer market, however, is still young, and not liquid enough to allow these miners to set up the sale of their newly minted coins. According to Thomas Glucksman, head of marketing for Gatecoin:“There are a lot of questions about the future of the Chinese miners, given that they still need to pay for staff and operations in renminbi. It’s either a case of migrating their operations or facilitating renminbi cash-out through the over the counter market.”",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Jamie Dimon    #Mining

If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.No one wants to think about tax bills from the IRS, much less interest and penalties. But if you are one of the legions of people capitalizing on the wild west of cryptocurrency, you might need to. At the very least, you should occasionally stop to think about the IRS and taxes. Here are 10 tips:You might not agree with the IRS, but the tax man says cryptocurrency is property. The IRS made this clear in Notice 2014-21. Cryptocurrency isn’t foreign currency, and it isn’t domestic currency, regardless of how you use it. That means every time you transfer it, you might trigger gain or loss. That means taxes.These are old rules, and cryptocurrency hasn’t changed them. Property trades are taxed to both sides, even if one party just wants credit for later. Swapping one product or service for another is taxable, as the IRS explains at its Bartering Tax Center. Earning trade or barter dollars through a barter exchange is also taxable income, just as if your product or service was sold for cash. Plumbing for dental work? The IRS taxes it. You name the swap, it’s income to both sides. Both must report the fair market value of goods or services received on their tax returns.Most swaps of property are taxable to both sides, just like sales for money. There are exceptions for something called 1031 exchanges, but they may not apply to swaps of cryptocurrency. Besides, there are detailed rules to consider to comply with 1031. So, get some advice before you assume that any swaps might be tax free.IRS Notice 2014-21 says Bitcoin and other digital currency is property, but that doesn’t mean everyone holds cryptocurrency as a capital asset. If you are paid for services with it, that is ordinary income, and might even be wages. If you are a miner, you are earning ordinary income, perhaps even self-employment income. If you hold cryptocurrency and later sell it, whether you have capital gain or loss depends on whether it is a capital asset in your hands. For long-term treatment, you want to hold for more than a year. Keep good records too.The IRS is hunting digital currency users, using John Doe summonses to obtain data. The IRS is also hunting Bitcoin user identities with software. The IRS has a Chainalysis software contract to identify owners of digital wallets. Taxpayers with unreported income could face taxes, penalties, or even worse. Remember, the IRS also used a John Doe Summons to get names of Swiss bank account holders from UBS, and ended up collecting over $10 billion. The IRS may have cut its request for customer records from Coinbase to accounts with transactions over $20,000, but the IRS is clearly doing more data mining for digital currency users.Consider if you are paying an employee or independent contractor. Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable, and must be reported on a Form W-2. Plus, they are subject to withholding and payroll taxes. If you pay someone in property, how do you withhold taxes? You could pay some cash and some Bitcoin, and withhold plenty on the cash. Payments to independent contractors are taxable, and payers must issue Form 1099. When you pay an independent contractor and issue Form 1099, you can’t enter “1,000 Bitcoin” on the Form 1099. You must value it in dollars as of the time of payment.  If you use Bitcoin to buy a meal, that’s a taxable transaction to both sides. Currently, there’s no deal too small to attract the IRS. But that could change. A bipartisan bill, ""The CryptoCurrency Tax Fairness Act,"" was introduced in the House by Rep. Jared Polis (D-Co) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Az). It calls for tax exemption for all transactions under $600. But it hasn’t passed. Stay tuned.The IRS claims that only 802 people declared a capital gain or loss related to Bitcoin in 2015! This suggests that the vast bulk of Bitcoin transaction were not reported, at least in 2015. But in 2017, there is more awareness, and more fear. The current value of the cryptocurrency economy exceeds $200 billion. With millions of transactions and the meteoric rise of Bitcoin from under $100 to over $7,000 in just a few years, the IRS is gearing up.FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, is part of the Treasury Department. The FinCEN rules say Bitcoin exchanges and Bitcoin miners should register as Money Services Businesses, and comply with anti-money laundering regulations. Given the pressures now facing financial institutions to hand over account holders, and to withhold and remit taxes, we should expect more from FinCEN and the IRS. Remember, U.S. taxpayers must report worldwide income on their tax returns.Borrowers and lenders think of loans as non-taxable. There can be tax issues when loans are forgiven. Also, there may be interest income to lenders, and interest deductions to borrowers. Mostly, though, loans seem neutral from a tax viewpoint. You might think that loans in Bitcoin or other digital currency should be the same, but that’s not clear.When you receive a loan in cash, everyone understands that you will pay the lender back with other money. But the same is not necessarily true with a loan of property. In general, if you want to avoid taxes, a loan of property should require the return of the same property. With loans of cryptocurrency, the parties probably intend the cryptocurrency lent to be treated as fungible currency.But a borrower may receive Bitcoins and sell them, repaying the lender with other Bitcoins, or with other forms of cryptocurrency. It’s not clear if cryptocurrency loans will be taxed, but you should try to protect yourself in your loan documents if you are either borrowing or lending. Some suggestions appear here: IRS Could Tax Loans Of Bitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies.Taxes are complex. Be careful out there.Robert W.

Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of SegWit2x.”Bitcoin prices shot up immediately the news became public, reaching a new all-time high just under $8,000 before steeply reversing, followed by a bounceback to around $7,700.SegWit2x had received a barrage of opposition from across the Bitcoin industry, with its few supporters likewise coming under pressure to justify the hard fork.A lack of replay protection - a mechanism preventing coins being accidentally spent on both chains - was a major criticism that made even Nick Szabo come out against SegWit2x today.",42,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SegWit2x    #Bitcoin Price    #Hard Fork    #Nick Szabo

Then, we will utilize locktime to lock the spending of your coins (UTXOs) before a certain block,” the statement explains.“Once the transaction on the longer chain is confirmed, we will send a transaction with identical coins (UTXOs) on the shorter chain without the locktime.”As the last major hardware wallet provider to publish its treatment of SegWit2x, TREZOR’s confirmation comes as a relief to many anxious to know where to store their Bitcoins during the fork.Hints of a distaste for 2x had meanwhile previously surfaced from the company’s CTO Pavol Rusnak.In tweets late last month, the developer said BitPay’s ticker would no longer feature in TREZOR explicitly due to its support of the fork.“We're replacing BitPay exchange rates API in TREZOR Web Wallet because they plan to play games with the BTC ticker. Can't tolerate this,” he wrote.In its statement, 2x’s lack of replay protection formed the basis of TREZOR’s chosen plan of action, the feature having gained widespread condemnation across the Bitcoin community including pioneer Nick Szabo.The service’s web wallet will correspondingly show B2X balances should users split their coins, subject to a new derivation path TREZOR has chosen to implement.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #TREZOR    #SegWit2x    #Hard Fork    #BitPay    #Nick Szabo  
Crypto Trading Platform Starts Accepting CNY - New Era for Bitcoin in China?,Alex Gao,11/8/2017 12:30,27878,788,"Two months ago, when Chinese regulator issued the “Seven Regulatory Bodies” Announcement and shut down the Bitcoin trading, the whole world thought that China Bitcoin gates were closing. Though optimists were claiming that Chinese government might free Bitcoin trading under certain circumstances in the future, nobody anticipated that the day is coming this soon.On Nov. 1, ZB.com, a new cryptocurrency trading platform, began to serve sellers and buyers all over the world, including those in mainland China. ZB.com has become a major trading platform which provides trades of BTC, LTC, ETH, ETC and another major type of cryptocurrencies within a few days.What’s more, on Nov. 8, it started to accept CNY as a deposit. In other words, the CNY trading market which was closed by the regulators is activated now. The platform only accepts credit cards and debit cards for CNY deposit. WeChat Pay and Alipay are not accepted yet.Though it’s still too soon to state that Bitcoin trading is freed by the Chinese government, it's highly likely that the government, instead of banning Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is more interested in regulating the market and supervising the trading. Like it or not, a new era of Bitcoin in China is coming, and law and order might play a more significant role now.Do you think a new era of #Bitcoin in #China is coming?? ",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Cryptocurrencies    #Alipay    #Government  
"South Korea to Regulate Bitcoin as Commodity, Says Bank of Korea Governor",Lisa Froelings,10/29/2017 10:30,18920,1235,"South Korean central bank Bank of Korea (BOK) governor, Lee Joo-yeol, has announced that Bitcoin will be regulated as a commodity rather than as a currency. The governor, however, claimed that the central bank will not be launching the regulation very soon.During the audit of BOK by the National Assembly, Lee claimed that digital currencies like Bitcoin cannot be regarded as money based on the definition of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).“It is difficult to look at [virtual currencies] as money by [the definition] of Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Regulation (of virtual currencies) is appropriate because it is regarded as a commodity. It [cannot be] regulated at the level of a currency.”To promptly tackle the issues involving cryptocurrencies, the South Korean government created in 2016 a digital currency task force to study the regulatory and licensing parameters for Bitcoin and Bitcoin exchanges. In early June 2017, a CNN report stated that the participants in the study ‘failed to agree on whether cryptocurrencies should be included in systems right now and how the systems work if they are included.”Meanwhile, South Korea’s financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) has issued a ban on initial coin offerings (ICO) guided by the task force. The aim of the ban is to protect investors from possible fraud. This move has led to worries of a campaign against the local digital currency trading market in the country that is similar to the crackdown recently launched by the Chinese government.FSS vice chairman Kim Yong-bum was quoted at the time that ICOs increase the risk of fraud, so a ban will be implemented.“We are worried about adverse effects such as increased risk of fraud, the ICO will be prohibited in all forms.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies    #ICO

The charges have been filed in US District Court.Per the report, Stetkiw had been brokering Bitcoin transactions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars without the proper licensing required for monetary brokering. He had been using the website LocalBitcoins, and would meet his would-be clients at Tim Horton’s restaurant, going by the moniker ‘SaltandPepper.’As part of a sting operation, federal agents met the trader and purchased more than $55,000 in Bitcoin over the course of a number of meetings, with Stetkiw even brokering deals with out of state sellers. These activities are all licensed by state and federal agencies.The operation highlights the reality that Bitcoin is still within a widespread ‘adoption curve’ as the power of the decentralized currency is mitigated with the dangers of illegal activities.

SEC Enforcement Division Says ICOs a Vehicle For Fraud,Jon Buck,10/28/2017 10:25,10657,505,"During a speech given at a Securities Enforcement Forum on Thursday, the co-director of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Enforcement Division, Stephanie Avakian made it clear that the commission sees the need for strict digital enforcement when it comes to ICOs.While the SEC sees and affirms the power of Blockchain technology, they are nevertheless fully aware of the danger that such digital technologies pose as a vehicle for fraud. The risk toward investors and the general public must be mitigated, according to the commission’s view. The co-director said:“Blockchain technology presents many interesting issues and can of course present legitimate opportunities for raising capital. But, like many legitimate ways of raising capital, the popular appeal of virtual currency and Blockchain technology can be an attractive vehicle for fraudulent conduct. We think that creating a permanent structure for the consideration of these issues within the Cyber Unit will ensure continued focus on protecting both investors and market integrity in this space.”The SEC has already made it clear that they will treat tokens as securities in many cases, driving fear into the ICO market. These recent statements only reaffirm the reality that governments are increasingly seeing the need for oversight in the field.While this news may come as a negative for some, others have argued that clearing out the ‘riffraff’ of the ICO world would actually improve the overall marketplace.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Security    #ICO    #Fraud    #Bitcoin Exchanges  
"Singapore Will Not Regulate Cryptocurrencies, Singapore Official Says",Alex Gao,10/27/2017 17:20,19188,890,"Recently during an interview with Bloomberg, an official of Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which serves as the central bank and financial regulator of Singapore, said that MAS has no plans of regulating cryptocurrencies. The central bank will keep “an open mind,” though the official also stated the necessity of establishing anti-money laundering control in the future.During the interview, MAS Managing Director, Ravi Menon said that:“We’ve taken the approach that the currency itself does not pose the risk that warrants regulation. Our approach is to look at the activity around the cryptocurrency and then make an assessment of what regulation would be suitable.”“It is a known fact that cryptocurrencies are quite often abused for illicit financing purposes, so we do want to have AML/CFT controls in place. So those requirements apply to the activity around cryptocurrency, rather than the cryptocurrency itself.”What’s more, Menon, unlike most of other authorities, didn't undermine or criticize the cryptocurrencies. He said that if cross-border remittance through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is more convenient and efficient, the central bank and scholars should focus more on how to use Blockchain and cryptocurrencies to benefit more people. The scholars and professionals should consider whether cryptocurrencies could make cross-border inter-banking payments cheaper, faster and more efficient instead of merely thinking about the economic value of cryptocurrencies as investing products.Singapore has always been the advocate of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The MAS is one of the early adopters of Blockchain technology. On Oct. 25, Singapore and Hong Kong announced a cooperation on a cross-border trade project based on Blockchain technology by linking their trade finance platforms.With “an open mind,” Singapore could be one of the most important countries for the development of Blockchain technology. It also has the potential of being the hub of Blockchain technology in the future.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Singapore    #Cryptocurrencies    #Ravi Menon  
Algerian Government Eyes Total Ban on Cryptocurrencies,Joshua Althauser,10/27/2017 15:30,13660,356,"The government of Algeria appears to be moving towards a total ban of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the country. The government is reportedly considering the prohibition of the use, as well as possession of the virtual currencies and not just a ban on their acceptance as a form of payment.Based on a report by local paper Maghreb Emergent, the National People’s Congress (NPC) is currently tackling the 2018 Finance Bill that will declare the usage and ownership of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin as illegal in the country.Part of the bill reads:“Any violation of this provision is punished in accordance with the laws and regulations in force.”Based on the wordings of the bill, the government intends to establish tougher control on the use of cryptocurrencies in digital transactions. The bill also claims that the digital currencies may be used in such illegal activities as drug trafficking, money laundering and tax evasion due to the guaranteed anonymity of its users during a transaction.The bill defines Bitcoin as a “so-called virtual currency” that can be utilized by Internet users. It further states that the number one digital currency is characterized by the absence of physical support like banknotes, coins, bank cards or payments by check. These features of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the clear reasons why some countries like Algeria are showing grave concerns on their use and existence.Algeria is just one of the countries that are trying to take action on the use and proliferation of digital currencies. In Indonesia, the government has announced that it will not recognize Bitcoin as a legal form of currency. Because of this, a couple of major Bitcoin payment platforms in the country have decided to voluntarily stop their operations potentially similar to what happened to halted cryptocurrency exchanges in Indonesia.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banned Bitcoin    #Indonesia  
‘Clear Violation’? New York Authorities Challenged On SegWit2x BitLicense Rule-Breaking,William Suberg,10/27/2017 10:10,13532,444,"SegWit2x will result in cryptocurrency businesses operating in New York to break BitLicense rules “no matter the outcome” of the hard fork.An email sent to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) this week is causing more controversy over November’s planned chain split, accusing lawmakers of failing to act on legal obligations.“[...] This email requests that NYDFS enforce the provisions of the Virtual Currency License (“Bitlicenses”) on those entities that are licensed and other entities operating unlicensed virtual currency businesses in the State of New York,” it states.  “Several Bitlicensed entities are engaged in activities in clear violation of the Bitlicense codes, rules and regulations.”Making specific reference to NYA signees Xapo, Genesis Global Trading, Blockchain.info and Bitfury, author David Anderson suggests that violation of BitLicense rules is certain, regardless how SegWit2x turns out.“At a minimum, the parameters of the New York Agreement will encumber the virtual currency stored by the licensees by undermining the ability of users to withdraw their virtual currency,” he continued.“More likely, however, the New York Agreement will create a completely new type of virtual currency, different from the virtual currency originally stored by the licensees. The original type of virtual currency stored by the signees will become interoperable or will cease to exist altogether.  No matter the outcome, violations of Section 200.9 (b) and/or (c) will occur.”The legal aspects of the Bitcoin hard fork have rarely entered public debate, with Core developer Peter Todd subsequently picking up on the “interesting” idea.Interesting: legal argument that NYA/2X signers are aiming to control a cryptocurrency, which is regulated under Bitlicense. https://t.co/J3y5GuQMhMNot everyone was convinced, however, with Blockchain attorney Marco Santori describing Anderson’s arguments as “dumb and not interesting.”In Europe meanwhile, an equally unpopular idea came from Finnish Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge, who suggested that if 2x were to fail, miners should also abandon the already-active implementation of SegWit on the Bitcoin network.If #bitcoin doesn't upgrade to 2x as agreed, wouldn't it be reasonable that miners also roll back the first part of the agreement, Segwit?“There doesn't have to be wide support.

"Communist Congress is Over, Now What for Bitcoin Ban?",Darryn Pollock,10/24/2017 15:20,22846,525,"There was much speculation that China’s snap decision to firstly ban ICOs, and then take a hard-line approach to Bitcoin exchanges, was a power play ahead of the 19th Communist Congress.With that political flexing of the economic muscles out of the way, what is the new dawn for Bitcoin in the Socialist country?Many are feeling there is a new wave of optimism, however, when it comes to Bitcoin, others think that it is a totally different ball game.Gordon Chang, American columnist, blogger, television pundit, author and lawyer, has said that although the Congress was successful and there was optimism for the Socialist country, he does not sense liberalism on its way. Chang said:""There has been optimism that after the Communist Party's 19th National Congress there is going to be liberalization in many areas of the economy -- that is possible. But cryptocurrencies are something of a special case.""Chang is of the opinion that Bitcoin flies too much in the face of the controlling Chinese government and that unless there are massive liberal changes, the current regime will not stand for it.“The Chinese have been concerned that citizens can use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to expatriate money, and taking the capital controls and making a mockery of them, so there has been this clampdown on Bitcoin. I think it will continue,” Chang suggested ominously.“I think the most fascinating thing are comments from the People’s Bank of China, about China developing its own sovereign digital currency, sort of as a replacement for Bitcoin. This is going to be fascinating to watch because the Chinese central bank is going to want to have control and the reason why these cryptos are so popular is because they take control away from the government and give it to the people, so this is going to a struggle.”This indeed was the way in which Russia went about things as they banned access to Bitcoin exchanges, before announcing their own CryptoRuble.Chang says that the prediction that the banning of Bitcoin was a power play for the Congress is maybe not entirely true. The current regime is looking to control more of the economy, as well as the markets.“We have seen this so far, there has been the prohibition on ICOs and the closing of exchanges and everyone is thinking that this was in the run-up to the Congress. Under the current leadership, there has been an attempt to impose more control, not over only the economy but also the markets. So any sense of allowing Chinese citizens to export currency is just counter to what the government has been doing. I think what we will see is more of that trend after the Congress, but we will have to wait and find out - but I don't think signs are good for liberalization in the coming months,” Chang concluded.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banned Bitcoin    #China    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Cryptocurrencies    #Politics    #Digital Currency

A current package of regulations is due for release by the end of year, while politicians have expressed a desire to strictly limit cryptocurrency availability to regular consumers.Conversely, Bitcoin, Ethereum and ICOs have conspicuously entered mainstream consciousness in the country, with everything from restaurant menus to vodka emerging with a crypto theme.Burger King Russia was the world’s first example of a global fast food giant issuing its own cryptocurrency, Whoppercoin, this year.In addition, Russia’s largest bank Sberbank announced it had formally joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance last week.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Putin    #ICO    #Mining    #CNBC    #Cryptocurrencies

Now, Royal Bank of Canada CEO David McKay has said his piece, questioning its point and function in society.The Canadian bank boss sees Bitcoin as a way to move money around undetected, following in a long line of traditional investors who see Bitcoin as a dark art of currency.""The purpose Bitcoin seems to serve today is really to help move money in a hidden way and facilitate, potentially facilitate, criminal activity of moving money in an undetected way,"" McKay said.""I think some people will call it a fraud. I don't think it's fraudulent … But it doesn't solve a main need in society right now.""Because the CEO obviously works closely with fiat currency, it seems he is having difficulty in fathoming its deeper functions. McKay says he battles to see its legitimacy in comparison to other currencies.""A currency is a promissory note on a future good and service and economy. I hold a dollar, or a pound or a euro because I want to exchange it for a physical good or a service sometime in the future and I'm confident in holding that note because of the political system backing it, because of the strength of the economy, because of a central bank with reserves.""""So when you look at those characteristics and the real need for a currency, how do you apply that to a cryptocurrency? Most of those criteria don't fit; it's not backed by a government, it's not backed by the rule of law, it's not backed by economy, there's no reserve against it, you actually have to mine it in a distributed chain environment,"" said McKay.There is little doubting that Blockchain technology is here to stay, and there are many traditionalists that are getting excited about that technology while also shunning its offshoot, Bitcoin.McKay is in this same boat, backing the underpinning technology.""Most people in the world aren't talking about Bitcoin. They're talking about Blockchain, the distributed ledger private or public that underpins the Bitcoin application of it,"" said McKay.""It has a chance to transform everything from our capital markets, and our trading businesses, our security settlement businesses, right into our retail franchise. And so that technology, that ability to work in code and build solutions, are two new technologies and areas that we need.""",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Canada    #Banks    #Central Bank    #Government    #Jamie Dimon    #Christine Lagarde  
Bitcoin Goes Under the Hammer in Italy: Auctions and Crypto,Darryn Pollock,10/23/2017 16:46,18398,369,"An Italian auction house based in Rome has opened up to the world of cryptocurrencies, blending the old with the new, as it will allow its patons to settle their payments in Bitcoin.While mass adoption has been slow for Bitcoin and other related digital currencies, there have been more and more precedent-busting niche adoptions, such as this world first.The world of luxury and fine art have long been firm friends of Bitcoin. There was Cointemprorary, a gallery that was the first of its kind to offer unique art pieces solely for Bitcoin.Then, more recently, a fine art gallery in Mayfair, London, opened its doors on Bitcoin, allowing art to be bought with the digital currency.Now, Sant'Agostino will allow patriots of its auction to settle up in Bitcoin, opening up a world of furniture, jewelry, watches, as well as paintings to those with a few extra Bitcoin to spare.The first sale that the auction house opens to Bitcoin bidders is expected to have 600 Italian and foreign design objects, mostly pieces of furniture.There has not been much fanfare made of the Auction house’s decision to embrace this new form of monetary technology, they simply said in a statement: “Bitcoins will be accepted as payment"" for the upcoming sale.While debate continues to rage as to what Bitcoin is - a store of value, or a functioning currency - it’s decisions like that of the Italian auction house that legitimizes the digital currency for its core use.As its value rockets, however, there’s more interest for investors rather than consumers in the likes of Bitcoin, as it continues to break new boundaries in its value.However, it is also this astronomical growth that would be fueling early adopter's wallets, and allowing them to enter into auctions for luxury goods.Depending on where people stand on Bitcoin's use will continue to shape how it is utilized, and also determine if there is a demand for more adoption from retailers and the like.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Italy    #Cryptocurrencies

Australia: Regulator Says Cryptocurrency Exchange License Will ‘Strengthen Confidence’,William Suberg,4/11/2018 11:31,11498,301,"Australia has already licensed three cryptocurrency exchanges since new regulations came into effect April 3, but the remainder must begin compliance by May 14.In a press release April 11, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said that exchanges, which it calls “digital currency exchanges (DCEs),” have a “transition period” until next month to begin the newly-sanctioned registration process.“It’s recognised that this reform will help protect their business operations from money laundering and terrorism financing, while regulation will also help strengthen public and consumer confidence in the sector,” AUSTRAC CEO Nicole Rose commented.After spending several years battling a confusing and at times conflictory regulatory landscape, exchanges doing business in Australia can now take advantage of an official program in line with those adopted by Japan and South Korea.The cryptocurrency industry has traditionally welcomed such moves, which analysts say create a better impression of operators and facilitate trust in and adoption of crypto assets.In Japan, where a licensing scheme has operated since April 2017, even the significant hurdle of exchange Coincheck’s $530 mln hack in January failed to quell long-term optimism, online broker Monex Group confirming a $33.5 mln buyout last week.For AUSTRAC, Rose adds, regulation will also mean increased data sharing opportunities:“AUSTRAC now has increased opportunities to facilitate the sharing of financial intelligence and information relating to the use of digital currencies, such as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with its industry and government partners.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
China And Blockchain: Most Patents And More Governmental Funds,Joseph Young,4/11/2018 2:15,20073,848,"China already has the largest number of Blockchain patents in the world, beating global economies such as the US and Japan. Moreover, the Chinese government has just funded another $1.6 bln Blockchain fund to finance more projects in the cryptocurrency space.On April 9, Chinese publication Sohu reported that the government of Hangzhou has decided to invest more than $400 mln in a Hangzhou-based venture capital firm known as Tunlan Investment, to facilitate the growth of Blockchain startups and projects.Tunlan Investment, in cooperation with the Chinese government launched the Blockchain Industrial Park in Hangzhou, in an effort to spend over $1.6 bln on Blockchain projects, 30 percent of which will be funded by the local government. The initiative has already attracted advisors such as Zhenfund founder Xu Xiaoping, who has invested in projects like the Ethereum-based content distribution platform Steem and Lino.The funding of the Blockchain Industrial Park in Hangzhou is the latest effort by the Chinese government to fund and grow Blockchain projects.In Sept. 2017, the Chinese government imposed a complete ban on cryptocurrency trading and investment, terminating the relationship between financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges, and requesting local exchanges to move out of the country after seizing their services.Consequently, Huobi and OKCoin rebranded to Huobi Pro and OKEx, as they relocated to Hong Kong. In April the two exchanges, which were formerly the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges in China prior to the cryptocurrency trading ban, expanded into South Korea, a market that has been rapidly growing over the past six months.The recent initiative introduced by the Chinese government to finance Blockchain projects within China directly contradicts its decision to ban cryptocurrency trading seven months ago. At the time, the Chinese government stated that it considers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as a threat to the central bank and the current financial system of China.People’s Bank of China (PBoC) researcher and Central University of Finance and Economics professor Huang Zhen explained:“The sovereign state is still the fundamental player in global politics, and carries with it the characteristics of the world financial system. Cryptocurrencies and other virtual currencies attempt to challenge the sovereign state's right to issue currency, requiring the nationalization of currency issuance. China has a clear understanding of digital forms of money, and is actively engaging in relevant work. The central bank has set up a research group and a digital money research institute to explore the digitization of sovereign money.”Despite the government’s acknowledgement of decentralized cryptocurrencies as a threat to its financial and monetary system, the Chinese government is leading efforts to fund local Blockchain projects because they have embraced the technology behind Bitcoin. The Chinese government emphasized on several occasions that Blockchain technology has potential to disrupt the global financial structure.A recent paper released by state-owned newspaper The People’s Daily noted:“The mainstream Blockchain technology platforms all originated from abroad. The domestic Blockchain technology service providers should patiently start from the ground floor to make technologies independent and controllable, and strive to lead global Blockchain technology development.”Over the past year, the Chinese government has followed the roadmap by allowing domestic Blockchain projects to start from the ground floor to commercialize the Blockchain. This positive stance towards Blockchain technology also explains the recent effort by the government of Hangzhou to provide $400 mln to Blockchain projects.According to Thomson Reuters and the World Intellectual Patent Organization, China has about 400 Blockchain-related patents, which it has garnered within the past two years. The US and Australia have the second largest number of blockchain patents with 110 and 40 respectively.As Cointelegraph reported on April 1, Chinese companies have been utilizing Blockchain technology to lead pilot tests and process data in real-time and in a decentralized manner. AliPay and TencentPay, two of the biggest FinTech applications in China, have expressed their optimism towards implementing Blockchain-based payment systems, and some insurance companies have already started to use Blockchain.JD.com, a major Chinese retailer is currently using Blockchain technology to track the shipping of domestic and international beef products, and insurance firm ZhongAn have been utilizing Blockchain-based systems to trace and monitor the life cycles of poultry.“[JD.com plans to] partner with innovative Blockchain startups to build new businesses and create and test real-world applications of their technologies at scale. We are excited to work with some of the world’s most innovative startups to explore ways we can scale these cutting edge technologies for the future of retail and other industries, as well,” said JD.com in a statement.The Chinese government is undergoing a learning curve. It has acknowledged that the Blockchain is a disruptive technology that could revolutionize a wide range of industries including finance. The government’s positive viewpoint towards Blockchain technology could potentially lead to friendlier cryptocurrency regulations.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Tradings  
UK National Cyber Security Centre Includes Cryptojacking In Report On Cyber Threats,Ana Alexandre,4/11/2018 1:06,12291,207,"On April 10, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) released a report analyzing how nefarious cyber activity influenced the business environment in Great Britain over the past year.The report dedicates a section to cryptojacking, a form of cyber attack in which a hacker utilizes an individual’s computer, without the owner’s knowledge, to mine cryptocurrencies. Often the only way to notice that a device is being cryptojacked is a slight slowdown in performance.The NCSC believes that, with the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, methods of digital currencies mining via users’ CPU power, such as cryptojacking, will probably become a steady source of revenue for website owners and hackers. According to the report:“The technique of delivering cryptocurrency miners through malware has been used for several years, but it is likely in 2018-19 that one of the main threats will be a newer technique of mining cryptocurrency which exploits visitors to a website.”The report states that incidences of cryptojacking increased in 2017. In December 2017, 55 percent of businesses worldwide were impacted by cryptocurrency miners. In February 2018, more than 4,000 websites globally (including about 600 in the UK) secretly mined digital currency with compromised screen-reading plugins designed for blind and partially sighted people.The NCSC believes that the majority of cryptojacking is performed by cyber criminals. However, website owners have also targeted visitors and utilized the CPU power of visitors’ computers to mine cryptocurrency to their own advantage.In past years, malware has proven itself to be an effective technique for mining cryptocurrencies through exploiting common users’ software vulnerabilities. Last month, Microsoft’s Windows Defender Antivirus blocked over 400,000 attempts of malware to infect users with a cryptocurrency miner in a 12 hour span.In January, the Opera web browser announced they would add anti-crypto mining to their mobile browser after including it in their integrated ad blocker for desktop.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #UK    #Security    #Crimes  
Japan: Self-Regulatory Group Study Reveals 3.5 Mln Active Crypto Investors,William Suberg,4/10/2018 13:45,11724,259,"Japan delivered new statistics about cryptocurrency use on Tuesday, April 10 as regulators and industry players push for greater transparency in the country’s market.A report from Japan’s self-regulatory body the Japanese Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) revealed at a meeting of a study group commissioned by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) analyzed various data from 17 major exchanges in 2017.The meeting was the first for the study group, which focuses specifically on issues related to the cryptocurrency exchange industry.Figures presented paid special attention to the giant rises in volume attributed to cryptocurrency investment, Japan having risen to become the world’s biggest trading market last year.From just $22 mln annual trading volume in 2014, Bitcoin rose to $97 bln in 2017 – an increase of 340,000 percent in three years.Secondary trading options involving margins, credit and futures exploded even more in the same period – from $2 mln in 2014 to $543 bln in 2017.Last year in Japan, 3.5 million active investors participated in the domestic market.The FSA continues to reshape the integrity of the cryptocurrency exchange arena in Japan after Coincheck’s $530 mln hack in January sent ructions through international markets.Inspections, penalties and shutdowns of exchanges have followed in recent months, despite Coincheck earning a sudden reprieve last week when online broker Monex Group confirmed a buyout worth $33.5 mln, plus “contingency payment”.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Tradings  
"2018 ‘Mature’ Crypto Market Will Draw More Investment, See Less Volatility, Analyst Says",Marie Huillet,4/9/2018 23:05,24522,481,"Adrian Lai, founding partner of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Orichal Partners, has forecast that in 2018 the crypto market will “mature” and increase its trading volume, particularly among institutional investors, the South China Morning Post reported April 9.Lai characterized both last year’s eye-popping market cap growth — reaching an all-time high of over $800 bln by early Jan. 2018 — and its subsequent first quarter spiral to $256 mln, as of today, April 9, as “irrational.” He attributed this staggering volatility to a lack of regulatory oversight and institutional investment, but struck a decisively optimistic tone about the future, saying that:“Regulators are not banning the development of cryptocurrencies, but are trying to better regulate the market, which should help the industry mature (…) If the regulatory stance gets clearer, large funds will be more assured and willing to commit significant capital.”2018 has already seen considerable regulatory momentum pertaining to the crypto sphere, lending credence to Lai’s position. The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) hearings in Feb. 2018 were devoted to crypto regulation.The US, Japan, and South Korea are all currently debating and issuing regulation for virtual currencies, Blockchain, crypto exchanges and ICOs, as well as considering taxation frameworks, with some admitting that regulatory measures are not fully developed.In January, Cointelegraph reported that venture capital (VC) Blockchain investment in 2018 is already on track to exceed 2017’s numbers, with notable investments including $140 mln VC already raised from Goldman Sachs, Baidu, and CICC for Circle’s recent acquisition of the Poloniex crypto exchange, as well as VC Firm Digital Currency Group’s investment in crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Markets    #Investments    #Volatility  
What Do Recent Legislative Developments Mean For Crypto Users Privacy,Kirill Bryanov,4/9/2018 19:25,19464,326,"The last few weeks have been tense for those who take privacy issues seriously. First, there was Edward Snowden with yet another massive NSA leak, substantiating the suspicions, already thick in the air, that intelligence services are really after Bitcoin users’ personal information. Then, in the midst of the fallout from the news that Facebook had casually handed the private data of its 87 mln users to an unsavory electioneer firm, US Congress sneaked in a major piece of online privacy legislation, known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act.The document was tagged onto the coattails of a trillion-something-dollar omnibus spending bill, and therefore had no chance for any earnest legislative review of its own. Despite the initial uproar that it stirred among both online privacy activists and some prominent figures in the crypto community, the immediate public concern for the issue appears to be fading. Let’s not dismiss it as quickly, though: while the CLOUD Act’s implications on privacy regulation are already kicking in profoundly, it is worthwhile to take a thorough look at what’s inside the law and what it holds for cryptocurrency users.Sponsored by a soon-to-be-retired Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, the bill found few outspoken opponents on the Capitol Hill. The notable yet unsurprising exception was the libertarian Rand Paul, who unleashed a series of fiery tweets on the Act in the days building up to the vote. The most prominent public opposition came from a lineup of advocacy groups: a coalition led by The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which in a letter called the Act nothing but “a grave threat to civil liberties,” as well as from the aforementioned Electronic Frontier Foundation, the group that voiced concerns about the CLOUD Act’s potential to enable the government to circumvent the Fourth Amendment.For an outside observer, it might seem counter-intuitive that the united front of the tech’s big guns, including Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Oath, had earlier pledged unanimous support for the initiative that is designed to urge them to share users’ data with the government. Yet, it starts to make much more sense if you factor in the years-long courtroom thriller that came to be known as United States v. Microsoft Corp. A now-Supreme Court case, it deals with exactly the same issue as the one the CLOUD Act addresses. That is, whether an American tech company can refuse to comply with a court-ordered search warrant that seeks access to user data stored on a server outside of the United States.The case emerged with regard to a 2013 federal government’s warrant ordering Microsoft to turn over to law enforcement an email stored at its Irish data center. Supreme Court should have made its decision this summer; by all projections, Microsoft’s chances to emerge victorious were slim. The Supreme Court’s likely reversal of the circuit decision (which was in favor of Microsoft) would have created a clear precedent for all similar cases to come – the one that big tech wouldn’t like at all.The CLOUD Act presents a more palatable way out of this gridlock for communication platforms. Not only it lays down a nonambiguous legal framework to go by in similar cases but also provides the US companies with a firmer vantage point when handling such requests vis-à-vis foreign governments. The Department of Justice has already initiated the process of nullifying the case, while both Supreme Court justices and Microsoft representatives seemed anything but disappointed with the United States v. Microsoft Corp. going moot.Essentially, the Act does two things with the data that American tech companies store. First of all, it extends the US government’s jurisdictional reach over them, regardless of the hosting data center physical location. Furthermore, it redefines the rules of the US international cooperation over data matters, simplifying the procedure and almost entirely relieving it of judicial review.The first clause is quite straightforward. From the day the CLOUD Act is signed into law, all data hosted by any American provider anywhere in the world is a fair game for the US law enforcement, from local police to feds. If there is a court-ordered warrant, it has to be honored. However, it is the international cooperation part that appears to be the most contentious. The Act compels the US providers of electronic communication services (ECS) or remote computing services (RCS) to honor the same requests from foreign governments who have signed bilateral agreements with the United States.The CLOUD Act amends the 1986 Stored Communications Act, from where it also draws the antiquated language of the ECS’s and RCS’s. Under the old law, the international procedure included signing Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs), agreements that required Congressional approval. The new legislation eliminates the legislative review and vests the power to approve bilateral agreements in the executive, namely the attorney general and the secretary of state.In effect, this means that the executive branch gets to unilaterally decide which governments are granted access to Facebook and Google users’ data. The law contains the language compelling the US officials to ensure that the partner nation’s legal system has robust enough protections for citizens’ privacy, and the requests do not serve to abridge free speech. Yet privacy advocates cite the vagueness of these formulations and lack of concrete criteria that the executive is to apply. Another big concern is that under the CLOUD Act, unlike the law it had amended, foreign governments’ requests for data can be approved without going to a US court.While privacy advocates complain about all the discretion that the Act endows the executive with, along with the general lack of procedural transparency and oversight, some legal minds suggest that the new system might actually prove more efficient than the MLATs-based one. The ongoing requests will be settled quickly without the need to wait for months and months for a Congressional approval.Overall, the experts envision a world where the United States would form a “club” of like-minded nations with similar legal systems. Members of this club, bound by bilateral agreements with the US, will cooperate extensively in sharing user data for law enforcement purposes. The data stored in non-member countries will still be accessible to the US officials on court order, but the hosting countries’ national laws will become irrelevant in such cases.The major problem that any government has with cryptocurrencies is that they allow for anonymous transactions. Now, the catch is that most of the cryptocurrencies are not anonymous, as the popular line goes, but rather pseudonymous. Once it becomes possible to link, say, a Bitcoin address to its owner’s identity, the public ledger is wide open to track down all the transactions that have ever gone through the person.Governments have an obvious interest in establishing such links. Forensic analysis of Blockchains has grown into a lucrative industry, with leading enterprises such as Chainalysis and Elliptic cooperating with law enforcement agencies globally. We have learned well that the IRS is eager to know crypto traders’ identities for the sake of taxing their gains, while the NSA wants to trace every satoshi that had ever possibly gone through terrorist supply chains. The incentives and the tools are both in place. Now, the CLOUD Act comes in.The first question is the scope of the law. Which companies will be compelled to turn users’ private details over to the US and foreign governments? As in the Stored Communications Act of 1986, the language is still all about good old providers of “electronic communication services” and “remote computing services”– the spirits from the early days of the internet. But who are those? Over more than three decades of rulings, courts have applied these labels to all sorts of entities, from a city providing pager services to its police officers, to an airline that ran a centralized electronic booking system. The good news is that in all these cases organizations deemed ECSP’s were actually allowing for exchange and storage of messages; simply keeping user’s personal data did not automatically make a website qualify as an ECSP. Under this logic, online exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, which do not allow for users to exchange messages, would be out of the scope of the Act. Then again, we all remember too well that IRS has its own means of compelling crypto exchanges to turn over user’s data.Within the scope of the CLOUD Act, though, there are companies that directly facilitate communication: email services, social networking platforms, and messengers. It might seem not that big of a deal on the face – after all, who shares their BTC wallet addresses on Facebook? We don’t have surveys on that one, but common sense suggests that not so few. Before a crypto transaction can take place, the parties should somehow communicate all the necessary details to each other, and not everyone uses encrypted messengers for that end. Personal communications are therefore potentially rife with details that are at least indirectly related to people’s crypto identities.Under the Fourth Amendment, the government can only look for the evidence that the court-ordered search warrant authorizes it to look for. If, say, the police is inside someone’s house looking for a dead body, the pack of weed that they happen to spot under the kitchen sink cannot be used in court as the evidence of an unrelated crime that the deputies had occasionally discovered along the way. Well, at least that is how it is supposed to work. Similarly, when the NSA sifts through a suspect’s email for terrorist propaganda and comes across the BTC wallet addresses of all presumptively innocent people with whom the suspect had ever transacted for unrelated ends, they should leave this information alone. However, the temptation is there not to. And with lack of oversight, the temptation gets even greater.The software that the “Blockchain detective” startups rely on performs network analysis to identify clusters of associated wallets. The efficiency of this kind of inference is proportional to the amount of data that is the input to the model. Thus, there is a clear incentive for investigators to have the most complete data even on those who are not directly involved in crimes, so that they can better chart the Blockchain network. Recent Snowden revelations illustrated how intelligence services are ready to go to great lengths in obtaining crypto users’ data, and how unscrupulous they may be in choosing the means of doing so. Of course, where there are tools like tapping into raw backbone traffic and creating whole bogus VPN services at play, unauthorized collection of incidental user data while searching under legitimate warrants might seem not a big deal. However, it is still a feasible scenario under which law-abiding citizens, which the vast majority of crypto users are, can lose control over their personal data.If that is what the US intelligence agencies routinely do already, the passage of the CLOUD Act is unlikely to make a whole lot of difference beyond granting them potential access to even more data stored by domestic telecoms. What makes the Act profoundly consequential on the global scale, though, is that it could provide as wide latitude to other countries’ law enforcement. For sure, these governments will not be among the most oppressive ones, but the lack of due process in approving bilateral agreements, as well as the lack of judicial oversight in handling individual requests for data, might produce an environment where the power of law enforcement to request and use personal information of Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail users around the world goes almost entirely unchecked.Intimidating as it sounds, there is also another possibility that privacy advocates tend to consider less frequently: that the new rules for data use could prove efficient in helping law enforcement do their job. While this remains quite possible, it is also true that very soon more people, in raw numbers, will be getting access to more sensitive data, among which your wallet address and crypto transactions may accidentally come across. If this thought makes you uncomfortable, following Andreas Antonopoulos’ advice and “going dark” remains a good option.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Congress    #Privacy    #Government  
"How Anonymous Is the Purchase of Crypto? Regulations, Practice, Risks",Robin La Quercia,4/9/2018 17:10,14029,334,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.In a worldwide environment where privacy is constantly under threat, purchase of cryptocurrencies is not an exception. In the early stage of this market, as the number of users and exchanges was not significant, the formalities around the identification of the users were not widespread. However, over the course of the years, the situation changed.Criticisms on the anonymity of many Bitcoin users and the perceived risk that cryptocurrencies were used as a way of money laundering or for other illicit activities, increased the attention of international regulators.During the latest AMA (Ask me anything) meeting, when Bill Gates was asked for his general thoughts on cryptocurrencies, he responded:“The main feature of cryptocurrencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The [government’s] ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.”On the other side, Edward Snowden talking about Zcash (cryptocurrency aimed at using cryptography to provide enhanced privacy for its users), defined it as “the most interesting Bitcoin alternative,” adding:”Bitcoin is great, but if it's not private, it's not safe.”The proliferation of cryptocurrencies and their constant increase in negotiation volumes has increased the attention of different national and international authorities. As of 31 December 2015, the daily volume of cryptocurrencies trading was $46 mln, whereas during the same day of 2017 this arrived at $12,136 mln (hence representing a 26,283 percent increase)Image source: CoinmarketcapUnited StatesIn the US exchange platforms have to comply with the Anti-money Laundering (ALA) and Know your customer (KYC) regulations. The ALA/KYC regulations are intended to strengthen the measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute money laundering and the financing of terrorism and require the subjected entities, to establish written customer identification programs, with the aim of:European UnionIn the EU exchange platforms have to comply with the international standards issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), then complemented by national rules. The FATF framework prohibits the subjected entities, from keeping anonymous accounts or accounts in fictitious names. These institutions should be required to undertake customer due diligence measures when:AsiaAs many Asian countries are part of the FATF, the established framework also applies to them. South Korea, representing one of the world's biggest Bitcoin exchanges where cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among national investors along the course of the years, has recently banned anonymous trading of cryptocurrencies and requires the subjected entities to verify their customers properly.A government official of Japan said on March 13, the country will urge its G20 counterparts at the March meeting to beef up efforts to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering. The meeting then set a firm deadline to July for providing recommendations on how to regulate cryptocurrencies globally.The implementation of these regulations have also been encouraged by the International Monetary Fund, whose head Christine Lagarde recognizes the potential of the Blockchain technology and praises the work of FATF as “useful guidance to countries on how to deal with cryptocurrencies and other electronic assets.”Today, exchange platforms all around the world have to put in place procedures in order to be compliant with ALA/KYC regulations, hence requiring new clients to go through an identity verification process.Coinbase, a digital currency wallet and platform where merchants and consumers can transact with new digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, requires new clients to go through an identity verification process.In some instances, different stages of verifications are required, based on the services used by the clients. Kraken a San Francisco-based company, founded in 2011, requires different stages of verifications, that change based on the services used by the clients. The steps go from Tier 0, where the client can look around but can't deposit, withdraw or make any trades, and where only the email address is required, to Tier 4 where the clients are required to upload a valid Government ID, a recent proof of residence, a signed application form and KYC documents.Despite the efforts of regulators anonymous trading is still possible, mainly through:1) peer to peer trading platforms that allow users to trade Bitcoins for traditional currencies through person-to-person trades.For example, Localbitcoins is a platform where users post advertisements where they state exchange rate and payment methods for buying or selling Bitcoins. An interested buyer replies to these advertisements and agrees to meet the person to buy Bitcoins with cash, or trade directly with online banking.2) decentralized exchanges built into Bitcoin wallets that help to arrange local trades between buyers and sellers. For example, Mycelium Local Trader help arrange the trade between buyers and sellers, manage the transaction, and calculate reputation ratings based on the trades.These platforms don’t require ID verification or any personal information besides an email address to sign up.In addition to online platforms, Bitcoin ATMs allow a person to exchange Bitcoins and cash. Some Bitcoin ATMs offer bi-directional functionality enabling both the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the redemption of Bitcoin for cash. Another functionality is the possibility to send cash-to-cash payments to other people resident in different countries by using two Bitcoin ATMs. The diffusion of these machines is today very capillary as they can be found in more than 65 countries, in the main important cities.Anonymous trading comes at risks. The first one could be related to the use of cash for settling the transactions through peer-to-peer platforms. The direct exchange of cash between unknown buyers and sellers poses security risks, which the feedback system of the users only partially mitigated.The second risk is related to scams. The absence of a central entity that functions as a market settler, may not guarantee the two parties that the transactions will be successfully finalized. LocalBitcoins has a forum dedicated to this issue where suspected users are constantly signaled to the community.The third risk could be connected the tightening of the regulatory framework around the cryptocurrencies. On Feb. 23, the Financial Action Task Force announced that it “will step up its efforts in the understanding of the misuse and risk of virtual currencies.” After that, on March 7, the SEC required that platforms trading digital assets to register with the agency.As the trading of cryptocurrencies is still at an initial stage, the rules around identifications of the users are not uniforms and some countries are stricter than others. The US and the EU are front-lining the regulatory environment, requiring the exchange platforms to be compliant with the AML/KYC regulations.  Peer-to-peer transactions and the use of ATM services still allow, with some risks, interested users to transact without disclosing their personal information.International prosecutors are also catching up the cryptocurrency environment. As Ryan Schoen, senior financial services policy analyst at Washington Analysis said:""I think the next step here will likely be subpoenas to exchanges if they haven't already started.""As a result, in the short term, it could be expected that national and international authorities would strengthen further the regulatory framework around exchange platforms and cryptocurrencies trading.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Anonymity    #USA    #EU    #Asia  
UK Financial Regulator To Release Crypto Review This Year With BoE And Treasury,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/9/2018 12:25,11668,204,"The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will be publishing a review of cryptocurrencies this year in conjunction with the Treasury of the UK and the Bank of England (BoE), according to the FCA’s business plan for 2018/2019.At the end of March, the Treasury of the UK had announced the creation of a cryptocurrency task force with the BoE and the FCA to look into how to both regulate and support crypto technologies. The FCA had also reported the release of a global fintech regulatory sandbox for testing fintech innovation without needing to wait for regulatory approval.Under a section entitled “Cross-sector priorities,” the FCA details in their business plan how they plan to approach the speed with which fintech innovation is driving change in markets:“Our approach is to sustain a regulatory environment where consumers and firms can maximise the opportunities of competition, innovation and big data while reducing or mitigating the associated harms.”Cryptocurrencies are listed among the “key activities” of the FCA Innovate program, the FCA’s way of assisting firms with the regulatory guidelines in exchange for keeping up with new market trends like “initial coin offerings and distributed ledger technology.”The FCA report reads that although cryptocurrencies “are not currently within our regulatory perimeter [...] some models of use or packaging cryptocurrencies bring them within our perimeter, making the landscape complex.” The FCA also notes that they have already released guidelines for dealing with cryptocurrency derivatives, including futures, contracts for differences (CFD), and options.The FCA will continue to monitor the “number of new entrants to the market and the emergence of new innovative products to meet consumer needs” as a way to see if fintech is helping “improve competition in the interest of customers.”The question of how to regulate cryptocurrencies across the European Union has varied options put forward, with the BoE governor suggesting in March that the crypto ecosystem should be held to the same standards as the traditional financial system.The chairperson of the European Banking Authority has said that prohibiting banks and financial institutions from holding and selling crypto may be easier than direct regulation of cryptocurrencies, while a draft of a G20 documents reads that the group may consider crypto as an asset rather than a currency.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #UK    #Bank of England    #Central Bank    #Cryptocurrencies    #FinTech

"Gov’t-Issued Digital Currencies Threaten Financial Stability, Says Swiss Central Banker",Veronika Rinecker,4/9/2018 3:53,23445,307,"According to Swiss National Bank (SNB) governing board member Andréa Maechler, private cryptocurrencies have advantages over central bank digital currencies (CBDC), Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reported Sunday, April 8.The SNB board member told an audience in Zurich that private-sector digital currencies are better and less risky than nationally-issued versions. Furthermore, she added that a government-issued cryptocurrency could increase the risk of so-called ""bank runs"" – when a large number of customers withdraw funds from a bank based on concerns about the bank’s solvency.Speaking to the potential risks a CBDC could have for financial stability, she argued:""Digital central bank money for the general public is not necessary to ensure an efficient system for cashless retail payments. It would deliver scarcely any advantages, but would give rise to incalculable risks with regard to financial stability.""The central banker also sees problems with decentralized cryptocurrencies, namely that they can not compete effectively with traditional currency requirements. Meachler referenced that cryptocurrency lacked the requirements of money, referring to its applications as a medium of exchange, a vehicle for long-term value retention, and a stable unit of account.Maechler also acknowledged that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), of which Blockchain is a type, has the potential to reduce costs and increase transparency in the area of ??international money transfers. However, in terms of data security and reliability, she remarked that DLT does no meet the requirements of RTGS (Real-Time-Gross-Settlement) payment systems.Her negative attitude towards the concept of a national digital currency stands in contrast to the positions of other nations around the globe, whose central banks have been actively researching the topic.As recently as Thursday, April 5, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced that it is looking into issuing its own CBDC. In March, the deputy governor the People's Bank of China expressed interest in creating a state-issued cryptocurrency to bolster the Chinese Yuan (RMB).

Three More Countries Join Planned Lawsuit Against Internet Giants For Banning Crypto Ads,Helen Partz,4/9/2018 1:58,28542,987,"Cryptocurrency and Blockchain organizations in Switzerland, Kazakhstan, and Armenia have recently joined those of Russia, China, and South Korea in filing a joint lawsuit against major Internet companies for banning crypto-related advertising, local Russian news outlet RNS reported Friday, April 6.The plans to file the joint lawsuit against tech giants Google, Twitter, and Facebook were first revealed on March 27. The organizations originally filing the complaint include the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB), the Korea Venture Business Associations, and LCBT, a Chinese association of crypto investors.According to Yury Pripachkin, the president the RACIB, the new members of the joint lawsuit include such associations as Swiss InnMind fintech firm, the Armenian Blockchain Association, and the Kazakhstan Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association.The joint lawsuit is set to be filed in May 2018 in New York. Funds for lawyers are to be collected on a digital wallet registered in Estonia, Pripachkin noted.On Jan. 30, Facebook banned advertiserments related to cryptocurreny and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), citing “misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” In March, Google followed the move by announcing it woukd begin blocking crypto-relared ads of all types in June 2018. At the end of March, Twitter confirmed that it will also ban crypto-related ads, such as ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services, unless they are public companies.Recently, Johnl McAfee, a software engineer and very prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, disclosed that he charges $105,000 per tweet to promote cryptocurrency projects and related products, despite earlier denying that his promotional tweets are paid.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Switzerland    #Kazakhstan    #Russia    #China    #South Korea    #ICO    #Google  
"Malta Determined To Become the ‘Blockchain Island’: Regulations, Adoption, Binance Headquarters",Hector Sanchez,4/9/2018 1:29,32664,730,"Malta has made it obvious that it wants to become the “Blockchain island” and it seems determined to achieve its goal.A notable confirmation that Malta is moving in the right direction regarding Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulation was the recent announcement by Binance. The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by volume chose Malta for their new headquarters after the warnings received from Japan, China and Hong Kong.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as “CZ”, welcomed other projects to Malta such as Tron:Justin knows where the party is. Welcome to Malta $tron. https://t.co/CX7qtsgOWUSilvio Schembri, Junior Minister for Financial Services, Digital Economy & Innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta, commented to Cointelegraph on the news:“Binance’s decision is a vote of confidence in what we’re offering as a country and as a Government in this sector, that is legal certainty in this space. During the meeting with CZ I explained our long-term vision reflected in the policy document that was launched in February, ‘Malta - A leader in DLT Regulation.’ We are not shying away but instead want to unleash the opportunities that holds by regulating the sector without stifling innovation. Ultimately our vision is to make Malta ‘The Blockchain Island’.”Binance wants to offer fiat-to-cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals which will improve its liquidity and open their platform to new investors entering the space with fiat purchases. Currently, very few exchanges offer this option, which forces investors to look for other hedging alternatives such as the stable token Tether to protect themselves from the high volatility and correlation of the cryptocurrency markets.Malta has warmly welcomed Binance, which hopes to start soon partnerships with local Maltese banks to enable fiat-to-cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals within a few months.The second goal of Binance’s roadmap in Malta is to mitigate the risk posed by their centralized system and provide their customers with a decentralized and trustless solution not only due to an ever increasing demand for ultimate security and transparency but also because of the competition that centralized platforms will face from projects such as Polkadot or Cosmos Network.These new interoperability entrants, by implementing solutions such as ""Peggy"" (Ethereum Peg Zone), could trigger the raise of a new kind of decentralized exchanges which can be based on, for example, the 0x protocol, allowing for not only token but also cross Blockchain value exchange.Furthermore, in the near future, these exchanges could be done in a fully anonymous manner thanks to other interconnected privacy focused chains such as ZCash and its Zk-STARKs or Sentinel Security and its built-in coin mixer.It is therefore unsurprising that one of the goals of Binance in Malta would be to develop its own decentralized exchange given their awareness of all the upcoming innovations and potential competitors.Ian Gauci, legal expert for the National Blockchain Strategic Task Force within the Office of the Prime Minister, provided Cointelegraph with his opinion about Binance’s decision to move to Malta:“Usually operators opening in Malta would look at the whole ecosystem and assess the country’s potential from that angle. On the DLT front, Malta builds on the excellent reputation and track record in gaming, maritime and financial services. Hence, in my view, the value is already there. This value is further augmented by the country’s predisposition to DLT and innovation and the recent announcements on the intended legislative framework in this sector. I believe this was a crucial aspect in attracting Binance and in all likelihood other outfits on DLT and in the crypto sphere might share Binance’s view and likewise come to Malta.” Also, a founding member of the Blockchain Malta Association, Leon Siegmund, shared with Cointelegraph his thoughts about the current developments in DLT regulation in Malta:“Entrepreneurs in the Blockchain field need a business environment and clear, simple rules that are long-term guaranteed. Binance delivers a service trusted by millions of users worldwide and provides high quality employment of which the Maltese economy will benefit. Ultimately, it is undoubtedly clear that blockchain and Bitcoin is beyond the stage of being just a hype or underground experiment with millions of people investing -  it will bring decades of prosperity.”Malta has been proactive and efficient in its efforts to provide a legal framework for DLT. A consultation document related to the enactment of three proposed pieces of legislation was open for feedback until early March. These three pieces of legislation are summarized as follows:Firstly, the MDIA Bill will consist on the establishment of an authority, the “MDIA”. The Minister responsible for Digital Economy will select the Chairman and Board of Governors of the MDIA. The MDIA Bill will also establish the Joint Co-ordination Board (JCB) and its scope will be to ensure effective cooperation between MDIA and other National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in the area of technology uses.Moreover the MDIA Bill will establish the National Technology Ethics Committee (NTEC) which will ensure that the proper standards of ethics are reflected in the use of relevant Technology Arrangements and to guide other NCAs in Malta.The second piece of legislation will be the TAS Bill which will set out the regime for the registration of Technology Service Providers (auditors and administrators of TechnologyArrangements) and the certification of Technology Arrangements (DLT platforms and related smart contracts).The MDIA will be the national competent authority responsible for these registrations and certifications. The proposition is that any person will be able, on a voluntary basis, to request the MDIA to certify a Technology Arrangement or to register a Technology Service Provider.Finally, the VC Bill will provide the regulatory regime and framework for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and for the provision of certain services related to VCs. This regime will cover brokers, exchanges, wallet providers, advisors, wealth managers and market makers dealing in VCs.Some examples of practical applications of the above proposed legislation would be the certification of a DLT platform or the approval of an ICO. The proposed framework is intended to be pragmatic and applied to regulate the carrying on of business related to VCs when falling out of scope of existing European Union (EU) or Maltese financial services legislation.A “Financial Instrument Test” will be applied to issuers and/or persons offering ICOs conducted in or from Malta to determine whether an ICO/VC is classified as a financial instrument in terms of existing investment services legislation such as the Markets In Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).This “Financial Instrument Test” will have two stages. The first one will be to determine whether a particular VC falls under EU or Maltese existing legislation. The second stage would then determine whether the VC qualifies as an asset under the VC Bill. An affirmative determination during the first stage would not require the person undertaking the test to proceed to the second stage.The prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, and Silvio Schembri, Junior Minister for Financial Services, Digital Economy & Innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister, tweeted about their enthusiasm, leadership and constant meetings with operators within the DLT sphere wishing to move to Malta:Today we issued a document which provides guidance on the use of #DLT and #Crypto #Currency in #Gaming in #Malta. #blockchain #DeltaSummit https://t.co/ero5NBaruELedger projects based in Malta have created LP 01, the first DLT application in Malta consisting of a property transfer management system to facilitate notarial work. This platform could be a useful tool for authorities to access real-time data about sales of property in Malta.Also, E&S, which is a leading boutique law firm in Malta, would offer services related to ICOs such as ICO set-up, legal services or tokenomics. Several companies are already accepting Bitcoin payments in Malta and there are Bitcoin ATMs present as well. This illustrates a growing use of DLT in Maltese society.The local press is also discussing DLT issues frequently as can be seen in some recent articles from Times of Malta, Lovin Malta or Malta Independent.The frictions among regulations, privacy protection and innovation continue. However, while some countries choose not to dialogue or embrace these breakthrough DLT innovations by updating and improving their existing legislation, other countries such as Malta have the courage and initiative to be pioneer leaders. Malta, with the proposed legislation and Binance’s announcement to move its headquarters there, is quickly positioning itself firmly to truly become the “Blockchain island”.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Malta    #Binance    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Decentralization  
"Petition To Reverse Indian Central Bank’s Crypto Ban Gains 17,000 Signatures",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/8/2018 19:59,22433,660,"A Change.org petition for “Mak[ing] India at the forefront of Blockchain Applications Revolution” in response to the Indian central bank ending all dealings with crypto-related accounts this week has gained over 17,000 thousand signature since going online April 5.The petition requests that the Indian government support the Blockchain and crypto sphere, specifically because it provides young people with jobs:“There are tens of thousands of youth that have gotten jobs or employment with blockchain and relating companies. This is massive for a government which has not been able to improve the employment rate.”According to the petition, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) April 5 ban – which tech investor Tim Draper had recently called “a huge mistake” – could lead to an increase of irregular cash trading of cryptocurrencies in India. In addition, the ban could take away potential revenue to the government from crypto exchanges, and instigate a crypto market price drop “due to the knee jerk reaction in which prices got impacted”.The petition notes the inevitability of Blockchain development globally and calls on the Indian government to remain competitive with other countries on the issue so as to not be “left behind”:“Crypto and blockchain as a concept can't be stopped. You can just decide whether you want to participate with full throttle or get left behind. The current stance from government shows they would want to remain left behind after missing the internet revolution first, AI revolution next and now blockchain revolution.”In addition to the petition, resistance to the ban was also seen from individuals inside the community. Ajeet Khurana, CEO of Indian crypto exchange Zebpay, tweeted boldly on April 5 “no way I am stopping.”No way I am stopping. We will continue to do what is best for our customers, and what is best for our country. Am studying the present situation and will react shortly. and we will emerge stronger.CEO of Indian crypto exchange WazirX, Nischal Shetty, tweeted directly to RBI, asking them to “reconsider” and “think progressively”.US, Japan, South Korea go towards regulating Cryptos so that their country progresses while RBI decides to block Indians from getting involved in the crypto revolution. We need to think progressively, @RBI please reconsider this and let's take a positive step forward ??The petition also mentions RBI’s interest in creating their own digital currency, which was officially expressed the same day as the ban, April 5.  The petition states the seeming irony that “RBI here wants to stop others and at the same time explore blockchain tech themselves.”RBI’s crypto ban is not the same as the country-wide crypto ban that was rumoured earlier this year. Cointelegraph contributor Joseph Young posted on Twitter that Indian crypto exchange Unocoin noted that as of April 6, “no banks have terminated relationships with local trading platforms”:Unocoin, one of India's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, stated that no banks have terminated relationships with local trading platforms, and that the Indian central bank's recent statement does not change the legal status of cryptocurrencies in India.https://t.co/POYv89qChB pic.twitter.com/xo7yGCNAT6",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #India    #Central Bank  
Texas Orders Allegedly Fraudulent Crypto Investment Program To Cease And Desist,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/7/2018 11:29,22685,210,"The Texas State Securities Board has sent an Emergency Cease and Desist letter on April 5 to Mark J. Moncher, the Millionaire Mentor University, and several other connected players to stop selling unlicensed securities and defrauding investors in an allegedly fraudulent complex cryptocurrency trading and medical marijuana investment scheme.Two of the other respondents named in the letter, Estrada Trucking and Capital Cash, as well as Moncher, are accused of offering promissory notes that are considered unlicensed securities for a California-licensed, unnamed marijuana growing operation. Moncher and the Millionaire Mentor University, or the Freedom Financial Club, have also been accused of purposefully suggesting that Texas residents defraud credit card companies.Investments in the cryptocurrency trading program associated with Moncher apparently offered an 8 percent weekly returns on investments, with an investment minimum of $2000 and sign up fee of $150 that both had to be paid by either credit or debit card.The crypto trading program would provide investors with an invoice stating that they bought a “gold Seiko watch which [they] will never get,” as “protection in the event somebody runs away.” In the case of a bad investments, investors were suggested to report to their credit or debit card company that the watch never arrived and receive their money back.The cease and desist order notes that the respondents involved the crypto trading program purposely attempted to hide the cryptocurrency aspect of the investment, citing them as saying, “We really don’t want to portray this as an investment in crypto because then you’re opening yourself up to a can of worms.”The respondents also failed to disclose that Moncher is a convicted felon who served 57 months for conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, as well as not disclosing the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, like market volatility and potential for hacking.Texas has had a run of cease and desist letters to crypto-related businesses since the beginning of this year, with alleged Ponzi scheme Bitconnect ordered to stop selling “unlicensed securities” in Texas in early January and asking an allegedly “scam” related cryptocurrency bank to leave the state. More recently in mid-February, Texas regulators sent a cease and desist letter to Leadinvest.com, citing the selling of unlicensed securities and overall “[threatening] immediate and irreparable harm.”Moncher’s Millionaire Mentor University website is still active by press time.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Texas    #Investments    #Cryptocurrencies  
"Tim Draper Calls India’s Crypto Stance A “Huge Mistake,” Warns Of Potential Brain Drain",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/7/2018 10:35,32792,540,"Tech investor Tim Draper, whose recent re-entry to India’s market was prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise to crackdown on corruption, nevertheless criticized India’s negative stance on cryptocurrencies during an interview with The Economic Times published yesterday, April 6.Draper had returned to the Indian market in February 2017 - having exited it in 2016 due to a perceived lack of “rule of law” prompting Draper Fisher Jurvetson to sell their entire Indian portfolio - when the Mumbai-based startup backer Blume Ventures joined the Draper Venture Network.India’s central bank had announced on April 5 that they would no longer deal with crypto-related accounts - not the direct government ban on crypto which had been falsely rumoured in early February. India’s Ministry of Finance had also criticized cryptocurrency as a “Ponzi scheme” without “intrinsic value” at the beginning of January.Despite his positive outlook on Modi’s ability to stamp out corruption, Draper calls the Indian government’s denial of cryptocurrency as valid tender as “the stupidest thing,” also referencing China’s similar stance:“If I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake.”Draper notes that “Bitcoin and [B]lockchain are the best things to have happened for business,” adding that “countries such as India, where billions of rupees are wasted on inefficiencies and needless paperwork, will benefit most from the ease and security of blockchain.” If India makes cryptocurrency illegal, then, according to Draper, “other countries will raise their hands to get all the [Indian Blockchain] entrepreneurs:”“If the local authorities are banning crypto, then companies in the space should move elsewhere. The government needs to realize that it is stifling innovation and should instead be creating an environment where these ideas can be tested and promoted. They have the choice to be trendsetters and attract the world’s best engineers and coders, or lose their best and brightest to other regions.”Draper, who is a Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast, said during the interview that Bitcoin “should be the national currency” of India, for Draper believes that its “global” nature and ability to store value will make it “acceptable everywhere for transactions” in a few years.Draper also spoke about the potential for Blockchain to “roc[k] the venture capital business,” creating a competitive virtual environment where only the “flexible and reinvent[ive]” will be successful:“Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.”In regards to investments in future Indian Blockchain and crypto startups, Draper mentioned that Blume Ventures and Boost VC had co-invested in Unocoin, and that he will “continue to seek other opportunities.”One of Unocoin’s co-founders, Sathvik Vishwanath, had said earlier this week that the central bank has not taken the “right direction” in regards to cryptocurrencies, citing that the bank’s ban will “cause panic among a few million people in India who are already using [cryptocurrencies.]”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Tim Draper    #India    #Cryptocurrencies    #Unocoin  
Russia Blocks Crypto Exchange Debut Ahead Of Anti ‘Gold Rush’ Regulations,William Suberg,9/11/2017 13:41,17533,228,"Russia has promised cryptocurrency regulation laws will be ready by the end of the year as the central bank head calls it a “gold rush.”Speaking at the Moscow Financial Forum, Elvira Nabiullina told reporters that so-called “money surrogates” would not feature on Russian exchanges.“The use of cryptocurrencies as money surrogates is actively presenting itself for payments of goods and services,” she said quoted by TASS.“In our view, this is tantamount to risking disruption to money circulation, and of course we are not going to allow the use of cryptocurrencies as money surrogates.”Nabiullina’s comments run in contrast to statements last month from deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev, who said plans were afoot to only allow “authorized investors” access to cryptocurrency, specifically through the Moscow Stock Exchange.Russia has long used the term ‘money surrogates’ to refer to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies and continues to present conflicting approaches on how it will regulate or otherwise control their domestic use.Following Nabiullina, finance minister Anton Siluanov told TV channel Rossiya 1 in an interview that regulation was “essential” for “deceptive investors” earning and profiting from this “highly volatile finance instrument.”“The ministry will prepare the package of laws by the end of the year,” he confirmed.Vladislav Obushinsky, Project Manager at Institute of Internet Development, Russian Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association (RABIK), believes that this year the constant regulation option won’t be accepted as there will be an intermediate version of a future law.He tells Cointelegraph:“By expressing interests of crypto-industry, namely crypto investors and the cryptocurrency owners, RABIK lobbies for a liberal scenario of cryptocurrency regulation, meaning more flexibility in spread and management of latter. That is why making a law in a hurry, not taking into account those who will be affected by it, is, for sure, headlong.”",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Alexey Moiseev  
Great Time to Buy Bitcoin as “Unreliable Sources” from China Spook Markets,Nick Ayton,9/10/2017 16:16,74428,1747,"As usual there is a massive overreaction from news coming from China. It’s possible to say that the basis of latest announcement that China is banning ICOs and exchanges is unreliable as there has been no formal statement from a government official.The origin of the news was a Google translated article from a Chinese journalist, who apparently had spoken to some official. So the news is three layers from the original source.Last time China banned or wanted to stop Bitcoin, they reversed the situation some months after.Remember, China have many laws preventing capital flight, money leaving China, and we are not used to laws being verbal unsubstantiated statements, from non-government officials.Are some people having an agenda to pump Bitcoin and spook the market? This news may actually be doing everyone a favour, as it is likely to be the last time you can buy Bitcoin at these levels. We have just had it gifted to us, a 30 percent return as BTC will dipped below $4000 and then returned to business as usual.Bitcoin isn’t the issue here. It’s Ether, which is largely the hub of the ICO community, that is likely to take a pounding, with the Ethereum network struggling to keep pace with demand. ICOs are, after all, the pump for Ether, and it is likely that ETH will continue to rise for the time being.Many ICOs are founded on poor ideas, and big ones could expose the market when founders fail to deliver what was promised, because they lack experience and have never run a business.Many ERC20 token launches in the past six months are based on bad ideas and flawed thinking where tokenomics don't work for investors.First ICOs get called out, run out of money, and many have delivered nothing to users or investors. But for the time being, ICOs will pump ETH and in 2018 we will see 5000 ICOs.Remember, Chinese investors are still out there, still buying into ICOs, and above all China is not the market, it is not Bitcoin, and the world of crypto will push on with or without them.China has and will reverse the decision, they are pumping mining pools like everyone else, Russia, America, India and the enterprise takeover continues…China banned Bitcoin, then changed its mind. China’s rules to prevent capital flight isn’t working. China cannot pick and choose the things it likes from capitalism, it’s capitalism that is paying to build China into what it is today.",14,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Banned Bitcoin  
"Russia is Working on Legalizing Status of Bitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies: RT",Joshua Althauser,9/10/2017 15:50,50590,1524,"Russia is in the midst of legitimizing cryptocurrencies. It is developing a legal framework that will govern transactions using digital currencies like Bitcoin, RT reports.Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov conveyed this at a recent financial forum in Moscow. He assured Russian users of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that the government will not outlaw nor penalize people who use cryptocurrencies.It is a complete turnaround from the Russian Ministry’s stance last year, emerging after President Vladimir Putin signified approval for digital currencies.Putin had met with Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin, who ingrained the merits of Russia’s usage of the Blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin. Thereafter, a consortium of lenders have mulled over the possibility of using the technology to cut costs. Meantime, a presidential aide had announced plans for an initial coin offering (ICO).The Russian Finance Ministry had previously balked on and considered prohibition of the use of cryptocurrencies in apartments which it deemed unsafe. Now that it has gotten backing from Putin, and the state has realized that digital currencies are part of the new economic realities, Siluanov said there is no point in outlawing them. He said the next move is to draw up a bill before yearend to regulate cryptocurrencies.Siluanov has yet to disclose further details, but merely said that the Russian Ministry’s goal is to make the purchase of cryptocurrencies covered by law to in the same manner as buying treasury bonds and other securities.As with other technology trends, digital currencies have not won over everyone. In Russia, there are still non-believers. Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina, for instance, referred to the global commotion over digital currencies as a “gold fever” sweeping nations, and expressed misgivings over their use as a surrogate for money.In other news, China has not been as receptive to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies. In fact, its financial regulator plans to shut off major Bitcoin exchanges has led to Bitcoin’s price plummeting.  There has also been much speculation over cracking down on cryptocurrencies, following a recent decision by The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to outlaw fundraising through ICOs, which have surged in popularity.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Putin    #PBOC    #Bank of Russia  
"China Ban on ICO is Temporary, Licensing to be Introduced: Official",Joseph Young,9/10/2017 15:30,84766,2758,"During an interview with state-owned national television network CCTV-13, Hu Bing, a researcher at the Institute of Finance and Banking, a Chinese government-supported academic research organization, claimed that the government’s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) is only temporary.The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and its Institute of Finance and Banking are affiliated with the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the chief administrative authority of the People’s Republic of China. The Chinese Institute of Finance and its researchers are considered to be a government institution and government officials.In his interview with CCTV translated by Box Mining, Bing explained that the suspension on ICOs and the government’s declaration of ICOs as an illegal fundraising method are only temporary, until local financial regulators introduce necessary regulatory frameworks and policies for both ICO investors and projects.More importantly, Bing emphasized that the Chinese cryptocurrency community must understand that the government has not “forbidden” ICOs but instead “paused” them, demonstrating the government’s intention to resume ICOs in the near future. Bing also noted that the Chinese government and its financial regulators are currently considering the potential of allowing ICOs to raise money in a controlled environment, through a licensing program.Essentially, if the government decides to legalize and regulate the ICO market, its licensing program would structure similarly to the BitLicense program of New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDF), which requires companies to obtain a license from the state in order to operate and serve people of New York.Many startups in New York have left the state due to the impractical policies proposed by NYSDF and the BitLicense. Specifically, even large-scale startups like ShapeShift, which remain as one of the most widely utilized cryptocurrency exchanges, have left New York because of the state’s strict policies in regard to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.But, five companies including Coinbase and Bitstamp have maintained their operations in the state of New York, spending upwards to $100,000 in order to obtain their license.In the upcoming months, it’s possible for the Chinese government to roll out a licensing program for ICOs, as an attempt to restructure the market and introduce legitimate ICO projects and Blockchain startups to the public for token sales and fundraising.It is important to consider that the Chinese government has a history of banning many emerging and innovative technologies. For instance, in 2013, the Chinese government and its financial regulators had banned Bitcoin on two separate occasions. PBoC went as far to ban Bitcoin transactions and trading activities. But, as trading activities simply moved over to over-the-counter markets and the market became even more difficult to regulate, PBoC and Chinese financial regulators came to a consensus to legalize and regulate Bitcoin.A similar situation may transpire with the ICO market. If ICOs and Blockchain startups simply move to Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, countries that have expressed their optimism towards ICOs, the ban on ICOs by the Chinese government will only hurt the Chinese Blockchain sector.",14,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Banned Bitcoin    #Bitcoin Mining    #USA    #Singapore

Bitcoin Congressman Polis Legislation Abolishes Tax For US Crypto Payments Below $600,William Suberg,9/8/2017 9:35,17787,377,"Bitcoin-friendly congressman Jared Polis has introduced legislation that could allow US citizens to pay in cryptocurrency without reporting it for tax.The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act, a bipartisan effort with Republican David Schweikert, aims to give everyone a $600 leeway to use crypto without needing to submit a tax return to the IRS later.Bitcoin and virtual currencies are still classed as property in the US, obligating users to report any form of gains or losses on holdings each tax year, regardless of amount.The issue is especially poignant in 2017, as the US’s largest exchange Coinbase battles the IRS in what consumers and politicians alike have criticized as an “overly broad” tax investigation.“To keep up with modern technology, we need to remove outdated restrictions on cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and other methods of digital payment,” Polis said in a press release Thursday.  “By cutting red tape and eliminating onerous reporting requirements, it will allow cryptocurrencies to further benefit consumers and help create good jobs.”Washington is currently home to the Blockchain Caucus, a joint initiative begun in February by Polis aiming to increase education and awareness of virtual currency among the echelons of US politics.Commenting on the new act, Coin Center CEO Jerry Brito, who worked with Polis on the Caucus, said it would create a “level playing field.”“We applaud Representatives Polis and Schweikert for their leadership in introducing the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act, which would treat cryptocurrencies similarly to how foreign currency is now treated and relieve users from having to keep track of small personal transactions,” he said.“Not only will this create a level playing field for digital currencies, it will also help unleash innovation on applications like micropayments, which can consist of dozens of transactions per minute and thus are difficult to square with the current law.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Payments    #Taxes    #Coinbase    #IRS    #Coin Center

The bill does stipulate that a series of similar transactions will be considered one transaction, but no guidance is given on the level of similarity. The bill states:“For purposes of this subsection, all sales or exchanges which are part of the same transaction (or a series of related transactions) shall be treated as one sale or exchange.”The bill comes at a time when there is widespread concern among cryptocurrency holders about federal tax policies.

Binance Addresses Concerns Over China’s ICO Ban,Joshua Althauser,9/6/2017 23:20,17195,142,"Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently released a statement regarding the  Chinese government’s prohibition of ICOs in the country.Binance said they are working round to clock to find solutions and address the problem.“Regarding the recent announcement from China's PBoC banning all ICOs, we are working around the clock on a solution that will fully satisfy the new regulations in China, while preserving and enhancing features that are valuable to our western community”.Binance’s statement comes on the heels of the recent decision by the Chinese government to ban all Initial Coin Offerings in the country. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) released the report finding Initial Coin Offerings illegal Monday.According to their findings, the tokens or cryptocurrency used in ICOs are not issued by the monetary authorities thus don’t have legal or monetary properties and cannot be used and circulated as a currency in the market.Chinese regulators are also forcing those who have already raised money to return the funds back to their investors.Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was quick to announce that only 18% of its customers are likely to be affected as customers from other countries are growing:Only 18% of @binance_2017 users are from China, Other markets are gaining fast. pic.twitter.com/mF3DGMKWu6Here’s the complete statement from Binance:?Binance Update 2017/09/06?https://t.co/9Ni2ByWdL5Their site is currently in undergoing scheduled system update as of press time.Hi, we have a system upgrade from 2017/09/07 00:00 (Beijing Time).

"While China is Getting Tough With ICOs, Canada Voices Support For Token Sale",Joshua Althauser,9/6/2017 17:50,13908,859,"Financial regulators in Canada are giving the digital currencies and initial coin offering (ICO) activities a big break. Among the regulators is Quebec’s Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), which intends to give the Blockchain use case a chance, if not altogether encourage it.To show its support to ICOs, the AMF has determined that the token sale conducted by socially responsible enterprises investment startup Impak Finance is a security. The regulator also accepted the company into its regulatory sandbox.The AMF has also relieved Impak Finance some of the requirements that it usually required from securities for protection purposes so that the ICO will materialize.According to AMF corporate finance division director Patrick Theoret, the move is a test case to determine whether there will be investor protection issues that will emerge from the ICO: ""It’s in the spirit of the sandbox that we are willing to alleviate some of the requirements on, sort of, a test case basis. It's a test run to see whether there are investor protection [issues] with the relief that we grant."" In its bid to support fintech projects in Canada, the consortium of provincial securities regulators called the Canadian Securities Administration to launch the regulatory sandbox so that the projects that are not covered by a legacy framework can materialize.An ICO, which is an emerging fundraising mechanism by which new virtual currencies are created and sold to investors, fits in the regulatory sandbox.According to Impak Finance president Paul Allard, they decided to participate in the sandbox due to their belief that the regulators are really interested in supporting the digital currency sector: ""I had been working with the regulators for several years prior to Impak Coin, and I knew that they were keen in adapting their regulatory framework to catch up with the cryptocurrency sector.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Tokens    #Canada    #Digital Currency    #Government

Russia has its own cryptography school,” he commented quoted by Sputnik News.“I think that we are absolutely capable of creating a cryptographic unit, a tool, based on the Blockchain technology, and work out concrete regulations to set the framework for the operations.”Nikiforov adds to the increasingly confusing Russian governmental stance of cryptocurrency, which is facing a mixture of support and ban threats from bureaucrats.Deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev announced in a TV interview last week that cryptocurrencies should only be available to “authorized investors” via the Moscow Stock Exchange and not to “ordinary people.” He added that it was “hard to argue against” cryptocurrency being a “pyramid scheme.”At the same time, a work group is due to recommend a ban on private persons undertaking Bitcoin mining at home due to what a spokesman described as safety concerns.Meanwhile, a concerted state-sponsored effort to take mining prowess away from China is underway, with plans to raise up to $100 mln in support.Nikiforov added that suggested regulations for cryptocurrency would be “filed to the government” as they were already prepared.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Bitcoin Foundation    #Interview

Many ICOs canceled, while some continued unfazed.The announcement cited sources close to financial decision makers within the government who indicated that the ban was just the tip of the proverbial iceberg regarding regulations on cryptocurrencies and their spin-offs.The cryptocurrency markets responded to the news rapidly, with huge sell-offs in Ethereum (down 15 percent on the week) and other coins linked to ICOs. Chinese cryptos also lost value, with NEO dropping as much as 30 percent on huge volumes.Other countries have also promised increased regulation.

China Forces ICOs To Return Funds As Korea Warns Of ‘Punishments’,William Suberg,9/5/2017 9:15,16128,290,"The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has confirmed the country’s ICO ban, saying the financial tool was now “illegal” while “monitoring” continues.An official message from the bank’s website Monday announced that “all ICO activities shall cease immediately.”“Organizations and persons already having completed ICO campaigns should return funds to investors to protect their legal rights and interests, as well as to avert any risk,” it continued.The retroactive nature of the PBoC ban goes one step beyond a similar ban on cryptocurrency trading earlier this year when the regulator enforced a shutdown of legal exchanges which lasted several months.These are now also prohibited from interacting with ICOs or their tokens, the PBoC states, and ICO operators themselves are required to stop converting funds to fiat.“Platforms may neither buy nor sell digital tokens or offer intermediary services relating to prices or other information,” the notice outlines.“Regarding illegal ICO platforms, financial authorities should demand telecoms operators stop servicing associated websites and mobile apps, and also delete these apps from the relevant marketplaces. Authorities should also cancel business licenses in accordance with current laws.”China is responsible for around 40 percent of the ICO industry’s total $1 bln plus revenues, sources have suggested.The phenomenon had enjoyed an almost unhindered rise, which saw almost anyone able to gather investments through the issuance of digital tokens.Only in the past several months have regulatory bodies internationally caught up, with the US now also signaling a more formal approach, along with certain other jurisdictions.In freezing out ICOs and cutting off options for conducting business with relevant third parties, Chinese regulators are exposing a maximal section of the business community to the threat of legal repercussions.More crucially, these appear to involve broader - yet unspecified - business with “digital currency” in general.“Financial and non-banking payments organizations are not to either directly or indirectly offer any form of goods or services - including launch, registration, clearing or settlements - linked to ICOs or digital currencies,” the PBoC warns.“They may also not finance businesses linked to ICOs or digital currencies. If a financial company or non-banking payments organization comes across anything linked with the ICO sector, they should inform the relevant authorities.”The news from China comes alongside similar announcements from South Korea, where ICOs are now in line for “punishment” according to the country’s Financial Services Commission.“We will clearly state the foundations of the Act on the Regulation of Conducting Fund-Raising Business Without Permission for illegal fund-raising impersonating digital currency investment and strengthen levels of punishment,” local news outlet BusinessKorea quotes a Commission official.  “We will expand the application range of Act on the Regulation of Conducting Fund-Raising Business Without Permission and come up with regulations on digital currency trading by establishing the law.”",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #South Korea    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China

Regulators also said that those who have already raised money must issue refunds back to their investors.Jehan Chu, Managing Partner at Kenetic Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong says:“China, due to its size and as one of the most speculative IPO markets, needed to take a firmer action so this is somewhat in step with, maybe not to the same extent, what we’re starting to see in other jurisdictions -- the short story is we all know regulations are coming.”",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #China    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China    #Hong Kong

Other concerns were also discussed, such as the character of virtual currency traders, taxation and permits.Meanwhile, South Korean lawmakers are already advancing a set of bills to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.

Australia's Securities Regulator Issues Formal Guidance on ICOs,Lisa Froelings,10/1/2017 13:45,16131,369,"A regulatory guidance for businesses has been issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) marking the launching of initial coin offering (ICO).The legal treatment for the usage of ICOs will depend on the natural structure of the cryptographic tokens, according to a document on the regulator's website.More so, the token sales will be categorized under general Australian consumer law given that the ICO structured company is not offering financial products as this will be regulated under the country's Corporations Act.Part of the ASIC statement reads:""In some cases, ICO issuers may frame the entitlements received by contributors as a receipt of a purchased service. However, if the value of the digital coins acquired is affected by the pooling of funds from contributors or use of those funds under the arrangement, then the ICO is likely to fall within the requirements relating to MIS managed investment schemes. This is often the case if what is offered through the ICO has the attributes of an investment.”The law issued by the ASIC will carry some protections for investors, but if an ICO fails to meet the required definitions, that may not be the case.There are other regulations and guidelines the ICOs need to follow depending on its structure as noted earlier. One of the regulations include if an ICO is considered an MIS, there is a ""range of disclosure, registration and licensing obligations under the Corporations Act,"" the document says.ASIC commissioner John Price told the Sydney Morning Herald that, if the tokens are not financial products,“investors will need to closely consider the ICO documentation as the investor protection regime under the Corporations Act will not apply.""Furthermore, for ICO financial products, the operator may also require a market license in order to sell tokens. The ASIC statement gives a warning to the ICO white papers to not issue misleading or unclear statements to the consumers as this is prohibited by the law.Approximately $797 mln was raised by ICOs in the second quarter of this year, according to Mashable.Australia has recently moved towards legalizing Bitcoin as well as ending double taxation to cryptocurrencies.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Australia    #ASIC    #Tokens    #Cryptocurrencies

She further claimed that the digital currencies could provide conventional government-issued tenders a “run for their money.”At a conference held in London, England, Lagarde said that different countries, particularly those with “weak institutions and unstable national currencies” may directly adopt a cryptocurrency.""Instead of adopting the currency of another country – such as the US dollar – some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0. So in many ways, virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money. The best response by central bankers is to continue running effective monetary policy while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.""Lagarde cited several factors that may drive the adoption of virtual currencies. Among them is the possible shift in consumer preference for new currencies which are “easier and safer” than traditional ones.These will be further improved if the digital currencies become more stable.Lagarde, however, clarified that the takeover of cryptocurrencies over conventional ones is still a distant prospect.This is because virtual currencies are still “too volatile, too risky, too energy intensive and because the underlying technologies are not yet scalable.”Meanwhile, the IMF continued to promote a balanced approach to digital currency regulation.In its early 2016 staff paper, IMF considers distributed ledgers to have the capability to revolutionize the financial sector through cost reduction and deeper financial inclusion in the long term.Lagarde also cited its support for the financial applications of Blockchain technology.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Christine Lagarde    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #IMF    #London

China’s Traders Become Mainstream Heroes By Defying Exchange Ban,William Suberg,9/29/2017 16:05,23143,268,"Chinese investors are defying the ICO and exchange ban to such an extent that their rebellion has even made mainstream news.Citing traders and commentators in mainland China and over the border, Reuters notes that despite “sensitivities” on the topic, cryptocurrency holders are seeking any reasonable method to continue trading.“They can’t set rules to stop me from investing in what I want to invest in,” an anonymous Chinese user told the publication Friday.“They say you are protecting me, but as long as I think this is good, they have no way to intervene.”China’s original ban on ICOs and impending ban on crypto-to-fiat trading seriously dampened market appetite for expansion earlier this month. A rebound has been slow to materialize, with each announcement from the country’s authorities serving to quash growth once again.As the renminbi dropped almost two percent this week - the most since its 2015 devaluation - suspicions are mounting the Bitcoin ban was too well timed.As with China’s previous exchange ban in February, however, traders appear broadly unfazed.“I can do over-the-counter trades or I’ll go offshore...My wallet is my wallet. I’ve never registered my identification card,” the anonymous investor continued.China’s LocalBitcoins market posted its highest-ever weekly volumes of 115.1 mln yuan for the seven days to Sep. 23.A shift in focus to offshore meanwhile is something not just users, but industry insiders foresee as increasingly common once the full exchange ban in place by the end of October.Investment guide author Zeng Danhua told local news outlet Yicai this week:“The trend of digital currency transactions moving offshore is inevitable. The regulators may have needed to shut the platforms to guard against financial risks, and there may be a Bitcoin bubble, but its investment value persists.”",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #ICO    #Reuters  
Russia May Ban Bitcoin Payments Entirely: Deputy Finance Minister,Jon Buck,9/29/2017 10:15,19441,363,"Russia seems to be constantly shifting its stance on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Just a month ago, Buterin was smiling and signing agreements with the Russian state banks for Ethereum partnerships. Now suddenly, it appears that Russia may ban Bitcoin payments entirely, as was previously suggested.The Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev told reporters that the cryptocurrency would likely be banned, especially given its volatile history, risk to consumers and potential for hacking loss. In an interview he said:""No regulator doubts that payments will be banned. In my opinion, in a country where millions have suffered from pyramid schemes, it is impossible to allow the situation when citizens sell apartments in order to make investments in cryptocurrencies to repeat.”In spite of the strong statements by the Deputy Finance Minister, other members of the Duma have taken a softer stance.In a separate interview, Anatoly Aksakov, head of the State Duma for the Financial Market Committee, made it clear that no comprehensive plan had come to fruition. He told reporters:""The discussions will continue. In any case, there is a market. It is developing rapidly, and there are certain advantages that could be used. I mean the advantages associated with attracting investments for projects through the ICO. I have a positive attitude to this, but there is another point of view. In order to make a decision, consensus will be necessary.”Whether the more straightforward Moiseev or, the more political Aksakov will win out remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the battle for how to deal with cryptocurrencies in Russia will continue. Russia may become a test case for whether it is even possible for a government to ban Bitcoin at all.",14,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Payments    #Finance    #Alexey Moiseev    #ICO

CEO Patrick Byrne told CNBC:“We can start moving these ICOs in and provide good, regulated trading.”Crackdowns on digital token trading from China and warnings from other major jurisdictions have served to dampen the previously vast enthusiasm for ICOs which saw a $2 bln industry appear in a matter of months.While their prognosis in the US remains uncertain, Overstock’s first mover advantage in bringing in regulatory participation for its offering is clear.“Overstock has been very methodical on getting the necessary regulators on board,"" DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte continued to CNBC.

Showtime - Latest Secret Crypto Pirate Miner,Darryn Pollock,9/27/2017 18:55,18188,258,"After it was discovered that illegal downloads site, The Pirate Bay, was secretly utilizing its visitor’s processing power to mine Monero, Showtime’s website has been found to be doing the same.It was understood that because of the illegal nature of The Pirate Bay’s content, it was in search of an alternative revenue stream aside from advertising. However, with regards to Showtime, their website is legal and available for advertising, but this is still believed to be another attempt at revenue boosting.The script that was found on the two affected sites for Showtime -  showtime.com and showtimeanytime.com - is known as Coinhive. According to the site, it was made as an alternative to banner ads as a way for website owners to get around pesky ad-blockers. Ironically, some ad-blockers have now included Coinhive on the list of the banned.This script is able to mine Monero, a cryptocurrency that is similar to Bitcoin but much more anonymous. The idea behind this script is that it can be used as an alternative to advertising, however, when it has been discovered recently, it has been implemented secretly.Coinhive takes in 30 percent of the proceeds from sites that use their service while the remainder is sent to the site that is utilizing the script.When The Pirate Bay was caught in the act of using similar scripts they were apologetic about the secret running of something that utilizes their users’ processing power without permission. However, in a follow-up, The Pirate Bay posted the question if users would prefer advertising or crypto mining, and the responses were predominantly positive towards mining.Coinhive updated its site to include the statement: “We're a bit saddened to see that some of our customers integrate Coinhive into their pages without disclosing to their users what's going on, let alone asking for their permission.” Going forward, the service claims that it will now ask people browsing a site for permission before mining their CPU.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Monero    #Pirate Bay    #Mining    #JavaScript  
"While China Bans Bitcoin Exchanges, Japanese Government Embraces Them",Joseph Young,9/27/2017 17:50,16330,578,"Beginning October, Japanese Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges will be fully surveilled and investigated by local authorities as a part of a larger initiative to create a more regulated and robust Japanese Bitcoin exchange market.Earlier this month, the Chinese government enforced a nationwide ban on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges, forcing large-scale cryptocurrency trading platforms including BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi to shut down their services. With the imposition of such an impractical and unnecessarily inefficient ban on exchanges, China further isolated itself from the global Bitcoin industry and market.Consequently, the majority of traders, entrepreneurs and trading volumes in China have left to neighboring markets. Overnight, after the finalization of the ban and the closure of leading Bitcoin exchanges, the trading volumes of Japan and South Korea surged, as Japan overtook the US to evolve into the largest Bitcoin exchange market in the world. According to various Bitcoin market data providers including CryptoCompare, Japan remains the largest Bitcoin exchange market with 44 percent of the market share.Unlike China, Japan is taking a more responsible approach towards regulating Bitcoin exchanges. Instead of enforcing a nationwide ban on trading platforms, the government intends to surveil and investigate into Bitcoin exchanges for a brief period of time in October. With the information it gathers from its investigation, the Japanese government will release a licensing program to regulate its local Bitcoin exchange market efficiently.In an interview, an unnamed FSA official told The Japan Times that the focus of the Japanese government is set on fostering its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, not to prevent growth and stall their progress. The FSA official stated, ""We pursue both market fostering and regulation enforcement.”In the upcoming weeks, leading Japanese Bitcoin exchanges including bitFlyer, Japan’s largest Bitcoin exchange by trading volume and other trading platforms such as multi-billion dollar technology conglomerate GMO Group’s Bitcoin exchange ZCoin, would likely be requested to submit daily reports and comply with the investigation of the Japanese government. Upon the completion of the investigation, the Japanese government will launch a licensing program to enhance existing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems.The Japanese government’s surveillance and investigation into its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange markets could be considered as a positive indicator of growth.Earlier this week, Mario Draghi, the President of the ECB, which administers the monetary policy of the 19-countries eurozone, explained that Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer protocol that cannot be prohibited or regulated. But, Draghi also told that it is not in the interest of the ECB to provide regulatory frameworks around Bitcoin trading activities because the market is still premature.The Japanese government's interest in providing a licensing program for Bitcoin exchanges and fostering its market demonstrates that the crypto exchange markets, both regional and global, are not premature and developing to be larger at an exponential rate.",11,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Banned Bitcoin    #Investments    #Japan  
What Happens to Bitcoin When I Die?,Darryn Pollock,9/27/2017 16:32,20320,594,"Unlike retirement funds or even savings accounts, no one needs to know that you own them, or how much you have in them or indeed how to access them without you. Bitcoin provides a safeguarded space for the store of wealth that can be kept secret from everyone.It is one of the attractive features of Bitcoin for some, but it also means that it is all too easy to take a fortune of digital currency to the grave.There have been some recent examples of people dying without making provisions for their Bitcoin fortune, which can lead to some sticky situations for the next of kin to try and claim it.In a recent case, a man in Colorado passed away leaving more of a burden and debt for his family to sort out than an inheritance - or so they thought.Turns out, the man had been investing in Bitcoin back when it was nearer to $13 a coin, rather than the $4,000 it finds itself at today. His Bitcoin fortune was stored in a virtual wallet, which provided its own problem.This man had been using Coinbase as a wallet which was one of the reasons that his family was able to claim his money.Upon reviewing his bank account, which revealed debits to Coinbase, his family with documents in hand approached the exchange, which confirmed the existence of a wallet and is now in the process of transferring its contents.Of course, this can lead to many issues with fraudsters using fake death certificates and other documents to make claims on certain customer’s Bitcoin wallets.Of course, this instance was reliant on Coinbase accepting his family’s story and opening his wallet for them, but there is another way to secure the future of your Bitcoin fortune for your next of kin.The private key of a wallet is the access pass for a wallet but is not always handed out by some of the more popular online wallets.If a Bitcoin owner dies without passing on the private key, his heirs may discover his wallet only to realize that they will never gain access to the wealth inside. To prevent this, the owner simply has to ensure that someone gets a copy of the private key by writing it down, storing it on a flash memory drive or entrusting it with a commercial service that manages them.There are of course instances, where Bitcoin can be lost forever, should a holder die and not make it know that he owns the digital currency. Because there is no forced taxation attached to Bitcoin, executors cannot even use that to locate assets.The Bitcoin situation can be likened to a time when people died with stock certificates in shoe boxes — sometimes they would go unnoticed for decades until the corporation that issued them concluded that nobody would redeem them and turned them over to a state government’s unclaimed property division.",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Wallet    #Coinbase  
European Central Bank President: No Power to Regulate Bitcoin,Jon Buck,9/26/2017 18:00,29482,737,"Mario Draghi, the erstwhile president of the European Central Bank (ECB) made some startling comments during his presentation today at the Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.When asked about cryptocurrency regulations or bans, similar to the political decisions the Chinese central government has enforced, Draghi made it clear that there is no way to ban Bitcoin, or to even regulate it, saying:“It would actually not be in our powers to prohibit and regulate them. We have to ask what effects cryptocurrencies have on the economy.”He added that they are still far too immature to be considered a viable payment methodology - a conclusion that was reached by the ECB in tandem with the Central Bank of Japan last week.While the ECB has no powers over the regulatory control of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they do have control over EU member states wishing to issue their own cryptocurrency, like Estonia.Draghi made it abundantly clear that the ECB does not recognize the ‘estcoin,’ stating that no member state can issue its own currency, even digitally. “The currency of the Eurozone is the euro,” he said succinctly.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ECB    #Estonia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Central Bank  
"Post-Hack, Coincheck Reveals Plans to Expand to U.S. Market",Marie Huillet,5/19/2018 0:30,12462,228,"Monex Inc, the company that recently acquired hacked Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck, has revealed plans to expand the exchange to the U.S. in an interview with Bloomberg today, May 18.Monex CEO Oki Matsumoto said he expects Coincheck will receive an official license from Japanese authorities next month, but - without specifying a timeframe - he revealed the company now has its sights beyond Asia:“Japan may seem like it’s one step ahead in crypto, but in terms of deciding what’s a security or a token and attracting institutional investors, the U.S. and Europe are moving ahead.”Japan has long been at the vanguard of crypto adoption - the country was the first to recognize Bitcoin as a form of legal tender back in 2016 - but Matsumoto considers that the U.S. and Europe have now taken the edge in terms of crypto-specific regulatory momentum. He compared Japan’s hefty 55 percent levy tax on crypto with France’s recent initiative to tax crypto at a favorable capital gains rate of 19 percent, telling Bloomberg that:“At [Japan’s] level, it’s hard to even think of crypto as something you’d put in your portfolio. That means it’ll just remain a plaything for speculators.”More crucially still, the CEO argued that U.S. federal regulators now wield the biggest influence on deciding the future status of crypto in the world economy, referring to the ongoing debate as to whether digital assets should be regulated as securities or commodities. An eventual decision would provide much-needed clarity for the emerging industry, and ultimately foster growth and institutional investor confidence, he told Bloomberg.Monex’s decision to target overseas markets is the latest in a series of upheavals in Coincheck’s checkered history since its unprecedented $532 mln hack in Jan. 2018. Coincheck was subsequently acquired by Monex in April, with the latter’s shares surging 98 percent since the acquisition, according to Bloomberg.Recent figures released by Monex showed that notwithstanding the mammoth post-hack writedown that Coincheck issued as a refund to affected customers, the exchange still closed the fiscal year in the green, netting ¥6.3 bln (about $56.7 mln) revenue on sales of ¥62.6 bln.Earlier this month, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), laid out yet further stipulations for the already stringent regulatory measures that have been imposed on the country’s crypto exchanges. An FSA source nonetheless judged that the crypto regulatory process in Japan has been unfolding ""without the necessary know-how - we been feeling our way through the dark.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Coincheck    #Japan    #Exchanges

Cases Of Illegal Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Mining: Chicken Farms And New York,Joseph Young,5/19/2018 10:50,18057,239,"In the US, China, and South Korea, many individual cryptocurrency miners and large-scale mining centers were cracked down for conducting illicit operations. For example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos.In South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives. The government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts.On April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city. An in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.By disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed.Image source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via HaniIn the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners. In the later months of their illegal venture, the group recruited more than 40 individuals and rented out their ASIC miners to produce even more cryptocurrencies.The group generated more than $300,000 by accepting ASIC miners from individuals within months but the actual sum of cryptocurrencies the group was able to produce throughout the 8-month period remains unclear.Preliminary investigations undertaken by the Gyeong-ki and Paju police has shown that the group produced at least 760 Ethereum, which is worth more than $500,000, and a large sum of Bitcoin. The local police is still investigating into the final sum of money the group generated throughout the past year. The police has also discovered that the group only paid 50 percent of the normal electricity rate and received significant discounts for renting out the farms and factories.Currently South Korea has no laws or policies approved that can punish cryptocurrency miners in development restricted areas. Minor charges could be applied to the five individuals, for using the space intended to carry out other initiatives, but no major penalties can be imposed as of now. To prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, the local police has requested the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs to draft and approve laws that prohibit cryptocurrency miners from taking advantage of districts and areas with cheaper electricity rates.In the US on March 18, local authorities in the state of New York requested a cryptocurrency mining facility to halt their mining initiative after residents of Plattsburg, a small lakeside town in upstate New York, filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.The city of Plattsburg did not impose a permanent ban on Bitcoin mining however. Instead, local authorities and residents released a moratorium which states that the city will not consider applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining for at least a year and a half. Bloomberg reported that the city can charge more than $1,000 per day if miners decide to use low-cost electricity of the city to mine. The authorities of Plattsburg said:“It is the purpose of this Local Law to facilitate the adoption of land use and zoning and/or municipal lighting department regulations to protect and enhance the City’s natural, historic, cultural and electrical resources.”Another cryptocurrency mining facility was confronted by local authorities and a telecommunication powerhouse T-Mobile on Feb. 15 after it was revealed that ASIC miners from a mining facility based in Brooklyn interfered with the 700 MHz band of T-Mobile. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said:“On November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau’s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile’s broadband network and causing harmful interference.”At the time, the FCC gave the mining facility a 20-day notice to halt their operations and move elsewhere as the radio emissions released by the ASIC miners within the facility were negatively impacting local telecommunication networks.Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is legal in most countries, even in China which banned the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in Sep. 2017.Cryptocurrency mining is legal in most regions because it is beneficial for electricity grid operators to provide excess energy that they can no longer supply to households and businesses. As such, although local governments have tried to ban cryptocurrency mining in the past as demonstrated in CNLedger’s report below, cryptocurrency mining remains unbanned in most countries.YiCai: Regulators are asking local departments to report the current status of bitcoin mining companies under administration, and ""guide the mining firms to exit in an orderly manner"" by taking various measures from the aspects of electricity, land, tax, environmental protectionIt is also not illegal to mine Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency using electricity that is low cost. However, it is illegal to disguise cryptocurrency mining initiatives as a protected business in a development restricted area to take advantage of cheap electricity that is only provided to approved organizations and institutions. This is why South Korean authorities are currently drafting regulations to prevent mining facilities from taking advantage of cities with cheaper electricity.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Mining    #South Korea    #USA

"Thailand Introduced Legal Framework, But Players Don’t Know How to Comply",Stephen O'Neal,5/20/2018 6:05,11406,259,"On Sunday, May 13, Thailand joined a pool of countries that have introduced regulatory frameworks regarding cryptocurrencies. The 100 section law, published in the country’s Royal Gazette, defines cryptocurrencies as digital assets and digital tokens that fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Thai Security Exchange Commission (TSEC), making it the main policeman of crypto transactions in the country.Thailand’s government has been discussing the idea of a regulatory framework since last February, when Veerathai Santiprabhob, governor of the Central Bank of Thailand asked all banks in the country to halt all cryptocurrency affairs before the corresponding laws are introduced.The chief concerns regarding crypto for the Thai government are typical for conservative politicians, although there has been a clear course towards regulations instead of a ban. Therefore in March, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam explained that the government needed to issue new laws to regulate cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) because they could be used in the context of “money laundering, tax avoidance and crime”.Finally, as reported by The Bangkok Post, Thai Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong echoed their statements as the law was finally introduced on May 13, saying that the new measures are not intended to prohibit cryptocurrencies or ICOs in the country.That position reiterates that of the TSEC, which has been broadly supportive of ICOs, as long as they are regulated. As local media outlet Matichon states, under the new law, the TSEC will become responsible for regulating digital asset businesses, setting the fees and requirements for the registration of cryptocurrencies, issuing guidelines regarding potential problems and dealing with other areas related to crypto that have not been specified in the document.The royal decree has already come into force. That means that sellers of digital assets or tokens must register with the TSEC within 90 days, before Aug.14. Those who fail to comply risk facing a penalty of up to twice the value of the unauthorized digital transaction, or at least 500,000 baht - about $15,700. The harshest punishment for unauthorized sellers is a jail sentence of up to two years.The Finance Ministry and the TSEC will now expand the framework - previously, it affected banks only - and require all local crypto exchanges, as well as independent crypto brokers and dealers, to register with relevant authorities.However, the situation remains unclear, as local companies and exchanges are only preparing to register with the SEC. The regulatory framework isn’t exactly ready, either — according to the Bangkok Post, within the next month, the Finance Ministry and the SEC will work on organic laws requiring all digital asset transactions to be registered with relevant agencies.J Ventures, a subsidiary of Jay Mart Plc which is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and the first company in Thailand to launch a successful ICO, will meet with the SEC on Friday, May 18 to discuss the new regulations. Reportedly, the company has reviewed the new law and highlighted “4-5 sections” to clarify with the agency, “such as filing the white paper and a section about insider trading, which is a criminal offence”, said J Ventures CEO Thanawat Lertwattanarak.""If digital coins are considered to be similar to stocks, I will not give any figure or say something that could be deemed insider trading,"" Lertwattanarak said, adding that he wants JFin coins to be classified as securities to qualify for tax-free status.Moreover, J Ventures will discuss the future of 100 mkn JFin tokens that have already been sold in the country’s first ICO, as well as the 200 mln tokens that could potentially be sold later. Lertwattanarak argues that while the state decided to regulate ICOs, there’s no specific agency that could navigate token issuers through new regulations:""If the government has the legal authority to curb digital [fundraising], they should have an organisation to help trading — whether the country has an official digital exchange with high standards like the SET or Market for Alternative Investment or not""As local media reported, the Bank of Thailand (BOT), the entity that previously prohibited other banks in the country from engaging in crypto activities, is also on the list of players awaiting more detailed regulations from the TSEC. Thus, the BOT reportedly says that it will wait for the TSEC to clarify its position on regulations before it will come up with its own stance on cryptocurrencies and ICOs.According to the new law, all crypto trades are subject to a 7 percent value added tax, as well as a 15 percent capital gains tax on returns.It seems that BX Thailand, the country’s largest crypto exchange, doesn’t quite understand how to comply with the new law either. In a comment for Asia Times, the exchange’s representatives said that while they are trying to inform their users about the capital gains tax, the taxation process still lacks clarity:“BX is relentlessly working to allocate all the information about tax capital gains 15 percent to our customers. But in the meantime, we’re still waiting for the Revenue Department and related departments to clarify the procedure of taxation. According to the Royal Act, customers need to collect and allocate their income and capital gain tax [and send this] to the Revenue Department … as currently BX is the one responsible for withholding the 15 percent tax.”Similarly, TDAX doesn’t plan to re-open its ICO Portal that was shut down in March amid the government’s comments regarding the introduction of a regulatory framework. The exchange awaits for additional details:“At the moment, they just announced the law without the clear way of how to do things yet. We need to wait for the SEC to announce more details.”On May 15, the general secretary of the TSEC confirmed that his agency will introduce additional laws in a comment for Matichon. He also stated that the law won’t cover investments in digital tokens made abroad. However, that, along with the aforementioned 15 percent withholding tax, might potentially provoke local traders to move to foreign exchanges and store their cryptocurrencies overseas, as co-founder of local Bitcoin wallet coins.co.th and blockchain enthusiast Jirayut Srupsrisopa told Bangkok Post.In April, before the taxes came into force, the TSEC and the Thai Fintech Association technology consultant Bhume Bhumiratana, along with members of the local crypto community, urged financial authorities to reconsider the country’s cryptocurrency tax framework, while the introduction of the digital asset tax provoked a strong negative reaction among local cryptocurrency business owners and enthusiasts.Namely, he stated that tax collection from ICO issued tokens should be considered differently from digital assets in general “because digital tokens differ in terms of asset value"".Another industry player, Thuntee Sukchotrat, CEO of the recently opened JIBEX cryptocurrency exchange, argued that the rights of investors should be approached with “financial and investment literacy” to allow local startups to raise funds from the Thai market. Otherwise, according to Sukchotrat, Thailand “will lose good ICO transactions to other markets.""",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Asia    #Thailand

Burt said that Bermuda “is able to accelerate economic growth, create jobs and attract global interest.” He stated:“The Government of Bermuda has decided to lead the way and build interoperability into the government legislation, in essence, approach regulatory frameworks with exportability in mind... We’re leading the world in digital assets regulation, there’s no other country that provides comparable certainty and [a] progressive regulatory environment.”The terms of the MOU state that the Toronto-based blockchain network will collaborate with the government in developing and improving “a robust legal and regulatory framework.” Shyft will also train Bermudians in blockchain technology and development through the country’s Department of Workforce Development.While MOUs are useful instruments for showing intent and building bilateral relationships between governments and businesses, they are not legally binding. One advantage of MOUs for some governments in that, since they do not carry legally enforceable conditions, they may be issued and adopted without legislative approval.In April, the Premier of Bermuda signed a MOU with Binance, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange by market capitalization, to receive funding for educational programs related to fintech and blockchain startups.

Russia’s Digital Economy Bill Supported by State Duma Committee in Move Towards Crypto Regulation,Molly Jane Zuckerman,5/17/2018 5:05,9662,187,"Russian State Duma’s Committee for Legislative Work will support the first reading of an initiative that will add the basic norms of digital economy to the Russian Federation Civil Code.  This is the latest step on the road to regulating cryptocurrency in the country, local news outlet Izvestia reports Wednesday, May 16.Pavel Krasheninnikov of political party United Russia and head of the Legislative Work committee, told Izvestia that the initiative aims to “minimize the existing risks of using digital objects for transferring assets into an unregulated digital environment for legalization of criminal incomes, bankruptcy fraud or for sponsoring terrorist groups.”The initiative, which is scheduled to be considered next week, does not mean that digital currencies will now become a legitimate means of payment. Instead, a separate law developed by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Economic Development will set conditions for digital currencies to be used as payment “in controlled quantities.” The initiative does assert that digital confirmation by a user in a smart contract is equal to his written consent.Russia first prepared a bill “On Digital Financial Assets” in March of this year, which would provide federal laws governing cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) inspired by President Vladimir Putin’s decision to begin crypto regulation on July 1.The March 20 draft defines crypto and digital tokens are assets only to be traded on authorized exchanges, also requiring user account at crypto exchanges to comply with AML and counter terrorism financing regulations. A review draft of the bill from mid-April added that the exchange of crypto for fiat above around $9,600 will be subject to mandatory currency exchange regulation.Igor Sudets, the director of the program “Blockchain for Lawyers” at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow, told Izvestia that “it is important that the crypto currency and tokens are included in the legal field of the Russian Federation”:“On the one hand, these are opportunities that we have no right to miss. On the other hand, while they are outside the legal field, they can be used to give bribes, withdraw money in the case of bankruptcy, pay ‘black salaries, and simply get stolen - with no repercussions [for criminals].”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Government    #Smart Contracts    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #AML    #Fiat Money

This is the outcome of many meetings and work of many people. There are many more nuances left to figure out. The final version will be ready in two weeks. I ask you to comment and edit. The thoughts of market practitioners are especially important.”The document notes that the legislation aims to create a “free and transparent” digital asset market in Ukraine, outlining rules for storing, using, and exchanging cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, and smart contracts at a state, entity, and individual level. It proposes regulatory measures for preventing the use of crypto for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities.The document also advocates the use of digital ledger technology (DLT) - also known as blockchain - in the public sphere, singling out public relations, healthcare, and education as areas of particular interest.Since it was posted, the draft legislation document has already drawn extensive comments from Ukrainian readers, with one raising the suggestion of regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) separately to other digital assets, given that “widespread fraud” in the ICO space has elicited a generalized distrust of the crypto sphere.Mushak responded that there is as yet little consensus in the Ukrainian parliament as to how to treat ICOs, noting the concern that excessively stringent measures could stifle development.In May, the Ukrainian National Securities and Stock Market Commission (SSMCS) announced it would consider recognizing cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument, suggesting that crypto regulations would for now need to be determined on a national level given that “international standards” are still “a long way off.”In January, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) said it was “considering” introducing a digital version of its national currency, the hryvnia, but one that would not be a state-issued cryptocurrency, i.e. not based on a blockchain protocol.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ukraine    #Cryptocurrencies

Google announced an analogous crypto ad ban in mid-March, and Twitter confirmed its own ban soon after.Last week, multiple mainstream media outlets reported that Facebook is reportedly “exploring” the launch of its own cryptocurrency.Earlier in April, the co-founder of LinkedIn told Cointelegraph that the recent crypto ad bans are, in his opinion, most likely “temporary” and due to the current absence of clear crypto market regulations.",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Microsoft    #Cryptocurrencies    #Bill Gates    #Facebook

The new rules will reportedly be published in the Official Journal of the EU and the member states will have 18 months to transfer them into their national legislation.Authorities are specifically targeting anonymity in the use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, along with the use of consumer banking products, such as prepaid cards.Once it comes into effect, entities such as cryptocurrency exchanges will have to abide by AML guidelines, which will likely include full customer verification, according to the content of the package passed in April.Cointelegraph reported at the time of the Parliament approval that “threats to our citizens and the financial sector” formed the major impetus behind the overwhelming support for the laws.“This legislation helps address the threats to our citizens and the financial sector by allowing greater access to the information about the people behind firms and by tightening rules regulating virtual currencies and anonymous prepaid cards,” MEP Krišj?nis Kari?š said in an accompanying press release.While the impact on the cryptocurrency sphere in countries governed by EU statutes will become clear later, just last week, two exchanges themselves lobbied for regulations to become more set in stone.Eric Demuth, CEO of Austrian platform BitPanda, said formalization of as much of the industry as possible would let operators “know where they stand.”",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Cryptocurrencies    #Anonymity    #AML  
Thailand: Legal Framework For Cryptocurrencies Comes Into Force,Marie Huillet,5/15/2018 4:30,17520,304,"A regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies has come into effect by royal decree in Thailand, the Bangkok Post reported Sunday, May 13.  The 100-section law, published yesterday in the country’s Royal Gazette, defines cryptocurrencies as “digital assets and digital tokens,” and brings them under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Thai Security Exchange Commission (SEC).The Bangkok Post quotes Thai Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong as saying that the new measures are not intended to prohibit cryptocurrencies or Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The Finance Minister’s position reiterates that of the country’s SEC, which has been broadly supportive of ICOs, as long as they are regulated.With the royal decree now in force, sellers of digital assets or tokens must register with the SEC within 90 days. As per the Bangkok Post, failure to do so carries a penalty of up to twice the value of the unauthorized digital transaction, or at least 500,000 baht (about $15,700). Noncompliant sellers could also face a jail sentence of up to two years.The Finance Ministry and SEC will now expand the framework and require all domestic crypto exchanges, as well as independent crypto brokers and dealers, to register with relevant authorities as stipulated by the royal decree.Minister Tantivorawong emphasized that the measures focus on investor protection, as well as preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for criminal activities, money laundering and tax avoidance.The decree has undergone several revisions since it was first introduced in draft form this March. Pending the finalized regulations, uncertainty caused the Thai central bank to prohibit domestic banks from crypto trading and investment in February of this year. That same month, regulatory uncertainty also caused the Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX) to halt ICO trading and registration temporarily. Crypto exchanges themselves have meanwhile been allowed to operate freely.

"Hong Kong Securities Regulator Says Raising Capital Is Job For VCs, Not ICOs",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/16/2018 12:23,9615,209,"The head of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (Hong Kong SFC) said during a speech on April 13 on “New Technologies and Asset Management” that the type of fundraising conducted through Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) is better suited to venture capital funds.Julia Leung, who is also the chair of the 2016 established Fintech Advisory Group, described the current era as the “fourth industrial revolution,” citing scholar Klaus Schwab, due to its new technological innovative promise. Leung notes that although the Hong Kong SFC in its role as a securities regulator sees new technologies like Blockchain as beneficial, she underlines that embracing this new technology comes with some important caveats:“While we acknowledge that innovative technologies such as [B]lockchain have the potential to improve efficiency and financial inclusion, that does not entitle anyone to conduct fundraising from the public in violation of securities law. Because of the highly technical content and opacity of some of these projects, it is hard for an average investor to pick winners, a job more suited for professional investors such as venture capital funds.”Leung adds the the reality is that many of the ICOs are “dubious, if not downright frauds [...] [that] escape the scrutiny of the police or securities regulators because of their crossborder nature and the way the crypto assets are structured to fall outside any regulator’s perimeter,” mentioning the recent hacking of crypto exchanges in Japan and South Korea as a “sharp reminder of the risks” of crypto trading.In February of this year, the Hong Kong SFC warned crypto investors about the risks of investment and vowed to keep policing ICOs and crypto markets. In March, the securities regulator shut down Black Cell Technology’s ICO on the ground that it was an unregistered securities offering, making the company return the funds it had raised to investors.Moving forward with a crypto regulatory framework, Leung notes that the G20 recently spoke about the crypto sphere at their last meeting in March. In terms of Hong Kong specifically, Leung said that the Hong Kong SFC is working with their Investor Education Center to make crypto investors more aware of risks, as well as working with organizations overseas for fintech collaboration.The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Market (HKEX) announced in March that they would be opening a dialogue with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on Blockchain innovation and implementation.

A week later, the state-owned  Banco del Estado de Chile followed the move by confirming the closure of the accounts of all three crypto exchanges.The Chilean cryptocurrency community launched the tag on Twitter #ChileQuiereCryptos (Chile Wants Crypto) to support the industry and retain the ability for citizens to buy and trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), as well as locally launched coins Chaucha and Luka.

"How Australia Is Becoming A Cryptocurrency Continent: Markets, Regulations And Plans",Darryn Pollock,4/15/2018 19:20,58214,965,"The very nature of cryptocurrencies dictate that regulation, control, and by extension, a centralized system, do not fit in with what they stand for. They are supposed to be totally decentralized, and therefore not dictated by many rules.This made a lot of sense when cryptocurrencies were not in the spotlight, and not a major factor on the world stage. However, as mainstream adoption has increased, and more individuals have entered the market, so has the interest from governments and regulators around the world.This has culminated with the G20 summit sitting down and discussing how to fit this decentralized financial system into today’s global society. However, one nation is forging its own path, not hanging around with a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude.Australia has been very direct and positive in terms of cryptocurrency regulation and is already implementing some of its bigger plans, like exchange registration. However, their plans and rules relating to cryptocurrencies are not unreasonable, stifling, or damaging, rather, they could be viewed as progressive and potentially uplifting for both the country and cryptocurrencies in general.Australia may not be one of the biggest markets for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, but it is a growing one. As it stands, Australia is ranked 14th globally for BTC volume by currency. At time of publishing, the Australian dollar (AUD) saw volumes of AUD $2,810,190, or 276 BTC over a 24 hour period.To put that in perspective, Japan sits on top, with a 60 percent dominance, processing 30,1404 BTC over 24 hours. Australia’s market activities pale in comparison to Japan’s, but globally, they are a rather large player.On April 11, the Australian government, through the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), announced tangible plans to implement new rules on cryptocurrency exchanges. The major one being that: “Digital currency exchanges (DCE), with a business operation located in Australia must now register with AUSTRAC and meet the Government’s AML [anti money laundering]/CTF [counter terrorism financing] compliance and reporting obligations,” the announcement read.They have already licensed three exchanges - BTC Markets, in Melbourne being the first, and Sydney-based Independent Reserve being another underpinned by the Australian Digital Commerce Association (ADCA). AUSTRAC have set a deadline of May 14 for the rest of those within the country to comply.Blockbid, another Melbourne based exchange, became the third of these exchanges to gain an AUSTRAC license, but this comes before Blockbid’s upcoming Beta launch, furthering the company’s plans to hold a full-scale launch of Blockbid in 2019.As is often the case with governmental regulations of cryptocurrencies, the main aim is to stop money laundering and terrorism financing through cryptocurrencies because of their anonymous and global nature. However, the report states that “regulation will also help strengthen public and consumer confidence in the sector,” AUSTRAC CEO Nicole Rose commented.That truly is the crux of Australia’s attempts to regulate cryptocurrency in the country. The country is trying to protect citizens, and financial sector, but at the same time, trying to grow and incorporate the technology.This latest move by Australia to licence exchanges indicates that the government is trying to get involved and in control of cryptocurrencies in their country. These licences may be tangible evidence of cryptocurrency regulation, but Australia has built up a positive outlook on digital currencies.Australia followed Japan in declaring Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, as legal tender. Japan’s move in declaring Bitcoin as legal tender came in March 2016, while Australia followed that precedent on July 1, 2017.Australian regulators’ opinions on cryptocurrencies have also grown and expanded as the interest in digital currencies has taken off. On September 20, 2017, it was announced that Australia would be taking away their initial law on double taxation for the digital currency. The legal bill ended the practice of taxing the purchase of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies according to the Australian goods and services tax (GST).Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have also been in their sights, with this facet of the cryptocurrency space often heavily criticized by regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the USA, and the outright ban in China, back in Sept. 2017. Soon after China’s move, In Oct. 2017, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) launched its own set of guidelines for ICOs to follow.The guidelines state that the legal treatment for the usage of ICOs depend on the natural structure of the tokens, be they security or utility based, that is to say token sales are categorized under general Australian consumer law given, that the ICO structured company is not offering financial products, as this will be regulated under the country's Corporations Act.Their stance was still strong, but their guidelines were at least available for ICOs to follow, letting companies deciding on going down this path where they stood depending on what type of tokens they built.The Australian tax office has taken tangible steps to regulate and control taxable growth and expenditure with cryptocurrencies. These steps include the Australian Tax Office (ATO) using data matching and “100-point identification checks"" to track down cryptocurrency investors, as well as bilateral tax treaties and anti-money laundering commitments to get more information out of the traditionally anonymous crypto sphere and markets, proving again how thorough, and determined, they are to keep cryptocurrencies in line with their policies.All this firm and direct regulation could well get up the noses of those operating within the cryptocurrency space as they suddenly have a bevy of new rules to follow that were not even in place when they were setting up shop.But, for the most part, the response from different industries in Australia has been positive.Loretta Joseph, chair of the Australian Digital Commerce Association (ADCA) mentioned how her organization worked with the government in order to get a fair balance:""The ADCA worked very closely over the last 18 months with the Australian government and regulators, AUSTRAC, to bring clarity and oversight to an industry that needed guidance and formal regulation in order to allow industry players to adhere to standards.”“Australia, as a mature market with one regulator who is open to innovation and a government with an innovation agenda, can be a clear leader in the responsible adoption of blockchain technology.""It is all quite obvious why these regulations are good for the Australian government, who are fighting perceived threats of money laundering and terrorist funding, but crypto businesses and the different industries that utilize cryptocurrencies, also are benefiting. More so though, this level of regulation has massive implications for the cryptocurrencies themselves.With the rise in adoption, mass media appeal, hype and generally a push for every day people, such as those watching Ellen DeGeneres’ show, as well as John Oliver’s, to understand cryptocurrencies, the feeling is that they won't be going away now. However, the more attention they bring also means more opinions on movements and fluctuations.Bubble talk surrounds Bitcoin, however, such moves by Australia may actually prove it to be otherwise, this is the opinion of Australian crypto writer for Forbes, James Nguyen.Nguyen explains how Australia has taken time and effort to build new legislation around an emerging technology. It shows, firstly, that cryptocurrencies are moving so fast that they have outgrown legacy regulations, and secondly, that Australia sees a need for active legislation on something it predicts will not go away:“By investing resources in research and new legislation, Australia’s government shows its commitment to the perceived longevity of cryptocurrencies as it tries to answer these questions.The government has a responsibility to protect its members and thus by amending legislation to include cryptocurrencies, rather than prohibiting them, it signals a belief of a future for the asset class beyond the market’s current exuberance.”Gone are the days of cowering and shunning regulations for the mere fact that they infringe on some sort of exaggerated financial liberation. Banks have often tried to bring down Bitcoin in fear of them infringing on their business, using regulation as their weapon.If cryptocurrencies are to be mainstream and adopted, and cause the financial revolution that many believe is possible, they will go a lot further in this quest if they operate within the laws.Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash, a prominent cryptocurrency that has goals of being globally adopted as a speedy payment system, believes that the industry, as it stands, is hungry for cryptocurrency regulation, and with exchanges in Australia now being given guidelines, there can be no more confusion.Dash may be based in the USA, and have a strong presence in Europe, with many master nodes based there, but positive cryptocurrency regulations play a big role globally, as digital currencies are global systems.""These are Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML rules that we've seen in other markets, such as the United States. The positive aspect of this announcement is that Australian authorities are providing increased regulatory certainty by designating the exact regulatory body that cryptocurrency exchanges will need to engage with moving forward. It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next six months as the Australian market transitions to this new regulatory regime.”“As an industry, we've been asking for regulatory clarity for the exchanges, and good faith in implementing these changes. This regulation seems to go in that line, but until we see how it is implemented we can't fully judge.""Although Australia is just one country, one country leading the way can set a precedent, but it is not necessarily true that others will follow. The G20 proved that when they said that they need to come to a general agreement on reguations, but Brazil indicated straight away that they will most likely not follow the G20 recommendations, when they are announced in July this year.Arnold Spencer, Coinsource general counsel and former attorney for the US Department of Justice also sees it as a positive move emanating from one country, but is not convinced that this is the be-all and end-all.""Australia’s new regulations reflect broader trends. Countries across the globe are increasingly monitoring businesses and their customers that buy and sell digital currencies to address money laundering concerns. Regulations like these will lead to widespread adoption.”""Unfortunately, it’s all reactive. All these new efforts to adopt digital currency regulations are piecemeal. One country passes regulations for exchanges. Another country adopts policies for ICOs. A third country passes new tax policies. But no one seems to have a comprehensive, forward-thinking digital currency strategy.""Australia has decided that there is a lot of potential in cryptocurrency.  By encompassing Blockchain, as well as financial upgrades with digital tokens, they are setting themselves up almost as a ‘first-to-market’. If the Australians can get their regulations into force earlier, they can grow a system that works for them and one that will be ahead of all others who are still undecided.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Taxes    #Cryptocurrencies    #G20    #Markets  
"Russia: Crypto Bill Review Regulates Crypto-Fiat Transactions Over $9.6K, Report Says",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/15/2018 15:55,20988,193,"The Russian government has reportedly prepared a review of the draft bill “On Digital Financial Assets,” detailing that the exchange of cryptocurrency for fiat for more than 600,000 rubles (about $9,600) or its foreign equivalent is subject to mandatory currency exchange regulation, according to local crypto news outlet Forklog Friday, April 13.This review has not yet been presented to the State Duma, according to Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the financial market committee. Forklog notes that transactions of more than 600,000 rubles are already tracked by Russian banks for prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing.The latest version of the “On Digital Financial Assets” draft bill, submitted to the State Duma on March 20, 2018, defines crypto and digital tokens as digital financial assets that can only be traded on authorized crypto exchanges, as well as details KYC regulations for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). The March 20 version of the bill would also require user accounts at crypto exchanges to be verified for AML and and counter terrorism financing (CTF).Crypto exchange operators should be subject to Article 5 of Federal Law 115-FZ (against AML and CTF) or they will lose their license, according to Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service.Yuri Pripachkin, the president of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB), said that the latest version of the bill, which requires crypto transactions to fall under bank and Federal Financial Monitoring Service control, may make Russian crypto miners leave the country to work in more “crypto-friendly” places. Forklog notes that the recent draft bill review does not mention taxes on crypto mining profits.As the draft bill classifies crypto as property – thus not a legitimate payment system in Russia – the government also wants to tax digital asset transactions.According to Teimuraz Vashakmadze, an associate professor at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, a 13 percent personal income tax could be imposed on crypto traders, although the anonymity of crypto trades may make this difficult:“If the person themselves does not announce that they bought and sold Bitcoins, then no one will know about it, so many people will not voluntarily declare such income.""According to RACIB in January 2018, the long-discussed “CryptoRuble,” a state-issued cryptocurrency, would be launched in mid-2019.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Fiat Money    #KYC    #ICO    #AML    #Banks    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Money Laundering    #Mining  
"Lithuanian Central Bank Initiates Dialogue On Crypto Between Banks, Regulators, Traders",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/15/2018 12:53,15799,413,"The Bank of Lithuania has reportedly begun looking into cryptocurrencies, initiating a dialogue between commercial banks, government regulators, and crypto traders, local news outlet The Baltic Times reports today, April 15.The central bank had invited representatives from the Financial Ministry, the Financial Crime Investigation Service (FNTT), the banking sector, and the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) sector to a recent crypto roundtable, according to Jekaterina Govina, the fintech strategy coordinator at the Bank of Lithuania.Govina notes that regardless of the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, “blind denial, reluctance to understand and to work with the cryptocurrency world leads nowhere,” continuing:""It's necessary that banks speak to those who have carried out an ICO or those who convert cryptocurrencies into conventional money. A dialog has been established and it remains to be seen where it will lead us.”Lithuania’s central bank issued a document on Oct. 10 of last year detailing its position towards ICOs and cryptocurrencies. In the doc they state that financial market participants (FMP) should separate their financial services activities from those associated with virtual currency. It also states that FMP should In providing financial services to customers who are engaged in activities associated with manage the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing when providing financial services to customers who are dealing in crypto.According to The Baltic Times, although Lithuania’s central bank requires a “clear separation” between traditional financial services and crypto-related activities, the bank will “issue licenses cheaply and quickly” – evidently for ICOs – as well as accept license applications in English, as part of its goal to become a “European fintech hub”.Reportedly, one problem for crypto-related business in Lithuania is the difficulty of working with banks, according to Vytautas Kaseta, a board member at Blockchain Center Vilnius:""Commercial banks don't understand the nature of the crypto-business and the business model. Therefore, they regard it as a high-risk business and require additional proofs of the origin of money and investment, and often refuse to open accounts for companies.”In response, the Lithuanian Banks’ Association (LBA) has said that while a dialogue is needed, the potential for crypto to play a role in illegal activities means that there is a necessity for proof of a client’s source of funds:“We are interested in speaking to everyone to better understand each other's business models, but consumer protection, money laundering and terrorist financing prevention is a priority that must be ensured. We understand from the meeting that some of cryptocurrency market participants cannot say where the money comes from. This is a serious problem, and they didn't realize it was a problem.”In November of last year, the finance ministers in Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia signed a Memorandum of Understanding for fintech cooperation, including supporting Blockchain innovation across the Baltics.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Lithuania    #Central Bank    #Banks    #Tradings  
Malta Regulator Seeks Feedback On Proposed Crypto Financial Instrument Test,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/15/2018 10:55,14450,310,"The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has released a consultation paper on the possible introduction of a “Financial Instrument Test” that would legally define virtual tokens, according to an April 13 announcement on their site.The Financial Instrument Test, first proposed in a Nov. 30 paper on Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), virtual currencies, and related service providers, would determine whether a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) asset falls under EU and traditional financial regulations or Malta’s proposed Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFAA).In response to positive feedback received about the Financial Instrument Test, the MFSA said in their April 13 circular that they are “considering the introduction of the Test as a mandatory requirement under the VFAA, applicable both within the context of an Initial Coin Offering (‘ICO’) as well as during the intermediation of DLT assets.”The consultation paper on the Financial Instrument Test notes that the MFSA is “seeking feedback from the industry” before moving forward with a final variation of the test, and the public can voice their opinions through a survey active through May 4.Malta is currently attempting to build a reputation as the “Blockchain island,” through creating a crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Malta had released a document in February – “Malta - A leader in DLT Regulation” – and proposed the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Bill and the VFAA to bring crypto-related business to the island.The world’s largest crypto exchange by trade volume (at press time) Binance recently announced they would open an office in Malta, a move welcomed personally by the prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat.

Sanctions Compliance For Transactions in Fiat And Cryptocurrencies Are The Same: Expert Take,Selva Ozelli,4/13/2018 10:16,17635,216,"In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to george@cointelegraph.com.Cryptocurrency and its underlying Blockchain technology has captured widespread public investor interest including those who use them to evade international sanctions.  Hostile state and non-state actors alike have been turning to use “privacy coins” with built in mixing services or privacy centric Blockchain designs for two reasons. First, they are fast becoming the preferred way to launder money globally.  Second, while G20 countries recently agreed to implementing the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing standards, currently there are no global standards for regulating cryptocurrency exchanges, with many lacking risk, sanctions-screening, and anti-money laundering (AML) programs.For example, up until March 19, 2018, those individuals and enterprises that purchased “privacy coin” Zcash in Venezuela, as an optional intermediate step to converting bolivars into US dollars; or those who bought Venezuela’s national cryptocurrency “Petro” with fiat currencies Turkish liras, Chinese yuan, Russian rubles, the euro or with cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NEM -- were not subject to “US sanctions”.  This was the opposite of Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad, who was arrested on US charges that he funneled money from Tehran-linked businesses to Venezuela through American banks, and thereby participated in a scheme to evade US sanctions and money laundering. According to his thirty-four-page long indictment, Hashemi Nejad chaired a Maltese Bank and laundered more than $115 mln via multiple shell companies in Switzerland, Turkey, and the British Virgin Islands through the US financial system, tied to a $476 mln bilateral construction agreement obligating Iran to build 7,000 housing units in Venezuela with Venezuela's state-owned energy company.But March 19, 2018 was a watershed moment, not only for Hashemi Nejad who is facing up to 125 years in jail for US sanction violations; but also for the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.  It is the date when President Donald Trump banned American citizens and enterprises from buying the Venezuelan oil-backed cryptocurrency “Petro” based on an executive order.The Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin explained that the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) would use economic sanctions and new cryptocurrency rules to fight against criminal use of cryptocurrencies:“President Maduro’s regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency – a ploy that Venezuela’s democratically-elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned US persons to avoid.  As a result of today’s actions, all assets of the current or former officials of the Government of Venezuela that are subject to US jurisdiction are frozen, and US persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them.”  Under OFAC’s newly issued cryptocurrency guidance, US persons will have the same sanctions compliance obligations regardless of whether transactions involve fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.   Sanctions violations involving cryptocurrencies are expected to result in enforcement actions that are similar to those imposed on persons that use fiat currencies.The US Government is also considering adding digital currency addresses or wallets affiliated with individuals and entities identified to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (“SDNL”). This would put US persons on notice that doing business with those digital addresses may be prohibited, increasing compliance considerations for businesses delving into the world of virtual currency.All US persons are required to comply with OFAC regulations, block the property (including goods, contracts, and funds of any form) of sanctioned persons and make timely reports to OFAC. Failure to do so may result in significant civil and criminal penalties.Sanctioned nations like Iran, similar to Venezuela, are also contemplating issuing national and even multi-national cryptocurrencies. The latest economic sanction OFAC imposed was on last Friday, April 6,  to “the Russian government, which operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites,” according to  Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.The sanctions rattled world stock and  currency markets, so much so that it cost the Russian oligarchs $16 bln on Black Monday alone. The ruble fell to its lowest level against the dollar since late 2016, while shares in sanctioned aluminum producer Rusal, which is controlled by the billionaire Oleg Deripaska, plunged more than 50 percent on the Hong Kong stock exchange.""I have never seen a market this volatile, to this extent, in my career,"" explained the 88-year-old investing veteran Jack Bogle, the chairman of Vanguard in an interview with CNBC. “Now that’s only 66 years, so I shouldn't make too much about it, but you're right: I've seen two 50 percent declines, I've seen a 25 percent decline in one day, and I've never seen anything like this before.""Indeed, the OFAC program has been aggressively freezing assets of embargoed countries, prohibiting payment of funds to individuals and countries on the embargo list, or prohibiting provision of services to countries subject to US sanctions.  Some OFAC sanctions are more restrictive than others, and apply to the whole country, while others specifically target certain individuals or entities within a country. The current sanctioned list is extensive, and includes ex-Yugoslavian nation states, Belarus, Burma, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine/Russia, Venezuela, ?Yemen and Zimbabwe, Transnational Criminal Organizations and thousands of individuals.  Undoubtedly, the OFAC’s new cryptocurrency rules represent another step in the march towards fully regulating cryptocurrency operations.  Slowly but surely, cryptocurrencies are being brought under existing US regulatory schemes. With the US government’s stated commitment to enforcement of economic sanctions measures and the rapidly evolving nature of cryptocurrency markets and technologies, investigations may follow from OFAC’s recent guidance.  With that in mind, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reminded US taxpayers with cryptocurrency gains from foreign cryptocurrency exchanges to comply with Foreign Financial Accounts (FBAR) Reporting and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting requirements by the upcoming deadline of April 17, 2018.The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com. Selva Ozelli, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for Tax Notes, Bloomberg BNA, other publications and the OECD.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #AML    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
Silk Road Federal Prosecutor: Blockchain Played Key Role In Investigation Of Fed. Agents,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/12/2018 20:32,16816,265,"Former federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun spoke about the non-criminal nature of Bitcoin and the use of Blockchain of criminal investigations during an interview with Quartz published today, April 12.During the interview, Haun, who worked on well-known crypto cases like that of US federal agents’ involvement in fraud and extortion during the Silk Road investigation, argued that Bitcoin is not itself criminal, as well as explained the importance of her use of Blockchain records for catching criminals. Haun currently teaches a class on cryptocurrency and cybercrime at Stanford University and serves on the board at crypto wallet and exchange service Coinbase.During her time in government, Haun led a task force that prosecuted cases involving criminal uses of cryptocurrency. During the interview with Quartz, she made the distinction that the investigations did not take place just because cryptocurrency was used:“I quickly learned prosecuting the technology of bitcoin wasn’t possible, number one; nor was it desirable, number two [...] The task force I was leading was focused on some of the worst criminal use cases involving cryptocurrency. I want to stress it wasn’t because cryptocurrency was used; it was because crimes were committed. It wasn’t about the medium of transaction.”During the 2013 Senate hearing about Bitcoin, Haun also stresses that others in the government also saw cryptocurrencies as not necessarily illegal entities:“[...] the Senate held a hearing, the first hearing it held on Bitcoin. Three government witnesses testified there. All three emphasized the point that there is absolutely nothing illegal about bitcoin or the technology itself.”Haun then turns to the role Blockchain in her work convicting the two federal agents, Carl Force and Shaun Bridges, for stealing Bitcoin while investigating the Silk Road. According to Haun, traditional financial institutions were unhelpful in supplying information for the investigation, they “dragged their heels, they took forever, and in some cases didn’t respond at all.” She continues, “ironically, it was a lot of the evidence we were given by the cryptocurrency platforms and community that helped us crack the case.”Haun describes how government investigators – the Internal Revenue Service, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations – used wallet explorer blockchain.info to look for evidence:“These were public tools, which was an important thing at the time, because these agents were still employed by the federal government. Something that’s not well known is that one of those agents [who was convicted] was the self-appointed digital currency person for the Secret Service. We were really nervous that if we were using any legal process, even a secret government legal process, it would be discovered by the target of our investigation. Having these public tools was very helpful.”In November of last year, the technical architecture lead for the UK’s Ministry of Justice spoke about the possibility for Blockchain to record digital evidence for criminal investigations, specifically in the case of footage from body-cameras worn by police officers.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Silk Road    #Crimes    #Bitcoin News    #Coinbase    #USA  
"Texas Regulator Inspects 32 Crypto Promoters, Warns Of ‘Widespread Fraud’",Marie Huillet,4/12/2018 17:22,12882,703,"The Enforcement Division of the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) has published the findings of its four-week investigation into “suspect” securities offerings tied to cryptocurrencies, in a report released April 10.Starting Dec. 18, 2017, the division opened 32 investigations into promoters of crypto investments, none of whom were registered to sell securities in Texas and therefore – given that they were selling securities under Texas law – were operating “outside the law.”The report contended that “the revolution in digital money is creating an environment ripe with illegal and fraudulent securities offerings,” in which “new technologies” are converging with the “same old emotions” to push investor enthusiasm into overdrive, amid “abundant signs of a cryptocurrency mania.”The report highlights key areas of concern, with promoters “almost universally” touting unrealistic profitability and downplaying investment risks. Others misappropriated or faked identities, or offered unscrupulous “finder’s fee[s]” to lure recruiters in.The report includes five detailed case studies: R2B coin, Davorcoin, LeadInvest, USI-Tech Ltd, and Bitconnect, all of whom were issued emergency cease and desist orders by the TSSB between Dec. 2017 and Feb. 2018. The last of these, Bitconnect, lost 98% of its market cap after the TSSB emergency action. The report warns that the other four companies faced similar fates, with many investors subsequently losing “almost all of their investment capital.”The TSSB concludes by urging investors to conduct due diligence into sellers of crypto investment products, reminding them that they are entitled to the protections of securities regulations.Cryptocurrencies and digital tokens are defined differently by various regulatory bodies in the US, pushing businesses to seek more clarity from regulators, as they did in a Congressional hearing in mid-March. Tokens launched during ICOs have so far been a particular focus for securities regulators, but a host of crypto assets and contracts are now classified as securities worldwide.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Scams    #USA    #Texas    #ICO  
"China: Blockchain Conference Shut Down By Police, Organizers Claim ‘No Legal Issues’",William Suberg,4/12/2018 11:36,21076,211,"Organizers of a Chinese Blockchain conference that police suddenly shut down have denied rumors they invited a suspected fraudulent Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to the event, local news outlet YMTMT.com reported Thursday, April 12.Local media reports cite PTP International, the organizers behind the Global Fintech & Blockchain China Summit 2018 (GFBCS) in Shanghai, as saying the only reason given by police for the raid was “security risks”.“We are investigating the reasons for the suspension of the event,” YMTMT.com quotes PTP as telling participants.While many aspects of cryptocurrency use remain illegal in China, Blockchain and fintech have considerably more room for maneuver, with various Chinese conferences continuing to successfully draw in international crowds.According to media sources, there was controversy surrounding GFBCS due to the alleged presence of an unnamed ICO operator, which attendees claim lost them money.Some of those attendees subsequently informed authorities, leading to the sudden infiltration of the event by police, according to local reports.Promising an update on the situation and a possible rescheduling of the remaining portion of the conference, PTP asked the community not to believe or spread “rumors.”“This is a formal event and there are no legal issues related to its content,” the company continued:“Please do not spread rumors or listen to rumors propagated by unscrupulous media.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Conference  
"National Currency, Scam And Police Violence: What’s Going On With Crypto In India",Shivdeep Dhaliwal,4/12/2018 10:16,18475,242,"India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has caused a stir on April 5, 2018 by announcing that it would not allow regulated institutions like banks, payment service providers and non banking finance companies (NBFCs), to provide services to persons or businesses that deal with cryptocurrencies.The RBI undertook this step due to a number of reasons which they claim as, “consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others.” As the statement cites:“[The] Reserve Bank has repeatedly cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies.In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs [venture capitalists]. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified time. A circular in this regard is being issued separately.”Bibhu Prasad Kanungo, the deputy director of the RBI personally extended this message on a press conference:“Internationally, while the regulatory response to these tokens are not uniform, it is universally felt that they can seriously undermine the AML (anti-money laundering) and FATF (Financial Action Task Force) framework, adversely impact market integrity and capital control. And if they grow beyond a critical size, they can endanger financial stability as well.”The reaction to India’s move has been one of dismay. Tech investor Tim Draper, who has been in and out of the Indian markets, minced no words - calling the Indian government’s actions “the stupidest thing”:“If I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake.”On April 5, 2018, trading platform Bitbns administered a petition, warning the government and the public about the possibility of “brain drain”:“This is clearly stifling innovation around Blockchain. If a government does not facilitate adoption of new technology the country stands to left behind. It's not that a Google or an Apple gets created by a [government]. It's when entrepreneurs are provided the best possible launchpad when this happens. If as a govt you do not provide that - that's when people like Sundar Pichai or Satya Nadella have to leave the country and they become creators for some other countries.”However, the announcement from the RBI did not appear to negatively affect rates of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) was seen trading near the $7000 mark with Ethereum  (ETH) in the region of $400.The two popular exchanges in India are Unocoin and ZebPay. After the news of RBI’s decision to bar banks from interacting with cryptocurrency entities, Cointelegraph contacted ZebPay for comment, but has not received any response. The only mode of communication with its users was e-mail as well as a notice that appeared on their mobile app.Meanwhile, Unocoin has released a press release which made it clear that they have received no notice from their bankers as of now and that funds of their users are safe with them:“We just want to assure you that your funds (INR, BTC and other cryptos) are absolutely safe with us as ever and there is no need to worry about their safety. As always, you can still continue to use our platform as before and if need be you can still withdraw your funds. As on today, no banks (that we are working with) have issued any notice to us and when they do and if it has an impact on you and /or us, we will surely communicate to you.”What has perplexed a lot of cryptocurrency users in India has been the Indian government’s weird double standards on cryptocurrencies. On one hand the government welcomed the technology behind cryptocurrencies, while on the other discouraged the use of cryptocurrency in the country.In his budget day speech in February, Arun Jaitley, Minister of Finance stated:“Distributed ledger system or the Blockchain technology allows organization of any chain of records or transactions without the need of intermediaries … The Government does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The Government will explore use of Blockchain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy”Then there is the Indian Income Tax department which followed this speech later in February by sending 100,000 ‘tax notices’ to Bitcoin Investors. The Chairman of Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) explained:“People who have made investments (in cryptocurrencies) and have not declared income while filing taxes, and have not paid tax on the profit earned by investing, we are sending them notices as we feel that it is all taxable. We found out that there is no clarity on investments made by many people which means that they have not declared it properly. We have informed all the DGs (Director Generals of Income Tax) across India, they are issuing notices and so that would be taxed.”Following this, the words of Indian officials (and subsequent media reaction) contributed to a massive Bitcoin dip from $10,300 to below $9,512 in one day.Meanwhile, compounding India’s cryptocurrency woes have been two stories that are unrelated to the so called ‘crypto ban’ but have propelled Bitcoin into the news cycle. These stories do cryptocurrency in India no favour as the local media often takes a frenzied tone on these matters and indulges in sensationalism. One has been the arrest of the Bharadwaj brothers. This duo had duped more than 8000 investors out of INR 2000 crores or $300 mln. They ran an investment scheme by the name of Gainitcoin, which promised investors guaranteed 10 percent monthly returns within 18 months. They have also been manipulating price of a token they launched in an initial coin offering (ICO).In another alarming development a businessman Sailesh Bhatt in the western Indian state of Gujarat has made a serious allegation that an officer of India’s Gujarat Police beat him and extorted 200 BTC from him:“They beat me up inside a room and threatened to kill me in a fake encounter if I did not hand over my Bitcoins … Amreli [city in Gujarat] SP Jagdish Patel and Amreli inspector Anant Patel were involved. I was forced to transfer Rs 13 crore [around $2 mln] in Bitcoins to Paladiya's account [Sailesh’s business partner].”Seemingly taxation and regulation occupies officials’ minds more than the safety and security of cryptocurrency investors.The Blockchain economy has its roots in cryptocurrency but also a lot of Blockchain tech firms are rich and store their wealth in cryptocurrencies.  If the Indian government wants these companies to bring in investments, technology and innovation to the country, it has to take a liberal stance. Otherwise, everyone has the freedom to choose jurisdictions which have easier regulations.There are already some indications that major cryptocurrency companies in India are thinking of abandoning the country. Shivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin was explicit enough to tell the Economic Times:“We have to move our company to some foreign country where regulations allow opening of bank accounts plus we won't be dealing in fiat currency. It will become a global operation rather than an India centric operation.”Others too have expressed a need for a rethink on the position that the central bank has taken. As Navin Surya, Chairman of the Payment Council of India referring to the RBI decision told Bloomberg Quint:“Risks exist in every system but we have solutions to each of those. So why not work with virtual currency traders in a similar way and create a risk-free system rather than indirectly shutting it down.”It’s important to remember about the Reserve Bank ambitions towards the idea of its own cryptocurrency, named after the Indian goddess of wealth Laxmi. In the same press release that barred regulated financial institutions from dealing with crypto-related businesses, the RBI announced its intents to study the feasibility of a ‘Central Bank Digital Currency’:“Rapid changes in the landscape of the payments industry along with factors such as emergence of private digital tokens and the rising costs of managing fiat paper/metallic money have led central banks around the world to explore the option of introducing fiat digital currencies.While many central banks are still engaged in the debate, an interdepartmental group has been constituted by the Reserve Bank to study and provide guidance on the desirability and feasibility to introduce a central bank digital currency. The Report will be submitted by end-June 2018”.  Cryptocurrencies have a hidden strength in that they are decentralised. Indians can still trade in cryptocurrencies by using popular peer-to-peer systems like Bisq and localbitcoins or by simply exchanging Bitcoin for fiat with their local dealers. This strategy has worked in China where similar ban was imposed by the authorities.If anything, this decision of the RBI would do Bitcoin users a favour, pushing them to discover that Bitcoin’s open secret, that it can be used by anyone, anywhere without fear and without the fear of state intervention. Hopefully India would be one of those thriving markets where people exchange Bitcoin for goods, services and fiat currency on a person to person level.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #AML    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #Taxes  
Alibaba’s Taobao Expands Crypto Regulations By Banning ICOs And Associated Services,Helen Partz,4/11/2018 22:45,14092,202,"Chinese online shopping website Taobao, a subsidiary of retail giant Alibaba, will be banning stores on the platform from providing services related to Initial Coin Offering (ICOs), according to the press release published on Tuesday, April 10.The official statement offers an update of the firm’s previous cryptocurrency-related restrictions, which banned Taobao’s customers from services related to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), as well as from offering cryptocurrency mining tutorials, Bitcoin mining machines, and other related hardware.The new regulatory framework that will take effect starting April 17, consists of two major changes. First, the new rules expand the concept of virtual currencies by incorporating ICOs and other “similar digital products.” Secondly, they establish increased control of derivative services of digital products based on Blockchain technology.By implementing these new regulations, Taobao aims to protect customers from financial risks associated with services related to ICOs, including illegal fundraising and easy speculation. Recalling the decision of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to ban ICOs in September 2017, Taobao reminded users that no institution may provide trading, exchange, pricing, brokerage, payment, or other services of “digital currencies or similar digital products.”Taobao said that stores which violate the new rules and keep offering ICO-related services such as white paper writing services, will suffer punitive measures.Last week, Cointelegraph reported that Alibaba sued the Dubai-based Alibabacoin Foundation ICO for copyright infringement that involved “prominent, repeated, and intentionally misleading” behavior using the company’s name.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #China    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
Philippines’ SEC Demands Crypto Cloud Mining Contracts To Be Registered As Securities,Marie Huillet,4/11/2018 13:25,10685,213,"The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an advisory on Cryptocurrency Cloud Mining Contracts that applies the Howey Test to classify these contracts as securities, the SEC outlined April 10.Cloud Mining contracts fall within the purview of securities law because they are “investment contracts,” whereby investors stake the mining capacity of a remote datacenter through the contract, which can itself then further be traded.Applying the 71-year old Howey Test, this qualifies as an investment in a “common enterprise,” in which investors are led to “expect profits” that are “generated from the efforts of others.”The Philippines’ SEC advisory requires all brokers, dealers, salesmen or recruiters involved in “enticing the public” to invest in these contracts to obtain registration or seek an appropriate license. Failure to do so will henceforth be regarded as an “unregistered issuance of securities” liable to criminal prosecution, with a maximum penalty of 21 years’ imprisonment.In late 2017, the Philippines’ SEC announced plans to classify ICOs under the Securities Regulation Code. Earlier that year, the Philippines' central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method, and started processing license applications from the country’s crypto exchanges.BSP deputy director Melchor Plabasan clarified the twofold approach the country’s financial regulators are taking towards cryptocurrencies and related assets, seeing them as both monetary and investment instruments.In March 2018, a Philippine senator filed a bill to impose stricter penalties for crypto-related crimes, citing corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism as her main concerns.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #Philippines    #Security  
Taiwan: Finance Ministry Confirms Crypto Regulation Using Existing AML Laws,William Suberg,4/11/2018 12:47,9449,238,"The government of Taiwan confirmed it will create cryptocurrency regulation based on extant anti-money laundering (AML) practices April 10.In a statement, the nation’s finance ministry said it had opted to use AML rules already applied to traditional financial instruments as a basis to reigning in the burgeoning cryptocurrency economy.Citing “increased risks” of money laundering among virtual currency investors reported by the government’s AML outfit Financial Action Task Force, the ministry added it had met with two Taiwanese exchanges - BitoEX and MaiCoin - in a bid to “understand” the industry’s perspective.The news comes a week following the Taiwanese central bank’s recommendation that AML laws should extend to cover cryptocurrency.A move closer to full regulation of Bitcoin and altcoin activity puts Taiwan increasingly at odds with mainland China, where cryptocurrency exchange and ICO participation remain banned.Moving forward, the finance ministry says, it will enter a consultation phase with “relevant agencies, law enforcement and researchers” in order to gain a comprehensive overview of the local landscape.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taiwan    #AML

Signs Appear Suggesting Chinese Government May Have Entered Cryptocurrency Market,Alex Gao,10/10/2017 14:25,32434,659,"After Chinese government’s ban of ICOs last month, there are continuous rumors saying that Chinese government is preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market. However, no official announcement has been made to verify the rumor.Before Oct. 10 Beijing time, there was no substantial evidence backing up these rumors. Nevertheless, a few hints might show that Chinese government is entering, or has already entered the market.On Oct. 10, the updated Biance APP shows that the developer of the APP is Ping An Bank Co., Ltd, which is a Chinese joint-stock commercial bank, with its headquarters in Shenzhen with a government background.Biance has issued its token coin, called the Bianace Coin(BNB) three months ago. It runs negatively on the Ethereum Blockchain with ERC20. On the same day, China Bitcoin also updated its APP, and the developer is Xiamen Local Taxation Bureau.""Maybe Ping An Bank’s involvement can be explained as commercial activities, but Xiamen Local Taxation Bureau’s control over China Bitcoin demonstrates the Chinese government’s interest in ICO and Bitcoin.""Until now, there’s still no official confirmation. Nobody can be one hundred percent sure what Chinese government is going to do next.In fact, the CEO of Biance just claimed that Ping An Bank did not purchase Biance. However, he didn’t explain why the developer of Biance’s APP is Ping An Bank now. Meanwhile, Xiamen Local Taxation Bureau hasn’t said anything yet.Though the CEO of Biance refuted the “rumor”, there’s still no solid evidence or explanation proving that whether the Chinese government has entered the market or not.Considering the size of the Chinese market, if the government indeed gets involved in the market, an earthquake is about to happen.",13,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Markets    #China    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #ICO  
Bitcoin Price Flash Crashes As Russia Proposes Crypto Exchange Ban,Darryn Pollock,10/10/2017 14:10,41527,564,"Russia’s central bank is planning to ban access to Bitcoin exchange websites, it was announced by Sergei Shvetsov, the first deputy governor at the Russian central bank.This announcement had a severe effect on the Bitcoin price that was rallying towards $5,000. In a flash crash, Bitcoin’s value dropped by $600 before rebounding somewhat.Shvetsov said in his speech at a conference in Moscow that:""We can not stand apart. We can not give direct and easy access to such dubious instruments for retail (investors),"" Shetsov said.“We think that for our citizens, for businesses, the usage of such cryptocurrencies as an investment object carries unreasonably high risks.”He went on to indicate that Russia would block access to websites of exchanges that offer Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.This news had an adverse effect on the market as Bitcoin dropped by over $600 to a low of $4,200 at roughly 9:00 a.m. London time, the same time as the announcement from Russia's central bank.  However, it quickly recovered, within moments, getting back to $4,784 by 9:10 a.m. London time.This news follows on from China’s hard-nosed approach to digital currencies after they first banned ICOs, then went after exchanges.Russia has said before that it would like to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies by Russian citizens and companies.This move seems to be in line with the idea of government control over Bitcoin.

Abu Dhabi Begins Their Path to ICO Regulation,Darryn Pollock,10/10/2017 13:30,10545,409,"Abu Dhabi's Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), have released guidelines on ICOs and digital currencies for the first time. Their stance on ICOs is that they are similar to securities and are risky, while digital currencies are seen more like commodities.Many nations are starting to crack down on ICOs, with differing levels of regulations. Some, like China, have totally banned them, while others are being more friendly.Even branding ICOs, or categorising them for that matter, has seen nations differ. The US and its SEC have said that ICOs exhibit signs of being securities, such as giving a person ownership of shares in a company.The FSRA has noted the similarities to securities and has said that if it settles on such a categorisation, it will regulate it similar to a company issuing a new stock.""The ICO market is incredibly diverse in terms of quality - there are some ICOs which constitute high risk,"" Christopher Kiew-Smith, head of fintech strategy at the FSRA, said. ""The disclosures are not there, there are no financial statements, so those are extremely high risk for those seeking returns.""But we are aware of and are working with some firms that want to use ICO tech to fund in a transparent fashion. We have asked firms to bring them within the regulatory framework.""This means, much like the SEC’s regulations, an ICO must approach the FSRA to see if it falls under the body’s regulation. Companies will also have to publish a prospectus, just like a firm would for an initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market.The financial watchdog, the FSRA, also said it would not consider digital currencies legal tender, rather class them as commodities, such as precious metals or fuels. Therefore, they remain unregulated.It is a big score for digital currencies that are already established, and it seems to hint at the fact that Abu Dhabi is trying to strike a balance. They want to protect their citizens from the dangers of ICOs, but they are open to letting the digital currency market flourish unhindered.Neighboring emirate Dubai, for example, recently issued a warning about ICOs and said that it does not regulate them. Dubai has also issued its own state digital coin.The FSRA said that it is currently talking to the Japanese Financial Services Agency about how it has gone about regulating Bitcoin. Abu Dhabi's authorities said it is not ruling out bringing virtual currencies under its regulatory remit.""For us, we do see a lot of challenges in regulating something which was designed not to be regulated. We recently established a fintech reach with the Japanese FSA, and through such cooperation we hope to see how they regulate these and if there are risks they see,"" Wai Lum Qwok, executive director of capital markets at the FSRA, said.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #China    #Banned Bitcoin    #SEC    #Cryptocurrencies    #Markets  
Breaking: Russia Rejects Cryptocurrency as Authorities Block Access to Exchanges,William Suberg,10/10/2017 11:25,27537,996,"Russia’s central bank is leading efforts to shut Internet access to cryptocurrency exchange websites.As local news outlet RBC reports Tuesday, Bank of Russia is working with the country’s general prosecutor to block all exchanges offering Russians the opportunity to buy and sell cryptocurrency.“It’s obvious that when a pyramid (scheme) grows, interest in this pyramid hots up with the high rate of return,” first deputy of the central bank, Sergey Shvetsov, said during an international finance forum in Moscow.Echoing previous comments, Shvetsov added that the pyramid description is a result of “eyeing Bitcoin’s price dynamics over the past two years.”The move is the most sweeping yet from Russian authorities regarding cryptocurrency access for citizens, and echoes the less coordinated bans of various industry resources common until last year.The debate as to how to handle cryptocurrency has raged throughout 2017 in Russia, with various high-profile entities giving conflicting views as to what the future will hold in terms of regulation.This regulation is ostensibly due to go public by the end of the year.In the meantime, not just private investors, but also the business sector faces “too high a risk” using cryptocurrency, Shvetsov said.Financial instruments based on cryptocurrency are “impossible to support,” he continued, adding measures would be taken to “restrict” the ability of the Russian domestic market to interact with them.",18,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies Exchange  
Nepalese Police Arrest Bitcoin Traders Despite Lack of Cryptocurrency Regulation,Joshua Althauser,10/10/2017 11:05,22080,282,"The Nepalese police have arrested at least seven individuals for allegedly being involved in virtual currency trading activities in the country as of early October 2017. The arrests were made despite the absence of regulations covering the trading of cryptocurrencies in the country.Based on local press reports, the suspected traders were arrested by members of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) in Kathmandu and Chitwan. Among those arrested were Prashant Pratap Shah of Kathmandu, Bida Dhakal of Nuwakot, and Mingmar Tamang of Sindhupalchok.According to the CIB’s DSP Jeevan Kumar Shrestha, this is the first time that cryptocurrency exchange operators were arrested in the country.“They have been kept at the police custody. The traded amount will be discovered after further investigation.”The arrests made by the CIB are expected to raise more questions than answers, as the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is not considered illegal, because of the absence of regulations on the issue in the country. Due to the situation, it is still unclear what offenses will be filed against the arrested individuals.Meanwhile, the Nepalese government is already drafting regulatory guidelines covering digital currency trading. Among the possible regulations that will be imposed by authorities is a total ban on the trading of cryptocurrencies.Due to this possibility, digital currency exchange operator Bitsewa has already ceased its operation in early October. The exchange is considered as the Nepalese version of LocalBitcoins.Although digital currency activities in Nepal are not so big, any form of regulation against cryptocurrencies may set a dangerous precedent and hinder innovations in the sector. Due to these developments, it is very interesting to see how the virtual currency industry in the country will develop in the short term.The country has also previously notoriously seized all relief funds in bank accounts ‘to ensure all donations are not misused’.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Police    #Nepal    #Cryptocurrencies  
"Mastercard CEO Attacks Bitcoin, Finds Solace in Government-Backed Cryptos",Darryn Pollock,10/9/2017 17:40,17087,563,"Ajay Banga, CEO of Mastercard, has leveled a scathing attack on any and all cryptocurrencies that are not government mandated, calling them “junk”.Digital currencies are almost direct competition for a company like Mastercard, and when asked his opinion on the futuristic technology, Banga was not complimentary of how things stand at the moment.Knowing that digital currencies are big disrupters in the traditional money market, traditional investors, and now even established money movers, have been scathing.Banga was not totally against the idea of Blockchain-based money and tokenization, however, his big caveat was that it needs to be government backed.“If the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game. We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant. The government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk,” he said.Banga’s attack on Bitcoin brought up nothing new or visionary, spurting the usual concerns without much backing or research. He criticised Bitcoin for its volatility, and use-cases for illegal activities, such as ransomware attacks:“If I pay for a bottle of water in Bitcoin, one day it is two bottles for a Bitcoin the other day it is 9,000 bottles. This does not work. Any currency needs stability and transparency, otherwise you will get all the illegal activities in the world. Why was the ransom for the virus (wannacry ransomware) collected in Bitcoin? Why has China cracked down on Bitcoin?”Banga seems to be another bigwig who has a stake in the game, and thus is not happy to give up that piece of pie. He, along with traditional bankers and investors, are fearful of Bitcoin as it continues to break new ground and blow precedents out of the water.The divide of big names on Wall Street seems to grow daily as those in the camp of Jamie Dimon, who called Bitcoin a ‘fraud’ continue to recruit those who seem to be more fearful than certain.Meanwhile, there are those who are looking to profit, and those who are major backers, despite coming from traditional and closed-off investment channels.Axel Weber, the former President of Bundesbank and Chairman UBS, said:“I get often asked why I‘m so skeptical about Bitcoin, it probably comes from my background as a central banker.”Meanwhile, Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, is taking these knee-jerk reactions as good things.“When the incumbent industry is making statements like this and acknowledging you...it’s a sign that what we’re doing is working...it’s a huge validation,” said Pierce.",27,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #MasterCard    #Government    #Deutsche Bundesbank    #Jamie Dimon    #Wall Street    #China  
IMF Could Issue International Cryptocurrency to Replace Dollar?,Jon Buck,10/8/2017 14:39,39982,1420,"According to the Wall Street Journal, the world may soon have an international cryptocurrency in response to Bitcoin. The story comes as a response to recent comments by Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), encouraging banks and governments to not short-change Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The news should not come as a surprise, after the recent announcement by the Dubai government regarding its intention to issue a state cryptocurrency. Further, recent news indicates a large number of banks anonymously supporting state-issued coins as the Blockchain hype continues.The difficulty with a global digital currency is the centralization factor. A major part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is the decentralized protocol, creating a truly free market where value is based purely on consensus without price fixing.A globalized digital currency, while providing decentralized security, would require the IMF to fix and regulate values in order to manage the flow of money in and out of different countries. Such a system would run contrary to the underlying principles behind Bitcoin.The dollar as the reserve currency for much of the world’s transactional volume means that some major global economies may want a new digital currency to function as the reserve. The IMF coin could potentially replace the dollar in that context, should it become widely accepted. In such a case, the dollar and other national currencies would be restricted to local markets.Some supporters of Bitcoin would argue that there is no need for such a currency from the IMF, since Bitcoin already exists, and without the centralization risks. The greatest hurdle would be Lagarde and other economists embracing and using Bitcoin globally, but the jury is still out.",14,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #IMF    #Cryptocurrencies    #Dollar    #Dubai    #Banks  
Chinese Investors: The Government Doesn't Understand Anything About Bitcoin,Joseph Young,10/8/2017 14:35,32542,593,"Throughout the past month, traders and investors in China have criticized the Chinese government's sudden crackdown on local cryptocurrency exchanges and trading activities.In September, the Chinese government, People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and local financial authorities imposed a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency trading platforms, shutting down some of the global cryptocurrency exchange market’s largest trading platforms including OKCoin, Huobi, and BTCC.The motive behind the Chinese government’s closure of local cryptocurrency exchanges has not been clarified, but several researchers for the PBoC have stated that the country’s central bank considers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as threats to the Chinese monetary system.Last month, in an interview with the PBoC’s state-owned finance news publication Sina, Huang Zhen, a researcher at Central University of Finance and Economics and PBoC, stated:“Cryptocurrencies and other virtual currencies attempt to challenge the sovereign state's right to issue currency, requiring the nationalization of currency issuance. China has a clear understanding of digital forms of money, and is actively engaging in relevant work. The central bank has set up a research group and a digital money research institute to explore the digitization of sovereign money. After this round of virtual money markets supervision, we expect under the auspices of the Chinese central bank to launch our own sovereign digital currency as soon as possible to help maintain China's leadership in the development of global digital finance.”Logically, if the Chinese government intends to go ahead with the strategy of issuing a state-controlled digital currency and considers Bitcoin as a threat to its financial system, the motive behind the government in restricting trading activities around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is quite clear.But, lately, the Chinese government has expressed its optimism towards releasing a licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent cryptocurrency transactions flowing into underground economies and black markets.Such a sudden shift in stance towards Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market has provoked consternation amongst traders and investors within the Chinese cryptocurrency community.Zhang Yanhua, a major Bitcoin investor and a founder of an investment fund focused in cryptocurrencies, stated:""The authorities don't understand anything about Bitcoin!”Sun Minjie, another investor who has recently purchased a large amount of Bitcoin as a vital part of its portfolio, told AFP that the Chinese cryptocurrency community and himself do not expect much from the Chinese government any longer:""I expect nothing from the government... but the fate of Bitcoin does not depend on the Chinese authorities.”David Yermack, finance professor at New York University, shared a similar sentiment to most investors and traders in China, emphasizing that the Chinese government does consider Bitcoin as a threat to its financial system to a certain extent. But, such fear towards Bitcoin and its potential in the global finance sector should be considered as a positive indicator for long-term growth. Yermack said:""They didn't ban Bitcoin, but banned exchanges from trading for speculative purposes. It has a lot to do with problems in the Chinese financial system, that they're worried about this as a competitive threat in some way.""",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Investments    #Government    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Tradings  
ICO’s Still Have Options Despite Increasing Regulation,Jon Buck,10/6/2017 3:20,20310,375,"These days, it seems that regulation for ICOs and token sales is popping up everywhere. The SEC has already famously ruled on the DAO tokens, and both China and Korea have banned ICOs for the foreseeable future. Even the Swiss are starting to get cautious. It may well be that the ‘wild west’ days of the ICO are over.However, some ICOs are seeking new ways to work around regulations in different countries, both regulations that deal with ICOs and other regulations dealing with distributed businesses. Below is a summary of three attempts to overcome regulation in a legal way, and how they might fare.One option to dodge the regulatory climate is to divide the tokens into ‘security’ type tokens and ‘utility’ type tokens. The goal of this work-around is to allow for investment without falling afoul of the SEC.The key distinction between the two coins is the dividend payout. In the case of DCorp, for example, the non-security tokens will hold voting rights on the platform, but the security tokens will receive dividends. This framework allows the company to still issue tokens and receive investments from US investors, while at the same time, protecting themselves from SEC regulatory oversight.Will it work? It seems that by dividing the token, the move may well protect DCorp from SEC oversight. Dividing the tokens means that there are, in fact, two instruments of investment rather than one, and only one of the two will fall within the securities definitions stipulated by the Howey test.Another option that some companies are considering is to simply buyout another entity with the necessary regulatory compliance. By buying the company and transferring the necessary rights or legal controls, the parent company can adopt the business model of the child corporation and dodge regulation.One example of this work-around is Stox, a prediction marketplace where token holders can predict the outcome of any number of events by betting their STX. The company recently announced the buyout of Commologic, a non-Blockchain technology firm that has existing gambling licenses.Stox hopes that the buyout will allow them to actively use these licenses in the UK and Malta, where they had been previously obtained. Stox recently said:“Today Stox became the first regulated ICO prediction platform when it announced its first acquisition of a company with a gambling license, CommoLogic… Through the acquisition, Stox will acquire three gambling licenses from CommoLogic: A software license in the UK., an operating license also in the UK .and a Class 4 (B2B) license in Malta.”Will it work? It seems that it well work, since the Stox distributed platform is close enough to the CommoLogic platform that it can potentially continue on within the same framework and under the same license regimes.Another recent work-around is based on what is called the SAFT agreement. SAFT stands for Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, which essentially limits participants in ICOs to ‘accredited’ or ‘sophisticated’ investors, defined as those with an income of at least $200,000 or net assets above $1 mln.These investors are, by and large, considered to be above the need for regulation because of their level of financial sophistication. In other words, they should know enough to not invest in junk. The agreement is modeled after SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) which limits participants in investments to those who are sophisticated and promises them future equity in companies. Suleyman Duyar of SaftLaunch said:“Investors in Blockchain protocol tokens have high demand for a regulated method of participating in token sales. The SAFT provides a a framework which offers answers to many questions surrounding token sales or ICOs. Issuers can use platforms like ours to communicate with our user base and onboard new accredited investors.”Will it work? The SAFT agreement is considered to be the best overall work-around by some, since it already has a counterpart in the VC world with SAFE, and would likely produce the best and safest results for ICOs within the US regulatory climate. Investors would be accredited by an outside company, which increases the regulatory comfort for the SEC and protects small-scale investors from larger fraudulent schemes.While regulations continue to abound, these sorts of work-around plans will continue to flourish as well.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #SEC    #China    #South Korea    #USA    #Stox    #Tokens  
Malaysian Central Bank Close to Deciding On Digital Currency Regulations,Lisa Froelings,10/6/2017 3:05,11939,222,"The Malaysian central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, has yet to make a decision on how to effectively regulate the use of digital currencies in the country, according to local reports. One of the options being considered by the bank is the possible ban of virtual currencies.Regulating the cryptocurrency market in Malaysia appears harder than expected, and it is turning out to be that way across the globe, as there are still very few countries which have introduced active guidelines on the use of this new form of money.Implementing a complete ban on virtual currencies is impossible under any circumstances since government cannot ban or prohibit what they cannot control.Some possible options that could be used by the central bank, however, are the prohibition of banks from dealing with digital currencies, the closure by banks of customer accounts using cryptocurrencies, and forcing the use of cash through peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces or decentralized exchange models.Despite indecision by Bank Negara Malaysia, it is expected that the issue of regulating cryptocurrencies will become clearer by the end of 2017. It will be quite interesting to see whether the central bank will officially authorize the use of the digital currencies or repress the introduction of new innovations.Meanwhile, a report claiming that China has already banned the use of virtual currencies seems to be inaccurate. It appears that what the Chinese government has done was to prohibit ICOs and temporarily suspend CNY-to-cryptocurrency trading rather than issuing a complete ban on the cryptocurrencies.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Markets    #Central Bank    #P2P    #China  
Crimean Council of Ministers Fires Employees for Mining Bitcoin Using Government Computers,Joshua Althauser,10/5/2017 19:10,9064,199,"Two officials of the Crimean Council of Ministers were terminated after they were caught mining Bitcoin using government computers as of early October 2017. The officials allegedly installed “malicious software” on the government’s server, and programmed more than a dozen computers for the mining of Bitcoin.At a press conference in Sevastopol, Alexander Akshatin, chairperson of the Anti-Corruption Committee of the Republic of Crimea, has announced that the council’s head of information technology (IT) department, and the department’s head of hardware and technical support were already dismissed.“They put malicious software on the server of the Crimean government, which opened access to the information stored on it. Concurrently, more than a dozen computers in the basement of the building were also used which gave this same access.”According to Akshatin, his committee and the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) discovered the illegal activities of the employees just in time.He claimed that the two officials could have mined less than one Bitcoin, but were not able to cash it out. He, however, noted that the price of Bitcoin is currently pegged at $4,000, and even half a Bitcoin is already worth some money. He added that the dismissals of the officials will prevent anyone from committing the same illegal act in the future.“They thought that there was nothing wrong with that. But if we were not on the alert, and some limited information went through this channel, you understand the extent to which this could all turn out. Fortunately, this did not happen.”Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev has announced in July that the ministry is planning to circulate virtual currencies in Crimea to boost the arrival of foreign tourists.Fortune reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Internet Ombudsman Dmitry Marinichev, has proposed the legalization of cryptocurrencies on the peninsula.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Mining    #Government    #Digital Currency    #Alexey Moiseev    #Russia    #Putin  
Chinese Meddling With Bitcoin Exchanges and ICOs Likely to Trigger “Cobra Effect”,Jacob J,10/4/2017 3:20,79832,384,"The Chinese actions of banning ICOs and shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges may be with the intention of preventing ordinary Chinese citizens from incurring financial losses. They should, however, be wary of the Cobra Effect.There is an interesting anecdote about the British rule of India. Worried about the large number of venomous cobras in the Indian city of Delhi, the British government had a brilliant idea: they offered a reward for every dead cobra. While this initially resulted in people killing cobras to claim the reward, it soon resulted in unforeseen problems for the British. People began to breed cobras to claim the reward. When the British realized this, they scrapped the reward program. The people then released the worthless snakes, resulting in an increase in the cobra population. The efforts taken by the British to solve the cobra problem had actually exacerbated the situation.Ceteris Paribus (Latin for all other things remaining unchanged) is a key underlying assumption when people debate solutions to problems. If they fail to consider the side effects or secondary effects of the solution that they propose, they could be in for surprises. The British thought offering a reward for dead cobras would result in people killing cobras and the cobra population decreasing. Similarly, since most cryptocurrency trades take place at exchanges, the Chinese government may have thought shutting down exchanges will decrease the number of people investing in cryptocurrencies. They might just be in for a surprise.What could be the motivation behind the Chinese government's actions of banning ICOs and shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges? One reason could be that the Chinese government would like to make it more difficult for ordinary citizens to buy cryptocurrencies and therefore make it less popular. While there has been a temporary blip in trading volumes, resulting in Bitcoin trading it a discount, it is difficult to say how long it will last. Another reason might be that the Chinese government would like to 'protect' the retail investor by making it difficult for him to buy Bitcoins.However, the decision to shut down cryptocurrency exchanges will likely just drive people who want to buy Bitcoins to enter into PTP trades. These are far riskier than buying Bitcoins through exchanges, with a high risk of fraud.

The strategy was jointly developed by the government and the World Bank, TASS reports.In his statement broadcast on the TV channel “Russia 24,” Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov explained that the inclusion of the topic of virtual currency is necessary to bolster the financial literacy of Russians. Such move is prompted by the interest in cryptocurrencies in the country is growing, even among children.“In the strategy to increase the financial literacy of Russians, it is necessary to include the topic of cryptocurrency. The question of investing in instruments such as cryptocurrencies will, of course, be discussed, and we now see more risks than recommendations on investing in such instruments. So, explaining the possible consequences of investing in unregulated instruments will be one of the issues with which we will speak for the current year and until 2023.”The interest on digital currencies continues to grow in Russia. Based on a nationwide survey carried out by the National Agency for Financial Studies (NAFI) in July 2017, just 28 percent of Russians were aware of the presence of the virtual currencies, including Bitcoin. However, NAFI Project Manager Sergey Antonyan claimed that interest in the cryptocurrencies is increasing.Moreover, at the all-Russian contest called Digital Economy: Generation Z that was held at the Horoshkol high school gymnasium in Moscow in September, Russian children competed and answered questions about such topics as digital currencies, chatbots, Blockchains and biometrics.Meanwhile, the top five educational institutions in the country have integrated virtual currency into their conventional banking and finance courses. Among the schools, there are Moscow State University, Higher School of Economics, and St. Petersburg State University.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Russia    #Government    #Finance  
Cryptocurrency is Hybrid Financial Instrument but Should Not Have Special Treatment,Darryn Pollock,10/2/2017 13:45,7805,233,"There is more to cryptocurrencies than just being money, or currency, and there are very good reasons for them to fall under a tax regulation in the traditional sense.Bitcoin and the like can also be debt and equity, and that automatically lends them to being regulated and taxed just like many other types of finance.Bitcoin can be used to buy into other cryptocurrencies, and Blockchain startups in the way of ICOs and other methods, so it can be argued that they are an equity investment. When these Blockchain startups issue the equivalent of their shares - in the form of an ICO - it is comparable to equity.Cryptocurrencies are also used to finance specific assets, like debt. So essentially it is a single financial instrument that has the advantages of both debt and equity.The question of how to define Bitcoin is still an ongoing debate. It was announced as a currency, but many did not buy that, as its usage changed as its value rose. It became much more a store of value.As a store of value it is then a type of asset, like gold.""Usually if investors acquire or sell an asset, it would be liable to tax, such as the GST. This means people using Bitcoin would be taxed twice when using it.""This was the case for Australia for a time. It would be taxed when the person bought Bitcoin and taxed again when they used it to buy something. Luckily the federal government realised this was a bad idea and moved to repeal the double taxation of Bitcoin.Debt and equity are financial instruments used to raise money to finance economic activity. It is something of a puzzle to financial economists why firms use debt in some instances to raise finance, while using equity in other situations.However, when it comes to cryptocurrency, it can be defined as “dequity”, which is a concept put forward by the 2009 economics Laureate Oliver Williamson. He defined dequity as an instrument of both debt and equity.Cryptocurrency is the only financial instrument that can be defined like this because of its trustless base. Dequity was unworkable was due to opportunism – investors simply could not trust dequity issuers.If cryptocurrency can be defined as dequity, then it can fall under the traditional norms of regulation and taxation. So, how should dequity be regulated?Currently, cryptocurrencies are either being met with acceptance, and many regulators are changing the rules for them - such as in Singapore - or they are being cracked down on - such as in China.""However, it can be argued that regulators should really regulate cryptocurrencies in much the same way as they do existing financial instruments. It shouldn’t be given special treatment.""Despite all the complexity of cryptocurrency it really is simple: it’s a financial instrument that combines all the advantages of money with debt and equity. It’s none of those well known concepts in isolation, but a viable and workable hybrid of all three.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Taxes    #ICO    #Australia  
ECB Board Member: Crypto Is ‘Contagion And Contamination’ Infecting The Global Financial System,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/8/2018 15:35,26390,282,"Yves Mersch, Executive Board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), referred to cryptocurrencies as a risk of “contagion and contamination of the existing financial system” during an interview with 4 Technology on Feb. 8.Both the traditional and crypto markets fell sharply at the beginning of this week, prompting responses from shaken financial institutions like the wave of banks banning credit cards for crypto purchases.Mersch warned of the potential for crypto markets to begin more strongly influencing traditional markets as the two have become more interconnected:“If you increasingly have bridges between the virtual world and the real world and then there is a collapse in this virtual world, it could drain liquidity from the real world. This then becomes a concern for the central bank.”During the Bloomberg interview, Mersch recommended that regulatory options should be looked into even before the upcoming March G20 summit in Argentina, where crypto regulation is expected to be high on the agenda,“For me, one obligation would already be to force the unregulated platforms to report transactions in a harmonized way to repositories so that we would have access to information -- also in order to create a better response.”Mersch adds that ECB is also concerned about the “social and psychological effect” that cryptocurrencies “seem to have.”On Feb. 6, general manager of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Augustín Carstens similarly voiced concerns about the increasing integration between cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. Carstens called Bitcoin a “Ponzi scheme” and warned of a “threat to financial stability” if cryptocurrencies became more connected to the global financial system.Mersch told Bloomberg that the European Central Bank fully agrees with Carstens concern:“You won’t be surprised to know that we at the ECB are fully in line with his views and we have similar worries, or similar endeavors we are working on.”Just yesterday in an interview with CNBC, ECB’s Chair of the Supervisory Board Daniele Nouy said that future involvement of ECB-regulated banks in crypto regulation was “very very low,” and the crypto regulation for ECB itself was “not exactly very high on its to-do list.”",22,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ECB    #Cryptocurrencies    #Markets    #Bloomberg    #Credit Cards    #Argentina    #Ponzi Scheme    #CNBC  
India: Media Creates Panic Over 2-Month-Old Crypto Tax,William Suberg,2/8/2018 12:11,26224,246,"India is “aggressively pursuing” cryptocurrency holders for tax this week, claim mainstream media outlets such as Financial Times and Quartz, despite the policy being in place since December 2017.In a repeat round of misinterpretation of facts surrounding the Indian government’s treatment of cryptocurrency, multiple publications warn that 100,000 investors who “skipped paying taxes” have received letters demanding what they owe.That number “may rise up to 500,000,” Quartz adds.India has been a focus for Bitcoin traders this month after a budget speech by finance minister Arun Jaitley provoked price volatility due to press sources erroneously announcing the country would “ban” Bitcoin.While local businesses such as exchanges decried the headlines as “FUD,” the effect on markets remained palpable.The issue of tax appears little different. Local news outlet Press Trust of India (PTI) originally reported on plans to target “400,000 - 500,000” exchange users for tax payments back in December.The 100,000 letters causing a storm this week appear simply to be the first step in a pre-agreed plan, with no new developments beyond comments from Central Board of Direct Taxes chairman Sushil Chandra.“We found out that there is no clarity on investments made by many people, which means they have not declared it properly… we have informed all the (director generals of income tax) across India. They are issuing notices and so that would be taxed,” Chandra confirmed February 6.The so-called “aggression” on behalf of regulators, according to PTI, further impacts only high-net worth individuals using exchanges - roughly 25% of the total user base.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Taxes    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Mainstream    #Media  
"China Lines Up Its KO Punch, Will It Work?",Darryn Pollock,2/7/2018 15:45,56609,452,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.China has not had the steadiest relationship with Bitcoin. Once, it was the center of the cryptocurrency universe, until it got too big for its boots and starting drawing attention from the controlling government.The bans came, first for ICOs then for exchanges, yet, this only slowed rather than stopped the growth of Bitcoin in general, and cryptocurrencies as a whole, in the People’s Republic. The idea was to stamp out Bitcoin and its affiliates as the Chinese government took exception to this freedom of money and the movement of it over the borders. However, even though these bans were unprecedented and harsh, they never really laid the killing blow.The idea is now that the Chinese government will shut the last door on crypto activity in the state with this ban on trading with a foreign platform through a massive firewall. This move comes only because the regulators had to admit that their previous bans were ineffective.This is another step towards Bitcoin blackout in China, with their state-owned social media and search engines wiping clean any trace of cryptocurrency and ICO advertising in the past few days. This is in line with Facebook’s decision to do the same.Regulation of the cryptocurrency space has been a very divided subject for a lot of nations who have been forced into action by its monumental growth. Mostly it is a case by case scenario where different nations choose their level of control; Japan has accepted the currency and is playing a wait-and-see game, while China is trying to lead the way in terms of stern action.In an article which was recounted by the South China Morning Post, it explained the reasoning for this latest move. The article acknowledged that recent attempts to stamp out digital currencies by shutting down domestic exchanges had failed to completely eradicate trading:“ICOs and virtual currency trading did not completely withdraw from China following the official ban … after the closure of the domestic virtual currency exchanges, many people turned to overseas platforms to continue participating in virtual currency transactions...Overseas transactions and regulatory evasion have resumed … risks are still there, fueled by illegal issuance, and even fraud and pyramid selling.”This is the Chinese government’s last shot at stamping out Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, something that will be eagerly watched by many regulators in terms of a possible avenue to follow. However, should it fail and Bitcoin find another way to function in a society that has become accustomed and ingrained with it, then the regulators will take a big hit in their hard-nosed approach.This could actually be a defining moment for regulation that will either lead to blanket bans popping up all over or it could force the governments to come off their high horses and accept and integrate Bitcoin and others.",45,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #ICO  
Cryptocurrency Regulation ‘Not High On To-Do List’ Says European Central Bank,William Suberg,2/7/2018 14:33,31861,866,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has moderated its stance on cryptocurrency regulation Wednesday, Feb. 7, describing it as “not exactly very high on its to-do list” in a brief interview with CNBC.The ECB’s Chair of the Supervisory Board Daniele Nouy added that although she had “no clue” whether new regulatory moves on crypto would come from Europe in the future, involvement of ECB-regulated banks in the sphere was “very, very low”.“We scrutinize the issue in a regulatory perspective, we are ready to do something if it was needed, but so far it's not exactly very high on our to-do list,” she told the network.The comment come ahead of an increasingly-anticipated G20 Summit this coming March in Argentina, where cryptocurrency regulation will form a major topic of discussion, according to a growing number of sources, including the ECB.During last month’s World Economic Forum (WEF), board member Benoit Coeure said he “expected” the international community to “focus very much on” the issue at the upcoming event in Buenos Aires.Despite the calls for an international regulatory effort on crypto spearheaded notably by French economy minister Bruno Le Maire in December, Europe’s umbrella bureaucracy appears less interested in direct intervention of its own.“We are not observing a systematically relevant holding of digital currencies by supervised institutions,” ECB president Mario Draghi told the European Parliament in Strasbourg Monday, quoted in various news outlets.

"South Korean Crypto Exchange Halts Trading, Unable To Comply With New Regulations",Helen Partz,2/7/2018 9:01,42383,337,"South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinpia has suspended fiat deposits as well as trading operations after the company was not able to meet the country’s new KYC requirements in time, as stated in an announcement on their site Tuesday, Feb. 6.The new, stricter anti money laundering regulations in South Korea were first announced in late December and  took effect on Jan. 30.

Coinpia’s decision to halt trading came “[i]n the absence of a clear solution”, as the company had not been able to set up the necessary systems for user verification with banks in time.As Cointelegraph reported last week, the day after the KYC law went into effect, the Korea Customs Service (KCS) published a press release that revealed that more than $600 mln in digital currency had been traded under the new law.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Tradings  
Brave New World for Cryptocurrency Regulation: Expert Take,Guest Author,2/6/2018 18:20,42909,285,"In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation, and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to a.mcqueen@cointelegraph.com.Make a note on your calendars - January 2018 was when it all changed. The freewheeling world of cryptocurrency ran headlong into an intractable wall of US regulators.Not that there weren’t hints of regulatory action in the air. The Securities and Exchange Commission had already shut down two initial coin offerings (ICOs) in December and rolled out a cyber unit with ICOs under its purview, but regulators put down their marker and turned the heat on full blast last month.A Wall Street Journal op-ed by SEC Chair Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo put the industry on notice and that was only the beginning.On Jan. 30, the SEC halted another ICO, the third in the last two months. Separate reports found the CFTC has issued subpoenas to one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, created a “heightened review” process for virtual currencies, and charged a cryptocurrency for allegedly scamming investors out of $6 mln.And, possibly in response to the op-ed, or maybe the half-billion-dollar digital coin theft from a Japanese exchange, Facebook announced it would ban all ads promoting cryptocurrency.On Tuesday Feb. 6 the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs held a hearing exclusively devoted to virtual currencies with Clayton and Giancarlo as the sole witnesses.“The message is getting through that this is not off the grid,” Giancarlo told the committee. “Now you are seeing it in the Bitcoin prices as word is getting out that we will go after misconduct.”For an industry that has seen explosive growth, but largely avoided regulation, these moves come as a sea change.The industry topped $700 bln in January, and one analyst projected it has a “longer term” potential of $10 tln. But regulatory scrutiny could dampen that growth.As the op-ed noted, “The SEC will vigorously pursue those who seek to evade the registration, disclosure and anti-fraud requirements of our securities laws.” And all participants in the industry are being closely monitored, including “broker-dealers, investment advisers and trading platforms.”These warnings ensure a windfall for the legal community that has already dabbled in the cryptocurrency industry. Several large firms have practices focused on Blockchain and digital coins, but others will soon follow, and the practices will only grow and become more sophisticated.In this new era, small upstart cryptocurrency players, without the capital for proper due diligence, will likely fold or never make it to market in the first place. And the major players will look to secure their position and reach a broader audience, retaining the legal firepower necessary to win regulators’ blessing.Cryptocurrency providers now must be able to go a step further in telling their stories and reach a broader investor base. This includes engaging the media to succinctly explain how their products work, what their value is and what legal due diligence is backing them. In doing so, they can tout their compliance process and continued oversight, and even cite the high-profile law firm doing the work.Ultimately, the cryptocurrency industry has some difficult labels to overcome, like “scam” and “fraud,” not to mention the recent statements by regulators.Last year was marked by unprecedented growth for the industry, but 2018 will usher in a new era of due diligence and transparency. With the start of the year, the SEC and CFTC essentially forced the digital coin companies’ hand.As Clayton and Giancarlo noted in their op-ed: “Market participants, including lawyers, trading venues, and financial services firms, should be aware that we are disturbed by many examples of form being elevated over substance, with form-based arguments depriving investors of mandatory protections.”Now cryptocurrency companies must act or risk becoming regulators’ next victim.The views expressed here are the author’s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com.Matthew BeatonMatthew Beaton leads the New York-based public relations firm Beaton PR, which works with law and financial services firms.

General Manager of BIS Wants To Prevent Crypto From Joining ‘Main Financial System’,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/6/2018 16:39,36184,458,"Augustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), called Bitcoin a “combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster”  and asked central banks to more closely regulate cryptocurrencies during a speech at Goethe University on Feb. 6.BIS is known as the “bank for central banks,” for it only provides banking services to central banks and other international organizations.In August 2017, when Carstens was the head of the central Bank of Mexico, he argued that Bitcoin is not a currency but a commodity and warned against its potential use for cybercrime.Carsten’s recent comments Tuesday morning come after both the traditional and crypto markets have been experiencing a large drop since Monday, Feb. 5. Also this week, several large banks, including Lloyds Banking Group and J.P. Morgan Chase, banned credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies.In Carsten’s opinion, the global interest in cryptocurrencies is just a “speculative mania” and thus strict regulation by central banks is needed:“If authorities do not act pre-emptively, cryptocurrencies could become more interconnected with the main financial system and become a threat to financial stability.”Carsten considers it “alarming” that some banks are releasing Bitcoin ATMs, for he considers Bitcoin’s potential use for illegal transactions too high to allow the currency to be associated with mainstream financial institutions:“If the only ‘business case’ is use for illicit or illegal transactions, central banks cannot allow such tokens to rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system and freeload on the trust that it provides.”The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and Elliptic, a Bitcoin forensics company, released a report in late January that showed that less than one percent of all Bitcoin transactions represented money laundering.",42,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Central Bank

As of now, there is no strong case to ban cryptocurrency trading here,” the deputy PM said.“But we will be subjecting those involved as intermediaries to our anti-money laundering regulations. And we will keep highlighting to Singaporeans that they could lose their shirts when they invest money in cryptocurrencies.”Like Japan, Singapore has highlighted itself as a permissive environment for both cryptocurrency and Blockchain innovation over the past few years.In stark contrast to China and Indonesia, the city-state has favored Blockchain in particular as part of its bid to become a global hub for the technology.Addressing the disparity between Singapore and its neighbors, Shanmugaratnam noted that volumes involved were comparatively small and exposure to the financial system correspondingly insignificant.“For now, the nature and scale of cryptocurrency trading in Singapore does not pose risks to the safety and integrity of our financial system,” he continued.“...Further, connections between cryptocurrency trading and Singapore’s financial system are also not significant at present. Singapore’s banking system does not have any signficant (sic) exposure to global and local entities dealing in cryptocurrencies. We hence do not have broader, systemic risk concerns with regard to cryptocurrencies.”Last month, MAS managing director Ravi Menon sounded similarly bullish on crypto’s future when he went on record to mainstream media to say he hoped assets and their underlying technology would survive a major crash.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Singapore    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government

My colleagues said here that cryptocurrencies can be used for payment. Let’s approach this carefully, because our economies are so strongly and closely linked.”In March of 2017, Medvedev had called for the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Economic Growth to begin research into the potential uses of Blockchain in government.More recently at the Gaidar Forum held in January, Medvedev criticized cryptocurrencies as an economic bubble that will eventually disappear, although he said that Blockchain technology will remain.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia

Among those exempted are the carve-outs cover law enforcement officials, merchants who use DLT or similar technology in reporting sales to the state government, and firearm owners who have issued a written authorization for the Blockchain-based monitoring of their guns.Part of the bill titled “Imposes Restrictions on the Use of Firearm Tracking Technology” read:""It shall be unlawful to require a person to use or be subject to electronic firearm tracking technology or to disclose any identifiable information about the person or the person's firearm for the purpose of using electronic firearm tracking technology.""Schroer also proposes in his bill that anyone who is found guilty of unlawfully tracking firearms using Blockchain technology may be held liable for a Class E felony.According to law firm Carver Cantin Mynarich, LLC, class E felonies are the least severe of the felonies stated in the state’s statutes and guilty violators can face a jail time of up to four years. Some examples of class E felonies are motor fuel tax evasion, and possession of stolen and fraudulent certificates, records or reports.The bill also differentiates electronic firearm tracking technologies against the official law enforcement tracking systems such as the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES) database. Electronic firearm tracking technologies refer to DLTs or other decentralized databases.The proposed legislation is almost identical to the one signed into law by the Arizona government in February 2017.In general, US politicians are still debating as to how to best regulate Blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the country while Senate has recently moved to consider non-disclosure of cryptocurrency holdings illegal.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Missouri    #USA    #Government  
British Treasury Plans to Implement EU-Wide Cryptocurrency Regulation by Late 2018,Joshua Althauser,12/7/2017 13:19,20992,0,"The British Treasury plans to introduce regulations that will cover Bitcoin and other digital currencies in late 2018. The agency is increasingly concerned about the possibility that the virtual currencies could be used in illegal activities like money laundering and tax evasion due to their growing popularity.Under the planned legislation that is intended to cover the entire European Union (EU), cryptocurrency traders will be compelled to disclose their identities and report any suspicious activity that they may discover in virtual currency trading.This move by the UK government could cause confusion among industry players as the majority of f exchanges in the country are already compliant with the existing know your customer (KML) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws.The proposed regulation could be implemented by the British government immediately because of the booming digital currency market in the country. The continuous increase in their prices in the market, particularly Bitcoin, which has attracted a lot of people, who could be enticed to invest in the tokens due to their surging prices.The absence of regulations in place to regulate the trading and use of the digital currencies can put the money that will be invested by the people at very high risk.According to a spokesperson from the British Treasury, the new cryptocurrency regulation could be implemented by the end of 2018. This tentative date could still be changed, however, and the specific details of the proposed regulations are not yet determined as of the moment.It is also expected that more digital currency-related laws will be introduced by different countries in the EU in the near future.

The South Korean government seems to be struggling to understand these currencies which are unlike anything else in the financial world. Recently, South Korea has announced its plans to begin regulating digital currency exchanges and taxing cryptocurrency profits. The country has also banned initial coin offerings (ICOs).Citizens of the Asian nation have been aggressive buyers of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, often paying substantial premiums over the price on Western exchanges. Tony Lyu, CEO of South Korean exchange Korbit, explained:“Word just spreads really fast in Korea. Once people are invested, they want everyone else to join the party.

Regulators Could Start Stirring Again if Bitcoin Continues Rising: Mike Novogratz,Darryn Pollock,12/6/2017 13:35,18772,0,"Since China, Russia, and a few others cracked down hard on Bitcoin, it has been relatively quiet on the regulations front as Bitcoin has continued to soar unbridled. However, the head scratching on how to regulate continues.The next fear, for Former Fortress Hedge Fund Manager Michael Novogratz, is that Bitcoin’s continued rise and prominence in the mainstream media could reawaken the regulation beast.However, Novogratz still feels that Bitcoin is difficult to regulate and it will be hard for governments to make an impact immediately.Novogratz, who has been outspoken on Bitcoin for some time now, claiming it could be a bubble, but one to profit from has his concerns now.""I've got concerns that if price movements go higher, we're going to get more regulation,"" Novogratz said. “But I think it's hard to shut down. ... I don't think that's a probability.""""One of the big risks out there right now is that prices are moving so fast that regulators are going to get nervous,"" he added. ""I could legitimately see Bitcoin go $13,000, $14,000, $20,000, $25,000 and see somebody balk.""Bitcoin’s rise, while roundly celebrated by all involved, has also made many stop and wonder how or when this will all end. Will it pop, come crashing down, continue or get stamped out. It has become a scary upride.With regulators failing to slow it the first time, there could be an even heavier blow coming that could perhaps cause some derailing. However, before that happens, it is important to understand what is making it hit such heights.Novogratz adds:""We're in a speculative frenzy. Period. Stop. How long can it go? Who knows,"" Novogratz said. ""What's interesting about this is it's global.""Another reason that Bitcoin has hit such heights must also be attributed to it finding its identity. Many were scratching their heads as to what Bitcoin is - a currency or an asset - but recent changes have set it straight.""Bitcoin is winning out as digital gold,"" Novogratz explained.

Swedish Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund Bigger Than 80% of US ETFs,Joseph Young,12/6/2017 12:02,44199,0,"According to Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, Sweden’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETN) is bigger than around 80 percent of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Dude: Sweden's bitcoin ETN is now bigger and trades more than about 80% of US ETFs. It hit $700m in aum today while trading $220m this week (insane #s for Sweden).. #BTC pic.twitter.com/dErGC3xtfxXBT Provider, the Bitcoin ETN listed on Nordic Nasdaq, a major Swedish stock exchange, is currently one of the three methods of investing in Bitcoin through a strictly regulated market, apart from Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin Investment Fund (GBTC) and LedgerX’s US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-approved Bitcoin derivatives, options and futures exchange.Earlier this year, billionaire investor and the owner of NBA’s Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban revealed at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles that he officially invested in Bitcoin through XBT Provider in Sweden.“It is interesting because there are a lot of assets which their value is just based on supply and demand. Most stocks, there is no intrinsic value because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. Bitcoin is the same thing. Its value is based on supply demand. I have bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange,” said Cuban.In September, immediately after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon offered baseless condemnation on Bitcoin, it was revealed that JPMorgan Securities traded Bitcoin on behalf of its clients through custodian accounts on the Nordic Nasdaq, using the XBT Provider Bitcoin ETN.High profile investors such as Cuban and large-scale investment firms are restricted to invest through strictly regulated stock markets and investment platforms. Hence, while it is possible for Cuban and other major investors to purchase Bitcoin with personal savings on Bitcoin brokers and exchanges, with a large portfolio, it is difficult to invest directly in Bitcoin.Several leading Bitcoin brokerages including the $1.6 bln company Coinbase introduced platforms targeted at institutional and retail investors. Coinbase Custody for instance, enables investors to allocate at least $10 mln into Bitcoin. As Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote:“Coinbase Custody is only available to institutional investors with a minimum of $10 mln in deposits. Retail customers can utilize Coinbase.com as a custody solution.”Armstrong added that Coinbase already stores billions of dollars worth of digital assets on behalf of the firm’s clients and retail traders.“We already store billions of dollars worth of digital assets on behalf of our customers. We serve thousands of institutions via our GDAX product, the leading digital currency exchange in the US,” said Armstrong, adding that around $10 bln in institutional money is awaiting to be invested in Bitcoin. “By some estimates, there is $10 bln of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to invest in digital currency today.”Upon the launch of Bitcoin futures exchanges by CBOE and CME, two of the largest options exchanges in the global finance market, the volume of regulated Bitcoin investment instruments such as ETNs on Nordic Nasdaq and GBTC will spike, as demand from the traditional finance market surges over time.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Tradings    #ETF    #USA    #Sweden    #Investments  
"PBoC Governor Believes Bitcoin Will Die, But Chinese Market Disagrees",Joseph Young,12/5/2017 4:30,24021,0,"Pan Gongsheng, a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, told Sina in an interview that he believes Bitcoin will decline in the long-term.“As Keynes has taught us, ‘the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.’ There is only one thing left to do: Sit by the river bank and see Bitcoin’s body pass by one day.”He further emphasized that the PBoC and local Chinese authorities have made the right decision to suspend cryptocurrency trading. Gongsheng stated:""If we had not shut down Bitcoin exchanges and cracked down on ICOs several months ago, if China still accounted for more than 80% of the world’s Bitcoin trading and ICO fundraising...what would happen today? Thinking of this question makes me scared.""China’s 90 percent global Bitcoin market share figure mentioned by Gongsheng was refuted by many analysts, investors, and researchers in the cryptocurrency sector as early as last year. For many years the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market and trading platforms within used a zero-fee trading system. All trades were completely free, with no fees at all.A crucial issue with zero-fee exchanges is their vulnerability to bot and wash trading, which can lead to large inflated volumes. Hence, the actual trading volume of a market with zero-fee exchanges is likely to be a fraction of what it seems.In December of 2016, the PBoC requested all Chinese trading platforms and exchanges to eliminate zero-fee trading. Almost immediately, the supposed 90 percent Bitcoin exchange market share of the Chinese market sharply dropped to seven percent. China was never the largest Bitcoin market, but rather the fifth largest market behind Japan, the US, South Korea and Europe.Moreover, if China had accounted for a major portion of the global Bitcoin exchange market, its crackdown on cryptocurrency trading would have had a bigger impact on the price of Bitcoin. However, since China’s ban on cryptocurrency trading, Bitcoin has increased in value from $5,000 to $11,665.BitcoinPriceTrend_Cointelegraph_12.5.2017As Leonhard Weese, the founder of Bitcoin Association of HK and tech-columnist noted, China’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges migrated to the Hong Kong Bitcoin market after the Chinese government’s crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges.Weese revealed that Huobi, OKCoin, BTCC (which operate as Huobi Pro) and OKEx now account for seven percent of global Bitcoin trades. In China, investors are purchasing Bitcoin with a high premium of around eight percent. Weese explained that most investors utilize offshore banking accounts to trade in Hong Kong:“In Hong Kong, four dedicated OTC trading desks, Gatecoin, Octagon Strategy, Circle Trading and Genesis Block now compete for orders that can range between 1 and 10,000 BTC.”",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Investments    #Markets    #Tradings    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China    #ICO  
"Crackdown On Bitcoin In UK Over Money Laundering, Tax Evasion",Jon Buck,12/4/2017 15:45,27727,249,"The Treasury of the UK has announced plans to strongly regulate the transfer of cryptocurrencies with a view to cracking down on money laundering and tax evasion. The regulations have not been stipulated with specificity, but will certainly include anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) details.The regulation is intended to take force before the end of 2017, or just at the beginning of 2018. The increased regulations, in line with the directives in the EU, are intended to limit the amount of anonymity possible for cryptocurrency traders. According to John Mann, one of the Treasury committee:""These new forms of exchange are expanding rapidly and we've got to make sure we don't get left behind - that's particularly important in terms of money-laundering, terrorism or pure theft. I'm not convinced that the regulatory authorities are keeping up to speed. I would be surprised if the committee doesn't have an inquiry next year. It would be timely to have a proper look at what this means. It may be that we want to speed up our use of these kinds of thing in this country, but that makes it all the more important that we don't have a regulatory lag.”Other regulations have been threatened around the world, as Bitcoin price soars. With adoption exploding, and massive influx of institutional capital via futures and other contracts, Bitcoin is becoming far more of a financial reality that it has ever been before.

Japanese Financial Regulator Legalizes Four New Cryptocurrency Exchanges,Joshua Althauser,12/4/2017 14:20,28079,245,"Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has authorized the operation of four new virtual currency exchanges in the country as of early December 2017. The approved exchanges are already the second batch of companies authorized by the FSA. In late September, the agency has okayed the applications of the first batch of applicants consisting of 11 exchanges.   In its statement posted on its website, the FSA claimed that only the authorized 15 exchanges should be allowed to trade digital currencies as only the cryptocurrencies that they will handle are confirmed to “meet the definition under the fund settlement law.” The four companies that were approved are Tokyo Bitcoin Exchange Co. Ltd., FTT Corp., Bit Arg Exchange Tokyo Co. Ltd., and Xtheta Corp.Of the four companies, only Xtheta Corp. was authorized to trade multiple cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), NEM (XEM), and Monacoin (MONA), as well as counterparty tokens (XCP). The rest of the exchanges are only allowed to trade Bitcoin (BTC).According to the FSA, other applications are still undergoing evaluation. There were also 12 companies whose applications were rejected because they did not meet the agency’s registration requirements. The disapproved exchanges have already shut down their operations.Among the applications under review is from Coincheck, which is the second biggest Bitcoin exchange in Japan. In its statement that was released on Dec. 1, the exchange claimed that its application to become a “virtual currency exchange trader” was filed in mid-September and is still under scrutiny until now.Meanwhile, the FSA released a document detailing its administrative policies that include those covering virtual currencies and initial coin offerings (ICO) in November.

South Korean Financial Authorities Plan to Regulate Bitcoin Exchanges Soon,Joseph Young,12/4/2017 11:21,15618,268,"Unverified rumors on the South Korean government’s potential crackdown on cryptocurrency trading circulated around online Bitcoin communities over the past few days.Currently, the South Korean government remains highly optimistic in regards to the growth of the local Bitcoin industry and has recently announced its plans to introduce a nationwide regulatory framework for Bitcoin exchanges and brokerages.As Cointelegraph reported, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon announced that the government is actively investigating into methods of providing local cryptocurrency and Bitcoin investors with consumer protection, implementing stricter Know your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies, and protecting customer assets.The South Korean government does not intend to crack down on any aspect or area of the Bitcoin market because the enforcement of impractical policies can lead to the migration of investors and their funds into unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) markets, which are significantly more challenging for the government to oversee.Hence, there is no truth to any of the rumors circulating around online Bitcoin communities and forums that the South Korean government will crackdown on Bitcoin trading. Just last week, South Korea’s ministry of finance and strategy revealed that it has already begun the process of drafting various regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges.One of the many policies the government may implement is the prevention of trading volume centralization into a few exchanges. At the time of reporting, Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone account for over 90 percent of the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market share, with Bithumb processing more trades on a daily basis than the country’s largest stock market KOSDAQ.“The South Korean ministry of finance and strategy have drafted taxation policies on Bitcoin trading. But, regulatory frameworks around Bitcoin taxation will not be implemented in the 2018 amendment of the tax law,” said South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Kim Dong-yeon.Some of the leading financial institutions within the South Korean traditional finance market are already preparing to adopt and integrate Bitcoin. Most notably, Shinhan, the second largest commercial bank in the country, has developed and tested a Bitcoin wallet and vault service.A Shinhan spokesperson explained that the bank intends to provide a secure and insured platform in which customers of South Korean Bitcoin exchanges can store their funds in, given that Bithumb, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was hacked twice this year.Currently, according to cryptocurrency market data provider CryptoCompare, the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market accounts for nearly seven percent of the global Bitcoin market share.

South Korea Is Investigating Methods to Tax Bitcoin Users,Joseph Young,12/3/2017 16:25,28034,422,"Kim Dong-yeon, South Korea’s deputy prime minister and the minister of strategy and finance, revealed earlier this week that the government is investigating various methods to better regulate the local Bitcoin market and tax Bitcoin users accordingly.While the South Korean government and its local financial authorities are actively discussing the possibility of enforcing a policy on Bitcoin taxation, at a press conference, Deputy Prime Minister Kim stated that the government does not intend to include any Bitcoin taxation policy in 2018’s amendment of the tax law.Since the beginning of this year, the South Korean government has introduced light regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin businesses and investors that are structurally similar to that of the policies imposed by the Japanese government and the Japan Financial Service Agency (FSA).Currently, cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms have the freedom to operate in both regions, with minimal government interference and oversight.As a part of a major initiative to facilitate the growth of the Japanese cryptocurrency market, the Japanese government eliminated the eight percent consumption tax on Bitcoin in July, with the intent of sustaining the rapid growth rate of the Japanese Bitcoin industry and growing demand from the traditional finance sector.It is likely that the South Korean government will implement a similar Bitcoin tax policy to that of the Japanese government, given that most of the regulatory frameworks provided by the South Korean financial authorities in 2017 focused on providing freedom and flexibility to businesses, like Japan.Several agencies, Bitcoin communities, and government officials have expressed their concerns with the centralization of trading within South Korea. Bithumb, South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency trading platform behind Bitfinex, accounts for nearly 70 percent of South Korea’s Bitcoin trades.South Korea’s Ministry of Strategy and Finance will explore potential methods of distributing cryptocurrency and Bitcoin trading volumes across a wider range of cryptocurrency trading platforms within the market.Additionally, some of the country’s largest and most influential financial institutions such as Shinhan, South Korea’s second-largest commercial bank, have already begun testing Bitcoin wallet and vault systems, with a long-term strategy to provide a safe and insured platform with which Bitcoin users can store funds.Shinhan emphasized that a vault service for Bitcoin users, especially large-scale investment firms and institutional investors, is necessary, given that Bithumb was hacked twice this year.However, it is also important to consider the structure of the Bitcoin network and its decentralized nature. Because the Bitcoin network exists on a peer-to-peer protocol, the safest way to store Bitcoin is on non-custodial wallet platforms, wherein the user obtains absolute control of private keys and funds.Overall, it is highly optimistic that the South Korean government has started to acknowledge the rapid growth rate of Bitcoin and drafted several solutions to standardize the South Korean Bitcoin industry.",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Taxes    #Investments    #Tradings    #Banks

Quarles made it clear that the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) position on cryptocurrencies is one of extreme caution. Instead, Quarles suggests that the government partner with current banking systems to create solutions in response to the digital payment wave.The warning came as the regulator considered the possible implications of digital currencies during times of crisis. Recalling runs on major banks, and the reasons for founding the Federal Reserve, Quarles made it clear that the lack of supervision over cryptocurrencies should destabilize financial institutions. He said:“While these digital currencies may not pose major concerns at their current levels of use, more serious financial stability issues may result if they achieve wide-scale usage. Risk management can act as a mitigant, but if the central asset in a payment system cannot be predictably redeemed for the US dollar at a stable exchange rate in times of adversity, the resulting price risk and potential liquidity and credit risk pose a large challenge for the system.”Beyond just warning on decentralized digital currencies, the supervisor made clear that he would strongly caution against a governmental digital currency as well, noting that, should many users shift to such decentralized systems, banks may lose the necessary liquidity to loan money, make payments, etc.Instead, he indicated that payment structures within the banking system have improved greatly from a technological perspective. Further, as the banks continue to seek out new innovation for improving payment methodology, the Fed would continue to partner with them to produce stability and safety. He said:“Working cooperatively, private-sector participants and central banks can incorporate innovation that may be able to strike the right balance of improving the technical networks without adversely generating financial stability concerns.”",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Federal Reserve

We expect buys and sells to be offline for 1-2 hours. Customers can still access their accounts, deposit and withdraw.As USD rates fluctuated by thousands of dollars over the past 48 hours, the exchange saw its servers go offline as it failed to cope with demand.

South Korean Regulators To Release Crypto Tax Framework By June,Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/1/2018 12:25,23571,508,"South Korea’s Ministry of Strategy and Finance will reportedly release a taxation framework for cryptocurrencies by the end of June, local news outlet Fuji News Network (FNN) reported March 25.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said that although they “do not have a specific time frame,” they are “thinking about announcing a virtual money tax in the first half of the year,” and FNN adds that any taxation would only start next year.The announcement of the future tax plan came after the Finance Ministers' meeting of the G20 that took place earlier this month from March 19-20.In December of last year, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance said that the country was looking into taxation methods for the local Bitcoin (BTC) market. More recently, in January, South Korea announced that cryptocurrency exchanges will be taxed in line with the existing tax policy, a 22 percent corporate tax and a 2.2 percent local income tax.The South Korean government’s crypto tax task force has proposed a “transfer income tax that levies taxes on profits” made from crypto sales, FNN writes, adding that “If income from virtual currency transactions is considered temporary and irregular, other income taxes may be imposed.”South Korea’s Ministry of Taxation has looked internationally for examples in crypto taxation, sending employees to the US, Japan, Germany, and the UK for surveys of their varying crypto tax frameworks.

"China’s New Central Bank Head Is Pro-Market, Could It Impact Cryptocurrency Industry?",Joseph Young,4/1/2018 8:35,33503,503,"Yi Gang, an American-trained economist, has been elected by the Chinese government to take over the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country’s central bank, as its head. The election of a pro-market economist could have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency market.Both Chinese President Xi Jinping and PBoC’s new leader Yi Gang are pro-market and pro-market reform. Prior to his election, Yi has consistently emphasized the importance of market liberalization, and has invited economists along with experienced financial experts who could support his long-term plan to increase the flexibility of the Chinese market.Already, within weeks since the election of Yi, the Chinese government has, for the first time, allowed foreign companies to enter the country’s payment sector and compete against local giants like e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba’s AliPay and the country’s largest technology corporation Tencent’s Tencent Pay.For context, China’s Tencent, which has made a series of successful acquisitions over the past few years including Riot Games, the game development company behind one of the most popular online games – League of Legends (LOL), surpassed the market valuation of Facebook in November 2017. Tencent became the first Asian company to break the $500 bln mark, and outdistanced Facebook prior to its Cambridge Analytica Scandal, which led Facebook to decline by nearly $70 bln drop from $517 bln to $445 bln.In 2016, it was revealed that more viewers watched LOL, the game developed by Riot Games under Tencent, than the NBA finals. LOL’s professional esports league finals were hosted in the Beijing National Stadium, also known as Bird’s Nest, which has a capacity of 91,000 people. The NBA finals were watched by 31 mln people worldwide, while the LOL finals were watched by 36 mln people internationally.The success of Tencent and its dominance over the global esports industry as well as social media, messaging, and payment markets is important to acknowledge because for the first time in its history, the Chinese government has given the company competition in the finance sector.On March 21, Bloomberg reported that the Chinese government has officially opened the gates of its $27 trln payments market to foreign companies, and has allowed companies to apply for licenses. Iris Pang, a Hong Kong-based economist at ING Groep NV, told Bloomberg:“The domestic market is quite saturated with very strong domestic players, and it is relatively hard for foreign companies to get a piece of the pie. But there is a chance for them to compete in the cross-border payment market.”In other markets like social media, search engines, and messaging, the Chinese government has banned conglomerates like Facebook and Google from operating within the country for various reasons, but mainly to ensure that domestic platforms such as QQ and YouKu can take control over the entire market with 100 percent of the market share.The move of the Chinese government and the PBoC to allow foreign companies into its payment sector was unprecedented, and such a positive movement towards market liberalization could inevitably lead to speculations around the cryptocurrency market and its stance towards it.In Sept. 2017, almost immediately after the PBoC and the Chinese government imposed a strict ban on cryptocurrency trading, analyst Jon Creasy explained that the PBoC has taken such path to support the political narrative of President Xi. Creasy said that the government will likely open its cryptocurrency market once President Xi establishes his government again:“Historically speaking, President Xi Jinping has been one of the largest advocates of free markets China has seen in quite some time, and I expect this trend to continue. But for now, Mr. Xi must appeal to the people who keep him in power: the Communist Party. In my opinion, banning Bitcoin exchanges is nothing short of temporary glad-handing. Supposing this is true, what should we be doing about it?”So far, the Chinese government and President Xi have demonstrated willingness to continue their plans to liberalize the Chinese market, starting with its payment sector that is largely dominated by domestic companies.The next target market for the Chinese government could be the cryptocurrency market, given that the Chinese government has not led additional initiatives to shut down cryptocurrency activities and projects within China. Blockchain projects from China such as VeChain and NEO are still able to continue their developments, because the Chinese government had banned the trading of cryptocurrencies, but not storing or holding them.VeChain, NEO, and Qtum are all multi-billion dollar projects established and developed by teams located in China. In fact, the three cryptocurrencies are some of the largest cryptocurrencies in the global market, with NEO being the 9th biggest in the market with a $3.7 bln valuation.Cryptweeter, a well-known cryptocurrency researcher, stated that state-owned media outlets including Yicai have offered extensive coverage of VeChain, a Blockchain project and cryptocurrency based in China:“They have started to be picked up by mainstream media in China, most notably Yicai, who have been seen tweeting and retweeting a lot about VeChain recently. Yicai are state-owned and are one of the leading financial news and investment outlets in the country.”Given the government’s support towards native Blockchain projects and initiatives, and the election of pro-market economists like the new PBoC head Yi, it could be likely that some pro-Blockchain legislation will be released in the mid to long-term.Although the Chinese government has banned cryptocurrency trading, it is highly unlikely that this will continue to be the case, especially if PBoC head Yi continues his long-term initiative to liberalize the Chinese markets and its leading industries, like the payments and finance sectors.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #PBoC    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tradings    #Ethereum News    #NEO  
"Kazakh National Bank Considers Ban Of Crypto Trading, Mining In The Country",Molly Jane Zuckerman,4/1/2018 8:14,19369,254,"Kazakhstan’s National Bank is considering banning exchanges of cryptocurrency for the national currency, the tenge, as well as crypto mining, local news outlet Sputnik reported March 30.Daniyar Akishev, the chairman of the National Bank, said that they are “taking a very conservative approach toward the matter, and it welcomes nothing but extremely tough restrictions”, stating:“Therefore, we want to ban the exchange of digital currencies for the national currency. We want to prohibit the stock exchange’s activities in this area, as well as every type of mining.”According to Akishev, the problem with cryptocurrencies is their lack of regulation and characteristics as an “ideal instrument for money laundering and tax evasion:”""We minimize the risks related to the national market. However, no central bank has all the instruments to control this market in the cross-border market. Therefore, at least, we must prevent this risk via the national currency.”Akishev told Sputnik that the “majority” of Kazakhstan governmental organization endorse this strict attitude.Last fall, Kazakhstan showed more support for the possibility of cryptocurrencies and crypto technologies, as government-supported Astana International Finance Center (AIFC) announced that they were working on creating their own cryptocurrency, the CryptoTenge. In November, Kazakhstan’s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association also applied with the government to be allowed to begin conducting official activities.In early March, a study by search engine Yandex showed that Kazakhstanis were looking up cryptocurrency-related terms in more frequency this year than in 2017.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Kazakhstan    #Mining    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Yandex    #Money Laundering  
Japan: Operator Of GMO Exchange Promises To Improve Data Security After Regulator Order,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/31/2018 15:05,20061,223,"GMO Internet, the operator of Japanese crypto exchange GMO Coin, has announced the establishment of a “Group Information Security Audit Office” in order to develop stronger security measures to protect customer information, according to a March 30 press release.GMO Coin was one of the crypto exchanges that was sent a business improvement order by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) after a series of on-site inspections prompted by the January hack of crypto exchange Coincheck.GMO Internet’s new group, run by “knowledgeable security expert” Takeshi Miyazaki, will include an external advisor on security as well. The establishment of this group aims to “protect important customer information from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks by our highly secured countermeasures and pursue to improve group information security literacy and foster security personnel.”A little over a week ago, on March 22, GMO Coin posted on their website that they had submitted their FSA-requested business improvement plan to the Kanto Local Finance Bureau.GMO Coin added that they “sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and worry that our customers and stakeholders have incurred”, adding that:“We deeply reflect on taking this administrative punishment seriously [...] and steadily improve the system risk management system by implementing [an] improvemen[t] plan, so that we can offer service[s] [so] that customers can feel secure and safe.”GMO Internet is also involved in crypto mining, having announced in September of last year that they planned on cornering 6 percent of the Bitcoin (BTC) mining market in 2018.In the wake of the stricter regulatory supervision in Japan, two crypto exchanges decided to shut down earlier this week rather than work with regulators for compliance.

France and Germany: How Regulatory Traditions in Two Countries Could Affect EU Legislation,Kirill Bryanov,3/30/2018 20:05,17961,264,"The first meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors this year was anticipated by the crypto community after a series of separate words and deeds on regulation among the world’s biggest players. But no joint framework declarations followed the meeting. With the Financial Stability Board’s cautious statements casting chill over individual members’ enthusiasm to discuss crypto matters, all that came out of the summit was merely a bunch of baby steps in the anticipated direction. Now again, the community is left to do what it has been doing all along: interpreting subtle cues and contradictory signals that emanate from policymakers representing individual nation-states.France, one of the vocal proponents of cryptocurrency regulation at the G20 level, has been a major hotbed for contradictory signals lately. In a recent about-face, French regulators unveiled a set of new initial coin offering (ICO) rules that look extremely lenient towards both entrepreneurs and investors. The development came across as utterly unexpected, especially given the fact that merely days before the announcement the same regulatory agency cracked down on 15 crypto-related websites for unlawfully marketing investment services.Germany is another European powerhouse spotted proposing a unified approach to crypto regulation earlier this year. Much like its neighbor, Germany seems to be swinging its view, though in a less dramatic way. Having issued a series of warnings regarding the speculative character of cryptocurrency trading and ICO investments last November, German authorities now clarifying some of their stances and issuing promising winks.As the European Union’s dominant powers, this duo will likely lead the way in crafting any potential bloc-wide standards for governing Blockchain and the wealth of its applications. Despite stark distinctions in the way their legal systems and regulatory regimes operate, in recent decades France and Germany have exhibited quite a few common patterns in handling new regulatory challenges brought about by the rise of internet industries.From limiting online speech to protecting user data to levying taxes on tech giants, both have demonstrated a tremendous appetite for asserting their sovereignty over the online realm. Presuming that the spirit of broader internet governance is highly likely to carry over to Blockchain regulation, a closer look at the already established patterns is useful for envisioning what the imminent cryptocurrency related policies might look like.One thing to remember about continental Europe is that historically the role of the state and centralized bureaucracy has been greater than those in common law-based Anglo-Saxon systems. The tradition of statutory law along with corporatist political culture prescribed not just an overall embrace, but expectation of an active regulatory involvement on behalf of the state in the most important spheres of domestic policy. Both states have certainly lived up to these expectations.The French government has been directly managing communication networks since the very early stages of their mass expansion. The first network to connect vast numbers of French people was not the internet but rather the homegrown and highly centralized Minitel. Once the functional superiority of the global network became evident to the government, it took measures to boost internet adoption – again, via a state program. Content blocking requirements are embedded into the legislation, and it is internet service providers (ISPs) that are held liable for violations. ISPs do engage in some degree of self-regulation, but usually a governmental response precedes any self-imposed restrictions. Blocking is amply used to enforce copyright and prevent illicit activities such as unlicensed gambling or the distribution of content depicting child abuse.A vastly different set of domestic rules and practices is in place in the German system, where the idea of “regulated self-regulation” took hold. At least in part, it emerged as an unintended consequence of German federalism: while the debate as to whether policing web content should be a prerogative of national or federal authorities dragged for years, ISPs were able to use this time to put together a working system of industry associations. A part of this system is a self-regulatory authority that partners directly with search engines. As a result, no direct blocking exists, since filtering of content happens on the stage of indexing. ISP’s are not held liable for illegal content that travels through their pipes. Communication industries command a powerful network of organized interests that is strongly opposed to censorship.Both France and Germany have embraced a similarly aggressive stance in policing some forms of online expression. French law criminalizes racist and anti-Semitic speech both offline and online; each new government routinely puts forward a new comprehensive state program to fight hate in the public sphere. State officials’ faith in power of direct content regulation seems to be unfailing: for one, President Emmanuel Macron pledged in January to roll out an anti-fake news law by the end of 2018.   The German legislative quest against hate speech culminated in the 2017 “Facebook law,” which imposed heavy penalties on social media platforms for failing to quickly remove illegal content from public view. Facebook and Twitter responded by fielding record numbers of German-speaking moderators in early 2018. The effects of these mutual accommodations are yet to be seen. Meanwhile, German law enforcement occasionally surprises particularly bad-mouthed folks with raids on their homes.   Another similarity between the two nations has been the degree of protection afforded to internet users’ personal data, as well as their willingness to enforce this protection vis-à-vis Facebook and Google. Germany’s competition-regulating authority has gone after Zuckerberg & Co, citing alleged abuse of their dominant position in the personal data market. France took issue with Facebook’s apparently shady practices of harvesting WhatsApp users’ data without consent.A different privacy battle, now against Google, unfolded over the EU law granting users the “right to be forgotten” – a requirement for search engines to remove URLs containing irrelevant or outdated personal information upon individuals’ requests. A court in Munich issued an order demanding that Google’s URL takedown procedure be changed in a way that does not allow the purged links to resurface as easily as they do now. Meanwhile, France’s lawsuit against the search giant, seeking to extend the right to be forgotten to jurisdictions outside of the EU, will be heard by the EU Court of Justice after three years of litigation in the lower courts.  GAFA is an acronym that EU policymakers often use to refer to global (essentially, American) tech giants with massive European presence. Even though it originally stands for Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, the term has come to connote any platform of comparable stature, used mainly with regard to the need for holding them accountable. Taxation is one GAFA issue that European politicians have been hammering on throughout most of 2017 and early 2018. It is no secret that big tech companies have been ingenious in minimizing their tax obligations on their European profits for years, but now it appears that enough is enough for the EU.Germany and France have already tackled the issue at home: both nations introduced taxes on video distributors like Youtube and Netflix, with proceeds flowing to support production of local content. French government now seeks to advance EU-wide rules whereby digital companies would be taxed on revenues rather than profits, a move that will presumably alleviate the practice of registering the profits in low-tax EU jurisdictions instead of where they were earned. A ruling coalition in the German parliament proposes a slightly different solution: a consolidated tax system proportionately allocating companies’ European profits according to the geographic location of their customers. Regardless of whichever approach ultimately prevails, there is little doubt that the days of GAFA’s European tax havens are numbered.However peculiar and novel cryptocurrency regulation may seem, it does not emerge in a vacuum. Like any other sphere of governance, it bears the spirit and coloration of the wider system of legal control within which it operates. The story of Switzerland is canonic in this sense: it is hardly surprising that a country with traditionally little government presence and a tremendous record of accumulating and managing foreign wealth is emerging as a booming crypto hub.As Marc P. Bernegger, Swiss crypto entrepreneur and Board Member of the Crypto Finance Group in Zug, put it in an interview for Cointelegraph:“Switzerland has in general a very liberal approach and far less rules and regulation than other countries. With our direct democratic system the whole government is already decentralized, which seems to be one of the reasons for its crypto friendly behaviour. (…) Today literally every week there are several new blockchain companies moving to Crypto Nation Switzerland.”However, a principle that seems so intuitive in the Swiss case is less frequently invoked with regard to France and Germany. As common wisdom situates them both in the line of “progressive” liberal nations, many in the crypto community anticipate some latitude to be afforded by these governments. Yet, the ways in which French and German authorities have been handling tech industries suggests that we should be modest in our expectations.Both states clearly have a penchant for regulation. Regardless of whether it is a direct legislative control in the French style or a more “distributed” regulatory system akin to the German one that is employed for domestic use, on the outer flank European nation-states are equally protective of their sovereign realms. In the face of global forces tapping into their jurisdictions, both Germany and France prefer to act aggressively, whether it has to do with protecting citizens’ personal data or levying taxes on digital platforms. Security concerns over financing hate groups or terrorist activities could potentially yield restrictive outcomes, too. All in all, even when the signals that come from the European powerhouses are positive, Blockchain entrepreneurs should not be quick to celebrate: there might still be strings attached.On the bright side, state involvement in defining the rules of the game is not necessarily a dreadful thing. Since this is not a zero-sum situation, a meaningful dialogue between policymakers and organized industry interests may give rise to arrangements that make sense to all. At least in Germany, such a dialogue seems to be taking place. According to Blockchain Bundesverband, an advocacy group that advances the interests of the German crypto community, the government has begun to address Blockchain regulation in earnest. Dr. Nina Siedler, who is leading the organization’s Token/Finance working group, sounded optimistic on the matter:“The community wants fair rules, a level field for everyone. Most of the issues are covered by the existing laws, but the problem is that some of the rules are not very specific. The government’s presence in this process is not obtrusive, they don’t want to overregulate. They clearly want to give this rising economy a chance.”Dr. Siedler also suggested that some of the “grey zones” in Blockchain governance might well be addressed by a coordinated self-regulatory effort. She mentioned that a Europe-wide initiative is currently underway to formulate a Blockchain entrepreneur’s code of conduct, a set of best practices that will delineate the foundational tenets of the industry’s self-governance. This development offers some hope with regard to the future of European crypto regulation. As the case of the German ISPs illustrates, putting up organized interests early in the process of exploring uncharted policy area has a potential to put the whole industry in an advantageous position down the line.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #France    #Germany    #Switzerland    #ICO

EU Markets Watchdog Increases Requirements For Crypto Financial Derivatives,Ana Alexandre,3/27/2018 23:42,24238,280,"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has strengthened requirements for Contracts For Differences (CFDs) in cryptocurrencies, as stated in an announcement on March 27.CFDs are an arrangement in a futures contract whereby differences in settlement are made in cash payments, rather than by the delivery of physical goods or securities. It is considered an easier method of settlement, as all gains and losses are paid in cash. It also gives investors the same risks and benefits of a security, without actually owning one.The EU regulator will change the leverage limit of cryptocurrency CFDs to 2:1 at opening. This means that investors must have enough funds to cover at least half of a contract value upon opening. Initially, the leverage limit was fixed at a rate of 5:1, which allowed investors to enter the deal with only 20 percent of the CFD’s value on hand.In January 2018, ESMA issued a Call For Evidence regarding potential interference with digital currency CFDs, claiming that a very high price variation of cryptocurrencies as underlying assets gave rise to concerns for investor protection.In the most recent statement, ESMA highlighted that cryptocurrencies still pose risks to investment operations and require more cautious monitoring:“... For CFDs on cryptocurrencies many of these concerns remain present. Due to the specific characteristics of cryptocurrencies as an asset class the market for financial instruments providing exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as CFDs, will be closely monitored, and ESMA will assess whether stricter measures are required.”The position of ESMA is shared by other regulatory agencies in EU member states. In February, the French financial markets regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) released a statement that cryptocurrency derivatives must be regulated under new EU financial reforms. Meanwhile, trading platforms offering cryptocurrency CFDs must be regulated and cleared under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).In the same month, the Austrian Finance Minister proposed imposing regulations on cryptocurrency derivatives to prevent money laundering using digital currency.EU regulators have repetitively warned consumers about the “high risks” associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, emphasizing lack of protection and understanding, money loss, and problems with unregulated financial activities.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #EU    #Government    #Markets  
Chilean Exchanges Seek Clear Regulations On Crypto After Banks Denied Them Services,Helen Partz,3/27/2018 20:36,22263,241,"Two cryptocurrency exchanges BUDA and Crypto MKT, which operate in Chile and some other Latin American countries, have recently asked the Chilean Association of Banks (ABIF) to clarify its stance on cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency trading after the firms’ corporate accounts were closed by a number of Chilean banks, local news outlet PULSO reported March 25.In its public statement dubbed “Chile Can Make A Fool Of Itself Or Stand Out Worldwide”, BUDA and Crypto MKT ask ABIF to provide a transparent stance on cryptocurrencies, claiming that banks have been shutting down crypto exchanges’ accounts on instructions to “not open an account for anyone [related] to cryptocurrencies.”In the statement, both firms accused the financial institutions of “[a] lack of knowledge” of how the technology works. ?he joint statement states:“Due to the lack of knowledge and clarity some banks, out of fear, lack of information, or even poor strategy, are refusing or not offering services to people who are in the cryptocurrency market.”ABIF recently responded to the statement claiming that it is not responsible for resolving the problem between banks and crypto exchanges, stating that it is an “exclusive competence of each institution,"" and that the problem ""must be addressed and resolved in the context of the individual relationship of each bank with its customers.""As reported by El Mercurio, CEO of Scotiabank Chile Francisco Sardón said that the banks actions were not biased toward cryptocurrency firms and were reflective of a wider banking policy. According to Sardón, if any entity with an account does not provide an explanation of the origin of their income, or if the explanation is not clear or does not meet the expectations of the bank's compliance policies, the bank may chose to close that account.Pablo Chávez, CEO of Buda.com, commented that the industry should be regulated, and not banned due to lack of knowledge about the technology:""It is the use of technology which must be regulated. Prohibiting it without first understanding the technology and its implications is very bad and is closer to what China and Venezuela have done in these matters.”BUDA and Crypto MKT noted that the platforms are still operating as they have another bank account still active. The exchanges both note that they are registered and compliant with the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) of Chile and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), in addition to meeting standards for anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported on a Finnish cryptocurrency exchange, which may face closure since all but one bank in the country has refused to do business with crypto exchanges.

CBOE Recommends That The SEC Allows Bitcoin Exchange-Traded-Funds,Aaron Wood,3/27/2018 3:03,33600,663,"The exchange operator of CBOE Global Markets wrote a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), recommending they not interfere in the development of a Bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF) because they are similar to other commodity-based ETFs, March 23.ETFs are a type of exchange-traded-product (ETP). An ETF is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. ETFs trade like common stock on a stock exchange and typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than shares of mutual funds.CBOE President Chris Concannon’s letter was in written response to a letter issued by the SEC in January 2018 in which, among other concerns, the SEC expressed disquiet over sufficient liquidity in cryptocurrency markets, as well as potential risks for manipulation.Concannon stated that, “As the volumes continue to grow, especially on regulated US markets, the overall spot Bitcoin market looks more and more like a traditional commodity market and CBOE continues to believe that the spot market is sufficiently liquid to support a Bitcoin ETP.”Concannon added that, “...CBOE believes that the arbitrage mechanism would function identically to other commodity-related ETPs… thereby keeping the price of the ETP in line with the price of Bitcoin and limiting the risk of manipulation shares of the ETP.”Concannon echoed sentiments from a Congressional hearing earlier this month, in which experts suggested that existing legislation is sufficient to regulate certain aspects of cryptocurrencies.“While CBOE shares many of the concerns raised in the Staff Letter, we believe that the vast majority of these concerns can be addressed within the existing framework for commodity-related funds related to valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage, and manipulation,” Concannon wrote in his letter to Dalia Blass, a Director of the Division of Investment Management.The SEC has been stepping up measures against crypto-related companies this year. On March 15 the SEC confirmed dozens of probes into cryptocurrency companies, issuing subpoenas to firms it suspects of flouting securities laws during initial coin offerings (ICO). Earlier this week, a source speaking to WSJ said that the SEC will increase its scrutiny in launching examinations into up to 100 hedge funds.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #Government  
Twitter Confirms Ban On Cryptocurrency Ads,Aaron Wood,3/26/2018 21:38,23537,555,"Twitter Inc will start banning cryptocurrency advertising effective Tuesday, Reuters reports March 26.Twitter has confirmed rumors that the social media giant would follow Facebook and Google in clamping down on crypto-related advertising.Twitter told Reuters that the ban will cover advertising for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and token sales. The policy will be introduced over the course of the next 30 days and will also include bans on cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services, unless they are public companies and are listed on major stock exchanges. Twitter said it will limit advertisement for crypto exchanges in Japan to those under the purview of the national financial regulator.Twitter cites safety for users as the primary motivator behind the ban. Twitter was already taking measures to prevent crypto-related accounts from “engaging with others in a deceptive manner”, but faced calls to enact futher measures following bans from Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc (Google).Crypto markets, which were already experiencing a slip on Monday, fell even further following the announcement from Twitter.Talking to Reuters, director Zennon Kapron of financial consultancy Kapronasia cited risks to Twitter itself as another motivator behind the ban:“With the increasing number of ICOs coming to market, it is an impossible task for anyone, much less platforms like Twitter or Facebook, to keep on top of which ICOs and cryptocurrencies are genuine versus frauds… Although certainly ICO advertising must have been a significant source of revenue for Twitter, the repercussions of fraudulent activities just weren’t worth the risk.”Facebook restricted crypto advertising in January of this year, while Google announced a ban earlier this month that will be enacted in June 2018.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Twitter  
"Latest Pronouncements From OECD, EU & G20 Allow Fintech To Flourish: Expert Take",Selva Ozelli,3/26/2018 13:28,21028,359,"In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation, and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to george@cointelegraph.com.Last week marked the 10-year anniversary of Bear Stearns' infamous collapse at the dawn of the global financial crisis caused by highly leveraged mortgage-back-security lending and related transactions - an event which allowed for today's crypto economy to emerge. It was also the week the topic of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology and digital taxation received considerable coordinated attention from global Intergovernmental organizations, regulators, legislators and central banks who discussed their impact on financial stability and potential uses in tax evasion and illegal activities during the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina.During the meeting, world's economic leaders agreed that cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology, given its borderless and intangible nature, are fundamentally reshaping the global cross-border financial connectedness, and its increasing ability to automate cognitive tasks. The G20 settled on characterizing cryptocurrencies as property, thereby setting the stage for cryptocurrencies to be adapted as a new digital-asset-class.   They committed to implementing Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing standards as they apply to crypto-assets to mitigate concerns over security, consumer protection, and financial crime.  As well as to abide by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework, study international nexus and profit allocation concepts for taxing the digital economy (BEPS Action 1) and come up with a new approach by 2020, as agreed upon by 113 countries. They also established a July 2018 deadline for proposals for cryptocurrency regulations.With a long-term solution to taxing digital firms postponed to 2020, the EU Commission took the lead on proposing two new digital tax rules that will be submitted to the Council for adoption and to the European Parliament for consultation.The first one suggests a common reform of the EU's corporate tax rules to enable member states to tax digital profits that are generated in their territory, even if a company does not have a physical presence there. A digital platform will be deemed to have a taxable nexus, 'digital presence' or a virtual permanent establishment in a member state if it fulfils one of the following criteria. It exceeds a threshold of seven mln euro in annual revenues in a member state or has more than 100,000 users there in a taxable year, it has over 3,000 business contracts for digital services that are created between the company and business users in a taxable year. This proposal resembles a concept of nexus by Internet “cookies,” which differs from the physical presence nexus test as defined under OECD Model Tax Conventions.Commission’s second proposal imposes a temporary interim tax of three percent to companies with total annual worldwide revenues of 750 mln euro and EU revenues of 50 mln euro on certain digital revenues created from selling online advertising space, digital intermediary activities which allow users to interact with other users and which can facilitate the sale of goods and services between them, selling data generated from user-provided information. This interim tax will be repealed once a long-term solution is jointly agreed upon by the OECD.With the fintech friendly announcements from OECD, EU, G20 and increased interest in crypto-assets by institutional investors, a new type of Fintech business- crypto-asset lending has been surfacing all over the world.It’s a similar business to securities lending, which utilizes long-term stock holdings of institutional lenders, such as mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, exchange-traded funds and sovereign wealth funds, that would otherwise sit idle by temporarily lending them out on a collateralized basis and investing the cash in safe, short-term investments for a modest return.Borrowers, typically hedge funds, use the securities to cover short positions, to hedge positions or to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. They post securities as collateral that is usually 102-105 percent of the market value of the securities, with a promise to both return the shares, the same type and amount of securities, on demand and cover any dividends paid out in the meantime. If the shares are liquid and easy to borrow, the lender gets a modest fee for its cooperation and keeps an agreed-upon percentage of the interest earned on the collateral.In the 1990s and 2000s, the demand for securities lending grew with the expansion of global securities markets and the exponential increase in short-selling by hedge funds. In 2007, there was an estimated $5.5 tln worth of securities on loan through various lending programs. But during the financial meltdown when securities prices fell precipitously, widespread abuses by securities lending agents came to light that led to disastrous losses for institutional securities lenders.Market demand from institutional crypto-asset owners such as hedge funds and miners are fueling different types of crypto-asset lending businesses to emerge. Including U.S. mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, with $6.3 tln under administration, which has entered the crypto-mining business because, a company official said, ‘‘we can see that the evolution of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology is setting the investment industry up for disruption.”Some crypto-asset lenders are offering fiat currency loans to accredited investors who purchase a token to become members of their firms. These loans do not require a credit check or much paperwork but are expensive. Borrowers put up as much as 200 percent in crypto-asset collateral, for fiat currency loans issued at interest rates ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent.  Other companies are peer-to-peer lenders where the platform matches lenders to borrowers in return for a fee.  Crypto-asset-lending firms, backed by Blockchain technology, designed to reduce fraud, are exploring ways to offer the loans that make automatic interest payments via smart contracts.   These companies are nevertheless subject to similar risks associated with securities-lending and more.A crypto-assets’ value, which will serve as the collateral to a loan, is determined based on the demand for the cryptocurrency or token which may be highly volatile and illiquid as well as the financial performance of the token issuing company. Currently, there isn’t a standardized way of determining a crypto-assets value, because different exchanges are trading the same crypto-assets at different prices. This makes margin call monitoring especially difficult to implement for crypto-asset lending firms.The crypto-asset lending firms are established on Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) platforms which are in its early stages of development, and their application is of experimental nature. These platforms are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, attacks or other disruptions of a similar nature (Hacks) as well as hard forks.Global regulators, legislators and central bankers have committed to devising effective AML/KYC regulations for crypto-assets by July 2018.  It is not known whether they will come up with a coordinated approach to regulations for cross-border crypto-asset lending transactions as it pertains to registering securities interests in crypto-assets and their treatment under bankruptcy laws by the upcoming deadline.Furthermore, it should be noted that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance on crypto taxation does not address crypto-asset loans or hard forks. In the event IRS treats crypto-asset lending transactions or hard forks as tax realization events, the resulting US tax obligations along with the applicable penalties for failing to file applicable tax returns could make the crypto-asset loans all the more expensive. Borrowers, including offshore hedge funds, are urged to take in to consideration the uncertain US tax treatment of their crypto-asset financing transactions and if need be, take advantage of the IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program before it ends by September 2018. On March 23 the IRS reminded taxpayers to report their virtual currency transactions or face applicable civil, as well as the criminal penalties for non-compliance.  The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph. Selva Ozelli, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for Tax Notes, Bloomberg BNA, other publications and the OECD.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taxes    #Cryptocurrencies    #Lending

New Jersey’s Bureau of Securities had issued a cease and desist order March 7, 2018 stating that Bitcoiin offered securities, as defined by N.J.S.A. 49: 3-49(m), that were not registered with the Bureau.In the alert, TDCI Assistant Commissioner Frank Borger-Gilligan shared the state regulator’s concerns:“Rushing into an investment that you don’t fully understand can be bad for your bottom line. We encourage Tennesseans to always conduct thorough research to learn the risks associated with the investments they are considering.”In February, Bitcoiin announced in a press release that Hollywood figure Steven Seagal was the coin’s new worldwide ambassador and reported that the actor had become “a believer of Bitcoiin2Gen”. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had previously issued warnings about the involvement of celebrities in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), ruled that “Steven Seagal has to ensure that the Bitcoiin investments are appropriate and in compliance with federal and state securities laws.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA  
WSJ: SEC To Examine Up To 100 Crypto-Related Hedge Funds,Aaron Wood,3/23/2018 6:57,26391,281,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing to examine up to 100 hedge funds that deal with cryptocurrencies, a person familiar with the matter told WSJ March 22.The initiative is separate from the dozens of cryptocurrency probes, which mainly target companies the SEC suspects of running afoul of securities laws via Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).While examiners will report any suspicious activity uncovered in the course of their examinations, the main purpose of the initiative is to inform how the commission’s policies should address cryptocurrencies, the source told WSJ.Marc Elovitz, a partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP, a firm which advises hedge funds, said that, “This is a way for the SEC overall to gather information and learn about important new technology and products.” Examiners conduct these types of operations “to educate the commission overall about new businesses or new industries.”The operation will begin in the next two months, the source tells WSJ. Examiners will inspect whether the assets bought by fund managers match those which they advertised to investors in disclosure documents. The SEC will also look at the risk disclosures provided to investors and  see how thoroughly documents explain the strategy of trading cryptocurrencies or tokens, the source said. The source added that the SEC has identified at least 100 private fund managers whose holdings are focused in crypto.According to WSJ, hedge funds are most likely to hold cryptocurrencies, but private-equity firms may be examined as well if their funds own digital assets either directly, or through companies linked to the crypto industry.The SEC directly regulates managers of private funds that oversee at least $150 mln and also has the authority to periodically inspect smaller firms. As many as 84 cryptocurrency hedge funds were launched in 2017.The reported examination of hedge funds follows a pattern of increase scrutiny by the US financial regulator.

US Dept. Of Treasury Could Add Crypto Wallets Of Sanctioned Persons To Blacklist,Ana Alexandre,3/22/2018 7:10,17594,219,"The US Department of the Treasury may begin adding digital currency addresses to its sanctions list if they can tie them to a sanctioned individual, according to a document issued March 19.The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) may add digital currencies addresses and wallets to the Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List (SDN). The measure would, “alert the public of specific digital currency identifiers associated with a blocked person.”The OFAC’s listings “are not likely to be exhaustive,” the document stated, “Parties who identify digital currency identifiers or wallets that they believe are owned by, or otherwise associated with, an SDN and hold such property should take the necessary steps to block the relevant digital currency and file a report with OFAC that includes information about the wallet’s or address’s ownership, and any other relevant details.”The OFAC offers no single compliance solution, and suggests that the development of a tailored, risk-based compliance program falls upon individual companies, exchanges, and users of cryptocurrencies. The program mechanism looks similar to know-your-customer (KYC) procedure, which includes sanctions list screening and other relevant measures. US persons and firms will be responsible for ensuring they are not engaged in transactions prohibited by the sanctions or illicit trade and investment-related transactions.The Treasury claims it will use sanctions to fight against criminal and malicious actors, which take advantage of digital currencies “as a complement to existing tools”:“To strengthen our efforts to combat the illicit use of digital currency transactions under our existing authorities, OFAC may include as identifiers on the SDN List specific digital currency addresses associated with blocked persons.”The document follows an Executive Order issued by President Trump on March 19, which bans the Petro, the Venezuelan government-backed cryptocurrency, and prohibits American investors from participating in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the cryptocurrency.Earlier this week, classified documents provided by Edward Snowden to The Intercept revealed that The US National Security Agency (NSA) managed to create a system to track down and deanonymize cryptocurrency users.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies    #Wallets    #Transactions    #Government  
Why Would South Korea Plan to Legalize ICOs Again?,Joseph Young,3/21/2018 19:32,29482,452,"Last week, The Korea Times, a mainstream media founded by the country’s largest newspaper Hankook Ilbo, reported that sources within the government revealed the plans of local financial authorities to legalize initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the future.""The financial authorities have been talking to the country's tax agency, justice ministry and other relevant government offices about a plan to allow ICOs in Korea when certain conditions are met,"" an unnamed source told The Korea Times who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject.Most recently, Choi Jong-ku Financial Services Commission (FSC) chairman expressed his concerns towards domestic ICOs, citing high risks involved for investors within the cryptocurrency market.In a conference held at the Seoul Government Office, FSC chairman Choi stated that the agency still remains skeptical towards the investor protection policies in place. Choi’s statement translated by Cointelegraph reads:“There is a possibility that during the creation and issuance of a new digital currency through an ICO, various Ponzi schemes and scam operations may emerge. The agency will remain its negative stance towards the investor protection policies currently imposed on the local cryptocurrency market.”Still, despite the concerns over investor protection by the FSC, several sources within the government told The Korea Times that local financial authorities are attempting to authorize domestic ICOs by enabling strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems, as well as a taxation policy for investors.In essence, the South Korean government is willing to allow companies to conduct ICOs as long as the token sales are registered with the government, which is similar to the viewpoint of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In December 2017, the US SEC stated that while private ICOs can be conducted within the US targeting local investors, they must be registered with the SEC. As of December, the SEC stated that there were no ICOs registered with the agency and that no ICOs are allowed to accommodate US-based investors.“A number of concerns have been raised regarding the cryptocurrency and ICO markets, including that, as they are currently operating, there is substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation. Investors should understand that to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies,” the SEC said.However, the SEC has not completely ruled out ICOs. Its chairman Jay Clayton stated in a cryptocurrency hearing that every ICO is a security because the value of tokens is directly affected by the performance of the businesses distributing them, as Cointelegraph previously reported.Currently, the South Korean government is on a similar page with the US SEC, in that it is willing to allow ICOs that are registered with local financial authorities and are conducted transparently. Another unnamed source within the government told The Korea Times:“Various scenarios such as the imposition of a value-added tax, a capital gains tax, or both on trade; and the collection of corporate tax from local cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as the initiation of authorized exchanges with licenses are being discussed.”FSC cryptocurrency trading policies director Kang Young-soo confirmed that there are speculations about the potential legalization of ICOs, as he said:""There are many speculating about the possibility of allowing ICOs. The FSC has acknowledged a third-party view regarding the issue, but there's nothing that we can say officially at the moment.”On March 5, several mainstream media outlets in South Korea including Asia Business and Huffington Post Korea revealed that Kakao, the country’s largest Internet conglomerate which oversees KakaoTalk, KakaoPay, KakaoStory and KakaoTaxi, applications that have over 90 percent market penetration in their respective markets including fintech, taxi service, messaging, and social media, is focusing on integrating cryptocurrencies for its 12,000 merchants and over 100 mln users.Kakao is reportedly planning to integrate cryptocurrencies on all of its applications, which would allow users to utilize KakaoPay to send and receive cryptocurrencies while paying for services on platforms like KakaoTaxi. Kakao also revealed its plans to conduct an ICO and to release its own token.But, Asia Business reported that due to the current regulations on domestic ICOs, Kakao is planning to conduct its ICO outside of South Korea, to circumvent local policies.If Kakao decides to conduct its ICO elsewhere and moves its Blockchain business outside of the country, it may lead to a substantial loss for the South Korean economy, especially in the Blockchain sector. It could lead to a domino effect, convincing other businesses and startups targeting the Blockchain sector to move outside of South Korea.Almost immediately after reports around Kakao’s plans to launch an ICO outside of the country were released, FSC chairman Choi stated that the ICO of Kakao may violate existing regulations established by the local government.“Even if there is no prohibition on cryptocurrency or digital asset trading, there is a possibility that it [Kakao ICO] may be regarded as fraud or multi-level sales according to the issuance method. Since the risk is very high in terms of investor protection, the government has a negative stance on the ICO.”It is entirely likely that the South Korean government is moving towards legalizing ICOs to prevent the country’s leading conglomerates from leaving South Korea to conduct ICOs, which may damage the local Blockchain sector and cryptocurrency industry.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tradings  
Thailand’s Government Battle With Crypto Enters Decisive Phase,Stephen O'Neal,3/21/2018 16:05,18057,202,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.Last week Thailand’s government issued drafts of two laws regarding cryptocurrency and ICO legislation. There is a certain cause for optimism as long as Thai lawmakers intend not to ban, but to regulate the technology. Nevertheless, any fears remain legitimate after Veerathai Santiprabhob, governor of the Central Bank of Thailand asked all banks in the country to stay away from cryptocurrency in February.Now that it has become clear that the local government is planning to introduce a regulatory framework for the so-called ‘Digital Assets,’ we oversee the recent history of Thailand government’s relationship with crypto.There are drafts of two laws that were approved in principle by the cabinet on March 13: one to regulate digital-asset-related transactions and another to essentially introduce tax levies on digital assets. The Finance Ministry of Thailand defines ‘digital assets’ as “cryptocurrencies, digital tokens and other assets in the form of electronic data.”The main regulatory body is Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which, according to Bangkok Post, “has received endorsement from financial experts.” One of the supporters, the chairman of The Thai Fintech Association (TFA) and a former finance minister Korn Chatikavanij argued that:""Digital assets are new for everyone, and no one knows everything [about them], so all parties should be open-minded, learn about them and have proper rules and regulations."" Focusing on the latter, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam explained to the cabinet that the government needed to issue new laws to regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs because the latter could be used in the context of “money laundering, tax avoidance and crime,” which, in turn, could hurt potential investors and the economy as a whole.In February ?entral Bank of Thailand has banned all banks in the country from investing and trading in crypto, as well as participating in and creating platforms for such trading. However, the decision applies specifically to banks, not to existing exchanges or other services, which are still allowed to operate freely in Thailand. Local banks had also been asked not to advise customers on crypto investment or trading, and to ban clients from using credit cards for crypto purchases.In response to the circular, major Thai banks started to shut down their crypto trade accounts. The first financial institution to do that was Bangkok Bank, which terminated its accounts on TDAX, a popular privately-owned Thai cryptocurrency exchange. Then the state-owned Krungthai Bank also stopped trading via TDAX. By the end of February, TDAX still had bank accounts with two other financial institutions: Kasikornbank (Kbank) and Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), however their status with the crypto exchange platform is unclear at this point.The first law is also known as the Act on Digital Asset Businesses. It requires that all crypto transactions, including those within digital asset exchanges, brokers and dealers, will have to get registration from the relevant authorities once the draft gets final approval from the cabinet.In other words, those businesses will have to share transaction information as well as the names of buyers and sellers with the Anti-Money Laundering Office and, potentially, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The document also imposes penalties and remedies for violations of that know-your-customer compliance, although their rate is unclear at this point.The second law is basically the revision of the country’s Revenue Code to introduce taxation on digital assets. Essentially, the document will let the tax-collection agency to impose a capital gains tax on investment gains and benefits from crypto. The cabinet will consider the exact rates of the capital gains tax this week, and the ceiling is expected to be set at 15 percent.Local media points out that there is a law that allows the Revenue Department to tax income derived from various activities, including cryptocurrency investments, however, the tax-collecting agency wants to set clear guidelines first.Arnat Leemakdej, professor at Thammasat Business School, argued that ""those who trade cryptocurrencies could be taxed and such taxation has already started in the US” adding that traders could start trading crypto overseas, but in that case, they could be subject to money laundering liability once they move those gains back into Thailand.That, in turn, would motivate them to keep the profit abroad. In Leemakdej’s opinion, this tax tries to ""shoot two birds with one stone"" by seeking a way to generate benefit for the state and prevent crypto speculation at the same time.Among the news about potential regulatory actions from the government, ICOs began growing in popularity in Thailand. The number of local companies racing to hold their initial coin offerings before regulations would hit was growing steadily.In February, J Ventures, a subsidiary of Jay Mart Plc which is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), managed to become the first company in Thailand to launch a successful ICO. The company raised around 660 million baht ($21 mln) by selling out its 100 mln JFin digital tokens within 55 hours. Now that all ICO-related processes have been put on hold due to the upcoming introduction regulatory framework, the coin’s future has become unclear. Thai Rath has reported that “Thai private companies that have already issued an ICO must comply with the law within six months.”Adisak Sukumvitaya, chief executive at Jay Mart Plc, stated that the government had generated a certain level of uncertainty by not allowing its citizens to know the full picture regarding government regulations or intentions:“Personally, I think the regulator should announce a clear picture for the cryptocurrency regulatory[framework] at one time rather than gradually[unveil] the framework in bits and pieces.”Another Thai company with plans for an ICO launch, a fintech startup Stockradars, was late to the race. According to the website of its social trading platform, there was a pre-sale ICO held on March 8, however, the mass sale was planned on April 22, which falls under the new regulations.TDAX has shut down its ICO operations as well, stating that “due to uncertain regulation that may be announced soon from SEC, we have suspended the ICO portal operations for the moment until we get more clarification on the situation.”It is not uncommon when the state tries to ban crypto activities due to their decentralized nature. However some governments intend to benefit from digital assets, not to forbid them. Apart from Thailand, a stark example is the Indian government, which have been introducing a number of regulations to local crypto deals with a regulatory framework being in the works as well. For instance, in February the Indian tax authority sent notices to 100,000 crypto traders in the country asking them to pay taxes.The local industry seems to comply with the government regulations. A group called The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee (BACC), which includes seven cryptocurrency exchanges like Unocoin, Zebpay and Coinsecure, is planning to create a database of crypto users and transactions in response to the government’s action. User account data would be recorded using either an Aadhaar ID or a Permanent Account Number.According to The Times of India, as regulations tighten in the country, crypto enthusiasts turned to a network of friends and family members for buying and selling digital coins. L.R. Dinesh, a local Bitcoin aficionado who uses the cryptocurrency to buy things from overseas, told the publication: “For the online tech community, there are some who receive Bitcoins as payment for gadget and video game reviews. But for regular purchases, one has to get a relative or friend with an overseas account to send over Bitcoins.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Thailand    #ICO    #Finance  
ICOs Need Fresh Regulatory Guidelines From SEC,Gareth Jenkinson,3/21/2018 9:19,15613,269,"An overarching theme for cryptocurrencies in 2018 has been developments in regulatory frameworks around the world.From South Korea, Russia, and the United States, governments and financial regulatory bodies have been hard at work creating new frameworks that will look to settle a continually turbulent cryptocurrency market as well as initial coin offerings (ICOs).In America, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Committee (CFTC) have been somewhat of a revelation for the cryptocurrency world, after a serious downturn in the markets in January 2018.Bitcoin and almost every other altcoin saw sharp declines from December highs amid misinformation and uncertainty around the world. In the American setting, the SEC and CFTC hearing in February provided a lifeline for cryptocurrencies and ICOs, promising to create regulatory frameworks that would nurture the developing market.While the SEC and CFTC are actively seeking to foster cryptocurrencies and ICOs, there is one glaring problem.Regulations governing securities in America have been around for a long time, and many of these stocks and bonds apply to vastly different businesses. This is where things can get slightly tricky.SEC regulations are set out in the Securities Act of 1933, as noted by SEC chairman Jay Clayton in his testimony in February, so we are working off frameworks established over 80 years ago.Many ICOs have vastly different business plans and solutions, using distributed ledger technology. While the tokens they use to power their platforms and businesses may be classed as securities by current laws - it’s fair to say that they need new, informed regulations that take into account different business plans.US based corporate lawyer Dean Steinbeck told Cointelegraph that securities regulations need to be reworked to provide unique guidelines for ICOs.“I do think that the Securities Act of 1933 should be amended to properly accommodate token sales and clarify when they should be considered securities offerings. The marketplace needs this as the regulatory uncertainty is paralyzing so many projects.”Steinbeck goes on to add that the act doesn’t need to be replaced or eliminated - as it still fulfills its primary role which ensures that investors make informed investment decisions based on truthful information.Furthermore, Steinbeck believes that 2018 should see these regulators come out with industry specific guidelines or regulations that will breathe new life into the sector. There are some pertinent questions that will distinguish ICOs and their varying business models, as posed by Steinbeck:“Which tokens are securities? Which tokens are commodities? When does an ICO need to be registered? There are so many questions that need to be answered, even from a basic definitional perspective.”Given the short time in which cryptocurrencies and ICOs have exploded onto the scene, the SEC has done well to work in guidelines to a cutting edge industry.The SEC isn’t blind to this fact - and perhaps one of Clayton’s parting sentiments is pertinent to mention. Regulators are asking companies that are planning ICOs to do their due diligence, or face the consequences of infringing on the laws, however outdated they may be:“The Commission's message to issuers and market professionals in this space was clear: those who would use distributed ledger technology to raise capital or engage in securities transactions must take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the federal securities laws.”ICOs need to carefully consider the characteristics of their tokens - which can fall into different categories all together.2017 was a watershed year for cryptocurrencies as a whole - but the rising success of Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular gave rise to a plethora of ICOs. A lot of developers with a half-baked, Blockchain-based idea launched websites and actively sought funding through ICOs.Admittedly many ICOs were launched in earnest, with sound and progressive solutions backed by Blockchain technology paving the way for a new innovations within the space.Sadly that was intermingled with outright scams. Some ICO founders simply ran away with funds raids for tokens, while others, like the now infamous ponzi scheme Bitconnect, launched successfully but ended up failing, leading to class-action lawsuits.It must be said that Bitconnect had also received cease and desist orders from the Texas Securities commissioner in the months leading up to its closure.Instances like these have led to the SEC and the CFTC to take a sterner stance towards ICOs.The bodies are concerned with the nature of ICO tokens which they effectively consider as securities - like any publicly traded stock or bond. Most ICOs offer a token in exchange for fiat currency, with investors hopeful that whatever blockchain service being developed will give them healthy returns on investment.According to Clayton, over $4 bln was raised by ICOs in America in 2017 alone. According to data from ICO statistics website Coinschedule, 210 ICOs were successfully launched in 2017, while we have had 86 ICOs launched since the start of 2018.Image source: CoinscheduleImage source: CoinscheduleGiven that there have already been 81 ICOs started by March 2018 and that rate continues for the rest of the year, we could surpass the number of ICOs seen last year.With that in mind, any fresh guidelines provided by the SEC of CFTC will have profound effects on ICOs and investors confidence.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #ICO    #Government  
G20 and Cryptocurrencies: Baby Steps Towards Regulatory Recommendations,Darryn Pollock,3/21/2018 8:37,27619,470,"Late last year, when interest in Bitcoin and its price was at its peak, France’s finance minister suggested that there be a public debate of Bitcoin at the G20 summit which concluded this week.The conclusion of this meeting, in regards to where the nations now stand on cryptocurrencies, is that a firm July deadline has been put forward for recommendations on how to regulate cryptocurrencies globally.There was some general uptake and interest in approaching this hitherto unknown and confusing space as countries had, up until now been forging forward mostly on their own in terms of regulations.However, as the conference kicked off, the buck was soon slowed as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) - which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies - resisted calls from some G20 members to discuss regulating cryptocurrencies at the conference.Instead, many of the member states, but also a few notable exceptions, decided that cryptocurrencies needed to be examined further, and that more information was needed before any regulations could be proposed.Therefore the first steps have been laid as July will see G20 nations bringing forward their data and information to begin recommendations on how to go about globally regulating cryptocurrencies.The announcement came from Argentina Central Bank chair Federico Sturzenegger who said:""In July we have to offer very concrete, very specific recommendations on not 'what do we regulate?' but 'what is the data we need?'”This statement essentially indicates that there is at least agreement from some, not all, of the nations that they need to gather enough tangible data and information so that when they do sit down again in July, they can start discussing the next steps towards regulation.At this stage, it is all very much baby steps, and purely a feeling out stage, but it is at least directional and shows that around the world, economic powers are taking the cryptocurrency market seriously.However, as is so often the case with a bevy of varying nations with their own ideals, there are already countries going rogue from this first step.Brazil Central Bank president Ilan Goldfajn said cryptocurrencies will not be regulated in his country, according to news service El Cronista. Furthermore, Goldfajn added that he will not necessarily be following the G20 recommendations.One thing that was pretty much wholly agreed upon by the G20 was that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) - an intergovernmental body formed to fight money laundering and terrorist financing - would have its standards applied to the cryptocurrency markets in the respective countries.The G20 said:""We commit to implement the FATF standards as they apply to crypto-assets, look forward to the FATF review of those standards, and call on the FATF to advance global implementation. We call on international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) to continue their monitoring of crypto-assets and their risks, according to their mandates, and assess multilateral responses as needed.""In the same draft statement, more insight was given as to how these financial powerhouses view cryptocurrencies. The overall view is that the G20 “acknowledge that technological innovation, including that underlying crypto-assets, has the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system and the economy more broadly”However, the caveat is:“Crypto assets do, however, raise issues with respect to consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.”Furthermore, the concerns for the G20 surrounding cryptocurrencies is that they believe that they “lack the key attributes of sovereign currencies. At some point they could have financial stability implications.”There was hopes from the likes of France, and Germany that Bitcoin would be a strong topic of conversation at the G20 summit and that perhaps regulations could start to be formalised.However, the FSB made a decision not to embark on this building of global cryptocurrency regulation at the conference because it intended to shore up a few of the existing economic rules, rather focusing in on existing regulations. FSB Chair Mark Carney said:“As its work to fix the fault lines that caused the financial crisis draws to a close, the FSB is increasingly pivoting away from design of new policy initiatives towards dynamic implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects of the agreed G20 reforms.”  Additionally, the FSB’s view of cryptocurrencies is that they “do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time.”Bitcoin’s price reacted fairly well to the news that the financial superpowers of the globe would not be honing in on digital currencies yet, and managed to break out of a slump that saw it dip below $8,000 over the weekend.It has further jumped to over $9,000 on the back of these positive talks held by the economic powers of the world on cryptocurrencies.It is important at this juncture of global summits to look deeper at where the G20 nations each stand when it comes to their own cryptocurrency regulation. In doing this, one can start to see how broadly split opinions are over the spectrum – from positive and embracing, to negative and banning.Brazil has already said it will not necessarily be following the path laid down by the G20 when it does eventually come to designing a global regulatory framework, and no doubt, others will follow based on how they have gone about things so far.Argentina, despite being an important South American hub for cryptocurrencies, has never really flourished with interest in the digital currency wave sweeping the globe. The number of Bitcoin users in Argentina is still pretty small, in truth, and barely registers on statistics that track worldwide usage of the currency.However, where Argentina has an edge in cryptocurrencies is the use of them for buying everyday tangible assets. They are also currently being used as a go-around for the onerous restrictions on importing foreign currency.But the use of an unregulated currency to divert governmental policies screams of something that will be up for regulatory pressures in the near future, perhaps when it becomes more popular.Australia is one of the few countries that has actively started building its own cryptocurrency regulations that suit it, without much outward glancing for hints or presidents. For example, the government recently addressed exchange regulations with a mandatory law.The Australian government has implemented a law mandating Bitcoin exchanges operating in the country to register with the anti-money laundering agency Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).The move is aimed at imposing restrictions on digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, due to their continuous growth and adoption in the mainstream financial sector.Brazil and its government have seen a lot of potential in Blockchain and to that end have started upping their efforts into research and development of the new technology.The Brazilian central bank Banco Central do Brasil is ramping up its research and development efforts on Blockchain technology. The central bank is reportedly experimenting with “just about every Blockchain platform it can get its hands on.”Canada is another country that is in a similar boat to that of Australia as they have started the arduous journey of regulating, but in a positive and friendly manner. The Canadian government has given the go ahead to its first ever Blockchain-based Exchange Traded Fund.Additionally, the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) announced that they will soon launch a securities clearing and settlement platform based on the Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain that lets companies raise capital with security tokens.On the very other end of the scale is China, and more than enough has been spoken about when it comes to China’s view on Bitcoin. The People’s Republic has been hard nosed since it first instituted a nation wide ban on ICOs.What followed was the banning of exchanges, effectively trying to cut off the citizens from using and trading in digital currencies, and, when that was ineffective, a massive firewall was raised to put the final nail in the Bitcoin coffin in the country.As one of the nations looking to open up the dialog on cryptocurrency, France’s stance is clearly geared towards building a regulatory framework that can work globally for a currency that is used globally.“I am going to propose to the next G20 president, Argentina, that at the G20 summit in April we have a discussion all together on the question of Bitcoin. There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate Bitcoin,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.Germany are also keen on opening up this dialog, having stated before the G20 suggestion was made, that the only way to control cryptocurrencies would be for international cooperation.""Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited,” Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the board of Germany's Bundesbank, suggested.India, while not yet banning cryptocurrencies, is clearly not the biggest fan globally when it comes to their operating in the state’s borders.Bitcoin exchanges are under fire in India, as many of the nation’s top banks have suspended or greatly curtailed functionality on exchange accounts. The State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank have all taken strong action toward crypto exchanges, either closing accounts or severely limiting functionality.Another country that is less impressed with Bitcoin than others, the Indonesian Central Bank has continued its campaign against digital currencies as it ordered a ban on the use of the leading virtual currency Bitcoin as a method of payment in October last year.The bank claimed that Bitcoin represents neither a legal nor a recognized medium of exchange and payment in Indonesia.Italy have recently come forward with a decree that aims to classify the use of cryptocurrencies in the country and to list “service providers related to digital currencies.” This is clearly a Bitcoin-friendly move, and one that services the booming Bitcoin businesses that are building around the digital currency.Japan made headlines a few years back when it announced that Bitcoin was a legal currency, however, its loose approach to regulation has recently been curtailed as more and more issues have forced regulators to step in.January’s hack of the Japanese-based crypto exchange Coincheck, with losses totalling more than $534 mln in NEM, the largest hack in the crypto world since Mt. Gox.Now, Japanese exchanges are aiming to self-regulator to try and alleviate the pains for the government who have been put under pressure to protect their citizens.Two trade groups in Japan’s cryptocurrency industry have agreed to form an as-of-yet unnamed organization next month that will self regulate the local crypto market in conjunction with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), it was reported.Mexico will soon be joining the likes of Canada and Australia as countries with active cryptocurrency regulations.The central American nation is just one signature away from regulating cryptocurrency after a law setting out its position passed the lower house.Combining new resolutions on fintech more generally, including crowdfunding and various aspects of cryptocurrency businesses, the bill now only requires a signature from President Enrique Peña Nieto before it becomes law.Russia is another major country whose crypto regulatory stance has been well documented. The latest out of the socialist republic is that the government is looking to regulate and control digital currencies to the point of banning access to decentralized exchanges, and working on launching its own coin.The Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB) has announced that the government’s long-discussed idea for a state-issued cryptocurrency, referred to as the CryptoRuble, will be launched in the middle of 2019.The Islamic Monarchy of Saudi Arabia has not had much dealings with cryptocurrencies that have made the mainstream media, but their general approach to such corruption and forms of money laundering are strict and no doubt Bitcoin would be viewed with suspicion.Saudi Arabia arrested the richest Arab in the world, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal last year - a man hostile to Bitcoin - on corruption charges.As the epicentre of cryptocurrency in Africa, South Africa has approached the technology with interest and is looking to understand and analyse it before making any forms of stringent and harsh regulations.The central bank has opened up a sand box for companies to operate in a regulatory safe space in order to assess the outcomes of Blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions.South Korea has also recently been in the news, for the wrong reasons, when it was announced that it would be banning cryptocurrencies in February after the Ministry of Justice independently announced its plans of banning cryptocurrency trading.The Ministry did this without the consent of the Ministry of Strategy and Justice and other government agencies involved in the South Korean cryptocurrency regulation task force.Turkey, as well as Iran, have apparently been mulling over the idea of building their own cryptocurrency, much like G20 ally Russia, as well as Venezuela with its functioning Petro coin.The UK as not stepped fully into the ring of cryptocurrency regulation, but rather has been forthright with its warnings of the dangers that are persistent with cryptocurrency investing.The Treasury Committee of the UK Parliament launched an inquiry into cryptocurrencies and their effect on UK investors and businesses in February.The inquiry was prompted by the rising global interest in cryptocurrencies, as well as the ongoing rise and fall of the crypto market since the new year.The US has had an ongoing regulatory process with Bitcoin as the Securities and Exchange Commission has stepping heavily when it comes to ICO monitoring, but the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has indicated that there is no reason to harm cryptocurrencies.“Do no harm” was unquestionably the right approach to development of the Internet. Similarly, I believe that “do no harm” is the right overarching approach for distributed ledger technology,” J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman and witness of the CFTC, expressed in front of the Senate this year.The EU, following along with Britain, who will soon be breaking away, has rather instituted warnings that imposed any set or stringent rules. In fact, the matter of regulating them has not really cropped up very high on the to-do-list.The European Central Bank’s (ECB) Chair of the Supervisory Board Daniele Nouy said that although she had “no clue” whether new regulatory moves on crypto would come from Europe in the future, involvement of ECB-regulated banks in the sphere was “very, very low”.“We scrutinize the issue in a regulatory perspective, we are ready to do something if it was needed, but so far it's not exactly very high on our to-do list.”It is clear that, even at a forum where these 20 nations can sit down and discuss a phenomenon like cryptocurrencies, there was never going to be a clear regulatory pathway cut out in a matter of days.The first foot in the door has already been crushed by the FSB’s refusal to explore new regulations, but, even if it had opened the dialog, there would likely be a lot of disagreeing and slow progress. In any case, we will be awaiting any developments as and when they arise.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #G20    #France    #Germany    #Russia    #China  
"Russia: State Duma Considers Law ‘On Digital Financial Assets’, Echoes US Regulations",Helen Partz,3/21/2018 1:32,22472,250,"A group of Russian deputies headed by Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, submitted a draft of federal law on cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) regulations to the State Duma, as reported in an official press release March 20.According to the press release, the documents “On Digital Financial Assets” and “On Alternative Methods of Fundraising (Crowdfunding)” were prepared in accordance with the recent instructions from president Vladimir Putin, stating that cryptocurrency regulations will become law by July 1, 2018.The bill “On Digital Financial Assets” was first introduced on Jan. 25 by the Russian Ministry of Finance. It defines cryptocurrencies and tokens as digital financial assets, allowing trading only via authorized cryptocurrency exchange operators, and establishing Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations for ICOs.The current version of the document recognizes digital assets as property, stressing that it is not a legitimate means of payment on the territory of the Russian Federation.According to financial expert Veselin Petkov, the current version of the bill “On Digital Financial Assets” has one key difference from the one proposed by the Finance Ministry in January.The current version establishes KYC regulations for customer identity verification on crypto exchanges. According to Petkov, the new legislation would echo the US requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges, in that it would also require the verification of customer accounts for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) purposes.On Feb. 24, Cointelegraph reported that nearly 13,000 Coinbase customers’ data was  handed over to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). On Dec. 27, 2017 one of the major crypto exchanges, Poloniex, announced that they will require all accounts to become verified.The Russian bill proposes the following requirements for operators of cryptocurrency exchange:“A digital wallet is opened by the operator of a digital financial assets exchange only after passing the identification procedures of the owner in accordance with the Federal Law “On combating money laundering and terrorism financing.”There is also a difference concerning ICOs in the new version of the bill. In contrast with the earlier suggested 50,000 rubles ($900) as a maximum amount of investment for unqualified investors, the bill now suggests that the maximum limit will be defined by the the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR).In January Cointelegraph reported on a disagreement between the Ministry of Finance and the CBR, who disagreed about whether cryptocurrency trading should be accepted. According to Ria Novosti, the disagreement has been finally resolved, and now the CBR is in charge of cryptocurrency exchange in the country.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Russia    #Government    #ICO    #USA    #Putin  
US Federal Trade Commission Creates Blockchain Working Group,Ana Alexandre,3/20/2018 12:16,17599,312,"The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has created a Blockchain Working Group to identify and target fraudulent schemes which affect the FTC’s consumer protection and competition missions, according to a blog post published on the agency’s website March 16.According to FTC Acting Chief Technologist Neil Chilson, the internal Blockchain Working Group intends to combine expertise and practices on one platform which will coordinate efforts in countering fraud in Blockchain and cryptocurrency-related fields.The group has “at least” three goals; building “FTC staff expertise in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology through resource sharing and by hosting outside experts”, assistance in “internal communication and external coordination on enforcement actions”, and providing a forum for discussing potential influences on the FTC’s objectives and how to respond them.“We believe this working group is an important step to ensure the FTC can continue its missions to protect consumers and promote competition in light of cryptocurrency and blockchain developments,” Neil Chilson wrote.The move follows a lawsuit brought by the FTC against four individuals who used Bitcoin in one or more fraudulent chain referral schemes. “I expect that fraudsters will repurpose old schemes to capitalize on the current glamour and mystery of cryptocurrency,” Chilson wrote.The FTC is not new to Blockchain and cryptocurrency-related affairs. In June 2015, the agency filed a cryptocurrency-related lawsuit over an app developer who hijacked consumers’ phones to mine cryptocurrency.In 2016, it brought a case against Butterfly Labs, operators of Bitcoin mining operations, for deceiving its consumers about the availability, profitability, and newness of mining machines. In March 2017, the FTC also held a public forum on Blockchain technology.Blockchain has established itself as one of the most important contemporary technological achievements, and has become recognized for its importance and potential both by business and some government entities.Earlier this month, the US State Department and Coca-Cola, in association with three other companies, announced the launch of a Blockchain-based project to fight forced labor. In Puerto Rico, the Department of Economic Development and Commerce (DDEC) plans to form an advisory council to promote Blockchain use for businesses.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA    #Government  
"Gibraltar: ‘200’ ICOs Waiting To Launch On New Blockchain Exchange, Managing Director Claims",William Suberg,3/20/2018 12:00,21576,288,"Gibraltar has already attracted “200” prospective ICOs ahead of the planned launch of its Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX), an official announced March 20.Speaking to Financial Times, GBX chief executive Nick Cowan said that companies have shown huge interest in launching token sales under the British Overseas Territory’s band-new regulated ICO environment.“GBX has to date been approached by up to 200 applicants seeking to launch their ICO through the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange,” he said.That number would almost equal the reported 210 ICOs which successfully launched in 2017, when the funding tool hit the mainstream and became a top priority for international regulators worried about fraud.Gibraltar has been eyeing the creation of a foolproof conveyor for supporting only 100% legitimate ICO offerings for some time.As plans cement, more information is slowly coming to light, Cowan noting that plans to have “accredited sponsors” draft all whitepapers have already attracted ten candidates. Three of these have already received permission to participate.GBX is further “scaling up its regulatory team to cope with the demand to ensure it hits its target of five day turnaround on ICO applications for first response,” he added.ICOs continue to face a tough landscape in many international jurisdictions. A US Congress hearing on cryptocurrencies last week yielded highly mixed responses from lawmakers, with one senator claiming 99% of startups launching ICOs were fraudulent.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Gibraltar    #Cryptocurrencies  
US President Trump Bans US Citizens From Buying Petro,Aaron Wood,3/20/2018 3:38,46515,571,"President Donald Trump of the US has banned the Venezuelan government-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro, by executive order March 19, Bloomberg reports.The ban reportedly comes as part of a campaign to put pressure on the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro. By the order, US citizens are banned from engaging in transactions using the oil-indexed digital currency.The ban frustrates the efforts of Maduro’s government to boost foreign currency reserves. The token offering accepted transactions in US dollars and euros, meaning that Venezuelan citizens could not legally participate, as there is a ban in Venezuela on buying foreign currency.The order also authorizes US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to issue regulations to enforce the executive order. The Treasury Department announced sanctions on four Venezuelan government officials earlier this year.According to Mnuchin, “President Maduro decimated the Venezuelan economy and spurred a humanitarian crisis. Instead of correcting course… the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency.”The Treasury Department further warned investors in January to avoid the Petro, calling it “another attempt to prop up the Maduro regime, while further looting the resources of the Venezuelan people.”The Petro has struggled in finding legitimacy and interest among foreign governments. Earlier this year, the Venezuelan government claimed that Poland was interested in trading food and medicine for the Petro, which was later denied by the Polish Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Cambodia however, seems to have taken inspiration from Venezuela, and is considering its own state-sponsored digital currency, Entepay, Cointelegraph reported earlier this month.",25,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Trump    #Petro    #Venezuela  
Australian Move to Legalize Bitcoin Attracts Gold and Bullion Investor,Joshua Althauser,9/4/2017 13:00,34845,564,"Queensland-based gold and silver bullion dealer Paul Engeman has started trading Bitcoin, following the move by the federal government of Australia to authorize it as a legal currency.The goods and services tax (GST) from the purchase of virtual currencies was eliminated in Australia on July 1, 2017.According to Engeman, who serves as director of the Ainslie Bullion and Reserve Vault, he began buying and selling Bitcoin in August and his business is experiencing solid demand from both new and existing customers.“We've sold gold and silver for 43 years now and those buyers are attuned to monetary assets and can see similar properties in Bitcoin. The fundamentals for what constitutes a monetary asset are the same – it must have intrinsic value and have a medium of exchange. Gold and silver have been the champions of the space for 5000 years, but Bitcoin has the same properties in that there's only 21 million of them and it's a slow process to digitally mine new ones.""The Bitcoin price has surpassed the A$6000 ($4,800) level on Sept. 1, with predictions of it likely hitting $6000 soon. The increase was mainly driven by the overall upward trend in digital currency prices that’s resulted in the growth of the cryptocurrency market capitalization by more than $170 bln.Moreover, there is also a growing acceptance and usage of Bitcoin in Australia. Businesses like cafes, real estate agencies, vehicle manufacturers, and bookshops are already accepting the virtual currency as a form of payment.Meanwhile, Brisbane high school teacher Chris Tippler claimed that he started to teach his business and economics students about digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ripple, along with bullion, as well as how to trade them.""I knew about investing from trading currency, and I was teaching them how to read graphs.

Ukraine to Decide Legal Status of Cryptocurrencies in 3 Weeks,Joshua Althauser,9/3/2017 11:15,25587,378,"The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers on the Financial Stability Board conducted a meeting in late August 2017 to tackle the legal status of virtual currencies like Bitcoin in the country. The ministers have reached an agreement to decide on the issue in three weeks.The Cabinet of Ministers is considered as the highest body of state executive authority in the country. It is under the control of the Ukrainian parliament called the Verkhovna Rada.According to the parliament’s People’s Deputy, Olexandr Danchenko, the ministers will cooperate with the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the Verkhovna Rada and the Blockchain community to resolve the issue.In his comment, the NBU Council’s deputy chairman, Tymofiy Mylovanov, said that participants in the meeting understand the importance of Blockchain and the digital currencies as disruptive technologies, as well as the need to develop the industry, provide reasonable regulatory support and protect it against unlawful actions by different bodies.Meanwhile, National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) chairperson, Timur Khromaev, said that Blockchains, Bitcoins, tokens and other technology solutions are already part of the country’s financial market and their duty is to develop an appropriate legal status to the instruments.However, in his comment, NBU acting head, Yakiv Smoliy, said that the central bank neither recognizes Bitcoin nor bans Bitcoin mining activities. He further claimed that Bitcoin does not fall into any definition that the bank uses for currencies, money surrogate and electronic money, and has not decided yet on how it will consider the virtual currency.He noted that the regulating bodies will eventually establish a definition for Bitcoin within the framework of the Financial Stability Board in the very near future.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ukraine    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Bitcoin Mining  
"IRS To Go After Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Profits, What to Expect",Lisa Froelings,9/2/2017 16:25,129303,1379,"Recent developments lead many to Bitcoin mining and investing in Bitcoin as many tend to believe that it is a great start for investment. Regulators and tax specialists are now looking into cryptocurrencies and how they should be treated when it comes to income taxation.Since there are currently no set guidelines and procedures as to how cryptocurrencies are being taxed, the recent split of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has caused many investors to wonder whether profits from Bitcoin Cash will be considered “free cash” in the eyes of the taxman.A recent report from WSJ explored the question and by the looks of it, it’s still a draw.Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency or what people describe as digital cash. It is a centralized ledger and is accessible by all parties involved from any parts of the world. The specifics of Bitcoin Cash is that the BCH is a new cryptocurrency initiated by miners and Blockchain developers in responses to scaling issues.In Bitcoin network, the verification process usually takes up to 10 to 15 minutes or even longer - a lot when you compare it to debit cards. Such slow process and often network congestion lead the developers and miners to the idea that the more people are making transactions at the same time, the more its network scalability and speed will be challenged.The mining pools agreed to integrate the technology with SegWit or the Segregated Witness.SegWit2x makes the signature and verification data even smaller. SegWit2x, however, does not fix the problem completely.In August, miners and developers initiated a hard fork which resulted in ‘split’ and born of a new currency called Bitcoin Cash. The latest version is claimed to have faster verification process and upgrades the blocks up to 8mb.Now, those who have been holding Bitcoin before the fork happened have received Bitcoin Cash equivalent to the number of Bitcoin in their wallet especially for wallets and exchanges that supported the split.While there are currently no existing guidelines as to how Bitcoin (and now Bitcoin Cash) are treated regarding taxation, according to Bitcoin.tax, what's clear with the situation is that there are applicable income taxes whenever you sell either or both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash holdings.While many Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash may think it’s “free money,” hence not necessarily taxable, the IRS thinks otherwise. Several Reddit users chimed in the issue, with one user clarifying:""The IRS has already stated that Bitcoin is treated like property. Mining is considered income. Hodling is the same as owning gold. A $0 cost basis means that you got capital for free, and if you sell it 100 percent is gains.""The treatment for cryptocurrencies can be at zero cost. If the owner sells his Bitcoin Cash and receives the 100 percent profit as capital gains income, it will be taxable.Thus, the declaration should be a normal income as part of his capital gains in 1040 Schedule D. A Bitcoin Cash owner can opt to report his BCH as income and pay the tax amount required.  According to 2014-21 Notice of IRS:""Virtual currency is treated as property for US federal tax purposes.""The principle for the General Tax for properties is also applicable to the transactions in virtual currencies.For IRS, Bitcoin is a capital asset which is also subject to short term capital gains if sold for less than twelve months or long-term capital gains if sold within a year. IRS applies the 15 percent to 20 percent tax rates as based on income.

Ripple Talks With People’s Bank of China Key to Chinese Blockchain Market,Joshua Althauser,9/2/2017 15:45,47243,713,"Recently, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has visited Coinbase and Ripple on a US research delegation having talks about the “significant” cryptocurrency issue.Welcomed China's central bank, industry & academic leaders to #Ripple HQ to discuss the latest #blockchain trends https://t.co/jL3i4yYzjoAs Bitcoin and Blockchain technology step into the more mass market adoption, many businesses are showing their interest to explore and penetrate cryptocurrency and blockchain platforms.Ripple investors are looking forward to the collaboration of Ripple and China tackling the country’s Blockchain market.Ripple is the creator and developer of the Ripple payment and exchange network. The company is based in San Francisco, California.""Ripple"" is just the rename of Opencoin. The Ripple Blockchain focuses on banks, global payments, and digital exchange.China's has a huge network or connectivity when it comes to business and consumers. It is tempting for Ripple to get involved with the Chinese market because it will be a big hit to the company.China aims to widen its connection in the global trade market and the firm growth of China's existence across ecommerce will substantially require low transaction fees, cheap and fast flow of payment system. China is known to follow strict regulations and security when it comes to banking and financial transactions. In fact, recent warnings about unregulated ICOs caused certain companies catering mainly to Chinese investors to halt their operations.Ripple's business services revolve around bank-to-bank transfers.

China is now researching on digital currency and the possibility of having its cryptocurrency.The fintech company and the China's Central Bank officials are having talks about the public Blockchain platform RCL or what they call Ripple Consensus Ledger.The delegation is to promote financial tech between China and the United States. Ripple had a presentation with the officials specifically on the nature of the public Blockchain, global payment ecosystem, and how they will benefit in applying the principle of Blockchain platform- its offer of low service fees, and fast pace of real-time transactions.Though there is no official announcement yet about the expanding business of China Central Bank and Ripple, people are looking forward to the great news and collaboration of the two entities ahead.",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Ripple    #ICO    #Coinbase    #OpenCoin    #Markets  
National Internet Finance Association of China Issues ICO Warning to Members,Joshua Althauser,9/2/2017 15:20,17117,185,"The self-regulatory group National Internet Finance Association of China has warned its members about the dangers in participating in initial coin offerings (ICO). The group claimed that ICOs could be using misleading information as part of fundraising campaigns.In a statement in late August 2017, the online finance organization further warned its member companies to exercise extreme caution when dealing with the new fundraising mechanism.Part of the statement reads:""China Internet Finance Association members should take the initiative to strengthen self-discipline, to resist illegal financial behavior.""The National Internet Finance Association of China was created by the People’s Bank of China in 2016 to serve as a partner of government agencies in tackling regulatory issues and developments.The group has more than 400 members that include financial institutions such as banks, securities companies and consumer finance firms, as well as other organizations like guarantee companies, Internet peer-to-peer firms and credit services. Among the companies were peer-to-peer wealth management firm CreditEase, Lufax and Wangxin.The People’s Bank of China has been strictly monitoring the operations of ICOs lately. As part of its scrutiny, the central bank is drafting regulations that could mandate the suspension of all ICO activities in the country.Based on the proposed rules issued by the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, digital currency-based funding activities are possible targets for investigations.The draft also outlined that an interdepartmental committee shall be created by the government to fight or stop illegal fundraising. It clarified that all participants of such activities shall be responsible for their own losses.Meanwhile, several local ICO projects seem to be taking precautionary measures. One of them is the ICO website ICOINFO, which announced the temporary suspension of its activities due to regulatory uncertainties whereas companies such as NEO tend to be regulatory-friendly and likely to benefit from stricter rules.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #China    #Government    #Policies    #Central Bank  
NEO To Benefit from Chinese ICO Regulations,Joshua Althauser,9/2/2017 2:22,58604,1579,"Dubbed as the “Chinese Ethereum,” NEO could possibly benefit over the long term with Chinese regulatory rules on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).The Chinese government’s regulations on ICOs stem from public outrage over the large number of pyramid schemes in the country. China is set to decide on the proposed ICO regulatory measures this September following public consultations.The regulations will focus on various fundraising activities in China, including Initial Coin Offerings. If these proposed regulations are made into law, they will likely help boost NEO since the regulated ICO market will give investors confidence.That proposition was stipulated in a Reddit article by bentylerlive.Since NEO originated in China and already abides by the proposed rules, NEO would be associated with quality and functionality. China’s first public Blockchain could become China’s premier digital platform.This sentiment was echoed by one commenter who opined that regulations are inevitable and will cause a dip across all Blockchain-based assets. The end result, he believes, will be a stronger and more sustainable market. Another Reddit user said the move will surely solidify investors’ trust and ultimately lead to better organized and more transparent projects.The statement posted on Reddit reads in part:“First off, to all the people who think China will ban ICO's: That's simply not going to happen. It would make a lot of very rich people angry in China. Let me explain.Having specific rules in place gives the market a sense of permanency and legitimacy. It reassures many investors in China that the Chinese government is watching very closely for cases of fraud, and will react in order to[sic] protect the public. That's bullish for NEO. Incoming regulations were inevitable. Even if they weren't, we still don't want a series of low quality ICO's clogging up the NEO platform. NEO should be associated with quality and functionality, first and foremost. Like all of you, I look forward to NEO becoming the premier digital platform led by the fine folks in China, and now we are one step closer to that goal.”It is apparent that soon ICOs will need more than just marketing blitz--they’ll need to be compliant.",9,  #Altcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #NEO    #China    #ICO    #Investments  
Lawyer at Firm Advising Winklevoss Twins Tapped as SEC’s ETF Regulator,David Dinkins,9/1/2017 16:55,18224,227,"Dalia Blass of the Ropes & Gray law firm has been tapped to head the SEC’s Division of Investment Management which regulates, and approves or disapproves, exchange traded funds (ETFs). Blass’ firm, Ropes & Gray, represents the Winklevoss twins in their efforts to create a Bitcoin ETF.The SEC famously rejected two Bitcoin ETF proposals earlier this year, citing largely unregulated markets. They did leave themselves an out, however. The Commission indicated that in the event that a regulated futures market for Bitcoin were developed, they might reconsider. Not long ago, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) gave LedgerX permission to create such a futures market.The SEC agreed to hear an appeal from the Winklevoss twins earlier this year, but few watchers expected the twins to receive a different answer. With Blass at the helm and regulated futures markets being developed, however, this could change.An “exchange traded fund” sounds like something arcane that would only be of interest to high-flying Wall Street types, but it’s actually relatively simple. An ETF tracks the value of an underlying asset or class of assets and is required to buy and sell the underlying asset as shares of the ETF are bought and sold.ETFs are a convenient way to expose oneself to certain assets that may be difficult to own. For instance, most people don’t have a huge tank in the backyard to store oil or natural gas. If somebody wants to invest in oil and gas but doesn’t want to own and store the actual commodity itself, they can purchase shares of an oil and gas ETF.A Bitcoin ETF could open Bitcoin investing to an entirely new class: institutional investors. It is currently difficult for institutions to invest in Bitcoin. Various mutual funds, hedge funds and pension funds have specific rules about the types of assets they are allowed to own.Institutions are typically allowed to own ETFs, but may not be allowed to own the underlying asset. Bitcoin is difficult to store, requiring both absolute security and adequate backups. Many interested investors are either unwilling or unable to buy and store Bitcoin, but would like exposure to the asset itself. An ETF is quite useful for this purpose.It’s also extremely challenging to hold actual Bitcoin in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs. A Bitcoin ETF would make that much easier since ETFs can be bought and sold just like regular stocks. At the present time, the only way (for most people) to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a tax-advantaged account is to buy shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, listed as GBTC. However, because of high demand and limited supply, GBTC shares trade at a huge premium. Until this morning, the premium was a little over 100 percent. Each GBTC share is “backed” by about 0.09 Bitcoin, yet the shares trade at prices far more than the underlying Bitcoin value.Indeed, following the news about Blass and a critical article by investor Andrew Left caused shares of GBTC to tumble by 25 percent.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ETF    #SEC    #Investments  
Israeli Government Announces New ICO Scrutiny,Jon Buck,8/31/2017 7:45,9402,255,"The Israeli government has recently announced, through the Israeli Securities Authority panel, that it will begin scrutinizing ICOs more carefully and may potentially regulate them.The Securities Authority head, Prof. Shmuel Hauser, has announced the formation of a committee to evaluate whether ICOs fall within the definition of a security as established by the Israeli government.Further, the committee has been tasked with making an analysis of cryptocurrency regulations in other countries in order to evaluate the legitimacy of Bitcoin. The committee’s mandate is to create new regulatory policies which encourage alternative funding channels and technological innovation while at the same time protecting investors from unsupervised investments.Udi Wertheimer, a digital wallet employee, pointed out the substantial policy shift via Twitter:Looks like @coindesk and others missed this: Israel today announced it'll investigate whether ICO tokens are securities. This is *big*: 1/n pic.twitter.com/d7KzcY9D7KThe Israeli announcement brings additional threats of government control in Israel, where many ICOs have been started.

Tips for Investors: How to Protect Yourselves Against Possible Fraud Schemes,Kshitish Balhotra,8/30/2017 17:40,17125,251,"Today the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rolled out an investor alert which advises investors to be careful of trading in the stock of public companies claiming to be related to or asserting they are engaging in, Initial Coin Offerings (or ICOs).This is the latest twist in the ICO saga where the earlier alerts were more focused on addressing the token sale offerings made by startups or non-public companies.With this increased focus from the regulators, we may very well see much more detailed oversight of these potential offerings and maturing of the market to ensure that quality projects with high-quality development teams are funded using this new investment mechanism.It remains to be seen though as to how the future steps are planned by the regulators to ensure that all these offerings continue to abide by the laws of the land and investor community does not suffer.The SEC has detailed the below-mentioned tips for investors which are meant to educate the public against possible fraud schemes and help protect investor interest. The advice has been reproduced below from the bulletin for readers ease.Look out for these warning signs of possible microcap fraud:In the past month the SEC has ordered stock trading freezes of the publicly traded companies namely First Bitcoin Capital Corp., CIAO Group, Strategic Global and Sunshine Capital.All of these firms have seen changing hands multiple times and have publicly stated plans for potential cryptocurrency offerings and ICOs before the SEC took note and ordered the stock trading freeze.With the explosive growth in the ICOs, regulators around the world have started taking note and issued advisories to better educate investors about the potential securities laws violations.Regulators in US, Canada and Singapore have issued specific guidelines in this regards to help investors better understand what constitutes as securities and what doesn't.The regulators are specifically wary of pump and dump schemes whereby certain coin offerings may be used specifically to inflate their price post offering so that vested interests could then dump them at a profit.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Investments    #SEC    #Tokens    #ICO    #Tradings  
"SEC Details Reasons For ICO ‘Suspensions,’ Warns About Pump-And-Dump",William Suberg,8/29/2017 12:10,12973,213,"The US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) has issued a warning about ICOs and reasons it could “suspend” them in future.A circular from the regulator’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy Monday focuses on “potential scams involving stock of companies claiming to be related to, or asserting they are engaging in” ICOs.In the bulletin, the SEC highlights three reasons it could “suspend trading” for “public interest” if an ICO provider is found to have fallen short of the law.These are:“A lack of current, accurate, or adequate information about the company – for example, when a company has not filed any periodic reports for an extended period;Questions about the accuracy of publicly available information, including in company press releases and reports, about the company’s current operational status and financial condition; orQuestions about trading in the stock, including trading by insiders, potential market manipulation, and the ability to clear and settle transactions in the stock.”The update follows legislative clarifications from the SEC last month, in which it stated it would look at tokens on a case-by-case basis to establish whether or not each constitutes a security under its jurisdiction.In an explicit nod to some of the more volatile tokens which have entered the market this year, the SEC references “pump-and-dump” methods as something investors should be wary of.These “involve the effort to manipulate a stock’s share price or trading volume by touting the company’s stock through false and misleading statements to the marketplace,” it adds.This week also saw Chinese authorities hint at possible full-on suspensions of ICOs if ongoing research finds them to present “large risk” by design.The perspective is reminiscent of China’s approach to exchange regulation earlier this year, in which inspections also found discrepancies with the law, leading to a several-month shutdown for the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #SEC    #China  
Bitcoin Miners in Russia ‘In Talks’ To Get Spare Energy From Energy Firms,William Suberg,8/29/2017 10:05,11028,298,"In a further twist to Russia’s complex approach to cryptocurrency, power plants have begun selling excess capacity to Bitcoin miners.As local news outlet Daily Storm reports Monday, the country’s largest energy providers Gazprom and EuroSibEnergo are currently “in talks” with “tens” of miners looking to take advantage of cheap electricity prices.“No contracts have been finalized so far, but the company (EuroSibEnergo) is not declining partnership opportunities,” reports state.An interactive map shows around 70 “potential” locations miners could use to benefit from spare capacity.The developments run in contrast with cryptocurrency’s plight at regulatory level in Russia this week.Cointelegraph reported Monday that senior finance officials plan to ban sales of cryptoassets such as Bitcoin to private individuals.Only “qualified investors” should have access to such assets, deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev told TV channel Rossiya 24, adding he thought it was “hard to argue against” cryptocurrency being a “pyramid scheme.”At the same time, a new business co-owned by the Kremlin’s Internet ombudsman is seeking to raise around $100 mln to corner the Bitcoin mining market and challenge Chinese dominance.Like the miners looking to Gazprom and EuroSibEnergo, state participants want to use Russia’s cheaper energy rates to give China large-scale competition.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Bitcoin Mining    #China  
China ICO ‘Suspension’ Warning Echoes Regulator Treatment Of Exchanges,William Suberg,8/29/2017 9:55,13684,431,"The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is reportedly considering a blanket ban on ICOs if lawmakers find “large risks” to consumers.According to reports from a meeting earlier this month by local news outlet Tencent, the PBoC is actively assessing possible limits on ICO activities in China.A source told the publication that the meeting included participation from the country’s Securities and Futures Commission, and Banking Regulatory Commission among others.Among the tools under consideration are controlling the size of ICOs, beefing up requirements for disclosure of information and more overt warnings about the risks associated with investing.“In addition, if a large risk is found (for investors), the regulator will suspend all activities associated with ICOs and address them,” Tencent stated.The warnings echo a similar tone from the PBoC on cryptocurrency exchanges themselves earlier this year. After investigatory measures, regulators shut down Chinese exchanges for multiple weeks in order to put new legislative framework in place.While exchanges are now compliant with demands, ICOs still operate in a legal gray area in China, which has led to warnings over the potential punishments for those participating in sales not to authorities’ liking.The PBoC gave notice of its intention to regulate the ICO market in June.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Banks    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China  
Vietnamese PM Approves Plan to Authorize Bitcoin As Form of Payment,Joshua Althauser,8/26/2017 18:35,38977,877,"Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has reportedly authorized a plan that could lead to the official recognition of digital currencies like Bitcoin as a form of payment in the country by 2018.Based on a report by regional news services VNA, the prime minister has ordered the country’s central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Public Safety to study and draft a legal framework to regulate virtual currencies.The assessment process is due for completion in August 2018. The preparation of legal documents needed for the recognition of cryptocurrencies under a regulatory framework should also be finalized by the end of the year.Simultaneously, Vietnamese officials are mandated to work on a taxation system for digital currencies. The system, which will determine how virtual currency users in the country will be taxed, is due for implementation in June 2019.Moreover, proposals on how to prevent and handle violations concerning the use of cryptocurrencies should be submitted for approval by September of the same year.The plan also calls for the amendment of the 2015 Civil Code’s property rights provisions to include rules aimed at safeguarding Vietnam’s property rights. The amendment is expected to improve the protection of the rights and interests of both domestic and foreign investors.The latest moves by the Vietnamese government to embrace digital currencies are a complete turnaround from the cautious viewpoint it expressed in 2014.During that time, the country’s central bank has strongly warned consumers against the use of the cryptocurrencies. It reiterated that users would have no protection if they suffer investment losses.

Canada Looking To Classify Digital Currencies As Securities,Darryn Pollock,8/25/2017 14:50,8620,251,"In studying a number of cryptocurrencies and upcoming ICOs, Canadian authorities have said that the offerings are similar to the sale of securities and as such should have to abide by the tough rules that exist around them - or seek exemptions.While digital currencies boom and ICOs pop up with huge regularity across the globe, governments and regulators are trying to incorporate them into an existing legal framework.Regulators are trying to keep up with the growth in order to create rules to govern them within their borders, while also not stifling the innovative funding model.The Canadian Securities Administers, an umbrella group of provincial watch-dogs, has noted that any token whose value is tied to future profits or success of a business should be considered a security.This obviously seems to encapsulate ICOs whose value is indeed set and determined by future profiteering and success.The regulators said in a statement:“With the offerings that we have reviewed to date, we have in many instances found that the coins/tokens in question constitute securities for the purposes of securities laws, including because they are investment contracts.”The statement released by the regulators has been labeled as unclear and a little ambiguous, although full of threat and menace.It has prompted some of Canada’s leading fintech executive to criticize and seek clarity from the Canadian Securities Administrators.“There still is a lot of gray area in terms of the guidance on when a cryptocurrency or token would be a security,” said Daniel Fuke, a partner in the securities and M&A group at Fasken Martineau.“It would be nice if we could know from CSA what they were thinking in terms of some of the sub-considerations of the securities law test.”South of the border, in the US, their securities authority already made a big call when it announced that Blockchain companies must obey federal laws because of the DOA incident.In essence, ICOs would be controlled by these securities laws unless a valid exemption could apply.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Canada    #Security    #Cryptocurrency Community    #ICO

South African Tax Services Researching Ways to Track BTC Transactions,Darryn Pollock,12/14/2017 21:25,12965,275,"Regulators, governments and tax men alike have been stumped as to how to keep up with the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market. It has seen a large grey area appear over the market in which incidents are usually handled as they come.To this end, the South African Revenue Service, the taxation body of the country, is seeking help from top technology companies from around the world in order to try and track Bitcoin transactions.This attempt by the South African Revenue Service (SARS) could potentially open up a can of worms as the right to privacy is instilled deeply in Bitcoins transparent, yet anonymous, transactions.It was reported that only 802 people paid taxes on their Bitcoin gains in the US back in September as the IRS had little option but to ask for people to be honest in their tax returns.This extends to most countries as it stands as there is still no precedent for forcing people to reveal their transactions.Banks are required to supply SARS, and other tax institutions across other countries, with information on the investments of their clients for verification purposes, but in a crypto environment such information is lacking.This leaves the revenue service in a tight spot that is only getting tighter as more people enter the cryptomarket.Dr. Randall Carolissen, SARS group executive for research, admits that they are looking into options to track Bitcoin transactions.“As you can imagine it is very difficult – the Blockchain technology. Without revealing too much – we are talking to some of the top technology companies in the world that are doing similar work for Canada and the UK and we are hoping to get that technology.”The issue really is that there is a right to privacy that is enshrined in Bitcoin, and that will be hard for any institution to break into - legally. Bitcoin’s transactions are transparent, yet anonymous, but that anonymity is not total.With no set precedent available yet on how to monitor transactions on this decentralized system, tax services and other regulators will need to come up with a solution on their own.The problem is that because it is decentralized, no one can come to their aide from the side of Bitcoin. Transactions are maintained openly on the Blockchain, but when it comes to tying those transactions to a person and enforcing taxation on it, it is still a very dark area for regulators.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Africa    #Taxes    #Transactions    #Privacy  
South Korea's Largest Bitcoin Exchanges Ready For Strict Regulations,Joseph Young,12/14/2017 12:31,22445,257,"South Korea’s largest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit are ready for the imposition of strict regulatory frameworks by the local government and financial authorities.Yesterday, Dec. 13, the South Korean government revealed the details of the emergency cryptocurrency meeting it had held on Dec. 12. South Korean financial authorities stated that in the coming weeks underaged investors and foreigners will not be allowed to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market.By next week the South Korean government is expected to roll out a few regulatory frameworks focused on investor protection and taxation. One of the policies currently being discussed is the possibility of equally distributing the daily trading volumes of cryptocurrency exchanges across the market and implementing stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies.Bithumb, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange with a larger daily trading volume than the country’s main stock exchange KOSDAQ, said that it welcomes regulations from the local government, as it would further legitimize, stabilize, and validate the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market. Bithumb said:”A good set of regulations will nurture the (virtual currency) market, and we would welcome that.”For many years the South Korean government was hesitant towards regulating the local cryptocurrency market and industry, as it believed that any form of regulation would lead general consumers to consider it as an endorsement and validation of the space.However, the South Korean government has admitted that the market has become far too big for it to dismiss and has revealed its plans to follow the regulations of other leading markets such as Japan and the US in the long-term. A spokesperson said of a cryptocurrency task force formed by the government:“The South Korean government has no other choice but to follow the regulatory frameworks and trends established by other leading governments. While there certainly exists a negative reputation attached to cryptocurrencies, the government’s stance is to allow what has to be allowed, for the benefit of the South Korean market.”The South Korean government and the country’s central bank are concerned over two main trends in the local market: underaged investors engaging in cryptocurrency trading and the emergence of multi-million dollar ponzi schemes.Last week, Cointelegraph reported that everyone in the traditional finance sector in South Korea is rushing to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Tens of thousands of middle to high school students and college students are said to be trading cryptocurrencies on a daily basis, frequently creating trades, orders and checking the price trend of the market during classes.The South Korean government and its prime minister Lee Nak-Yeon expressed their concerns over such trends and ultimately enforced a ban on trading for underaged investors.Another issue with the South Korean market is the growing size of ponzi schemes. Last month, a $200 mln cryptocurrency-related ponzi scheme was discovered; its operators coaxed investors with a hefty monthly return and stole the funds of the investors.Due to the lack of regulations and policies in South Korea, the state of the local cryptocurrency market remains premature. The aim of the South Korean government is to lead potential investors into the strictly regulated cryptocurrency exchange market, rather than unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) markets which are prone and vulnerable to ponzi schemes.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Bithumb  
Belarus Signs ‘Super Liberal’ Blockchain Support Legislation,William Suberg,12/12/2017 16:00,21378,292,"Belarus’ president Aleksandr Lukashenko has formally signed a “super liberal” bill signaling state support of Blockchain and cryptocurrency.As local news outlet Dev.by and others report today, Lukashenko set the wheels of Belarus’ so-called “Digital Economy Growth” package rolling Monday.The legislation aims to remove bureaucracy which could potentially hinder Blockchain’s implementation, and gives the go-ahead to a permissive environment for cryptocurrency exchange.In addition, Belarus’ ‘HTP’ - a Silicon Valley-style tech haven Lukashenko created - will have privileges extending to attracting funding through ICOs and using cryptocurrency in civil circulation, Cointelegraph previously reported last month.“Today’s ratification of the digital economy by the president: the decree will be signed by the end of this year, and is a super liberal version with 100 percent absence of bureaucracy for supporting all forms of Blockchain adoption,” one IT industry insider close to the president wrote on Facebook following completion.The Digital Economy takes Belarus a step beyond its neighbors in the race to incorporate emerging disruptive technologies. Russia, for example, has had a problematic road to adoption of cryptocurrency, with conflicting statements creating an uncertain picture of their future legal status.Kazakhstan, on the other hand, has increasingly taken steps towards its stated goal of becoming the “Blockchain Singapore.”",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Belarus    #Government    #Kazakhstan  
ICOs Have Entered Intensive Care,Nick Ayton,12/10/2017 14:25,24248,0,"Yet the remedy proposed by regulators may actually kill the patient.Our London correspondent Nick Ayton aka The Sage of Shoreditch, after chairing Blockchain Expo in the heart of Silicon Valley, assess the state of ICOs and the near-term prognosis appears to suggest that in 75 percent of cases we are losing the patient.12,000 people attended Blockchain Expo in Silicon Valley on 29 and 30 Nov. 2017, to date one of the biggest gathering of crypto enthusiasts, which provided a large enough sample of people in the ecosystem to measure the current temperature of ICOs as an emerging capital market.There is no doubt ICOs are entering a period of intensive care but should emerge fitter and stronger in the second half of 2018.There are several factors affecting the health of the patient that are inflicted by the many ills of founding teams who suffer from very similar symptoms: poor listening skills, delusion and over ambition. The main issue stems from founders remaining in complete denial of current laws and regulations because they are in Blockchain now.There is a dangerous trend with founders pushing on regardless, relying on thin and often very ‘doggie’ legal advice, and where in some cases the law firms have naively followed the Howie test and concluded the ‘token’ is a Utility token. Ignoring crowdfunding, banking and unaware they are creating unregulated financial products where the token is clearly designed as a pooling instrument, the sole purpose to gather funds for a project. Under any definition a security!We are seeing the end of the Bootstrap projects replaced by business people who see the ICO light that comes with established companies, real customers and revenues. That puts them in the prime position of being able to afford increasingly expensive ICO processes where costs have more than quadrupled in the past 6 months.With the CME announcement and the emergence of ICO platforms that cater for security tokens offering a regulated governance approach, new crypto funds, emerging ETFs and new exchanges that combine old capital markets with crypto; there is now an ‘on ramp’ for institutional investors, high net-worth and VCs all itching to join in. The operate on the hunch that just a small strip of crypto in their investment mix will drag the mundane performances of 99 percent of funds above market returns without having to do anything.The spike in Bitcoin price is therefore no coincidence as people start to wake up and big money joins the queue to buy Bitcoin (and Ether), and why the underlying network performances in recent weeks have been slowing considerably. At the time of writing this BTC is approaching $14,000.The main barrier to entry is the way in which ICOs are currently constructed. Infamous White Papers that promises to deliver a lot without any proper governance or pressure on the founders to actually deliver what was so clearly promised. In the next evolution of the ICO process we will see White Papers look more like an Investment Memorandum and Prospectus (the regulators intention) than the lightweight commentary we see today. Why:The volume of ICO projects has not abated and each month we will see a continuing stream of new projects all chasing fewer ICO investors where the pool of crypto enthusiasts (investors) is not growing at the same rate as ICO projects. And people are holding ETH and BTC.While reported numbers of downloaded wallets suggest the number is 30 million, in reality it is both more and less. More wallets that support social impact programs who don’t yet invest, and the new wallet holders who have woken up, that buy and hold and don’t yet invest. And the popular wallets such as Coinbase and MEW.The crypto market is expanding fast but not enough to keep pace with the sheer number of ICOs.The biggest factors for the high ICO failure rates remains founder naivety and ignorance, where they think their project is the ‘nuts’ and everyone wants to be involved coupled with bad advisors and advice, setting an unusually high Soft Cap that sets them up for failure and humiliation. ICOs failing to meet the Soft Cap will hurt adoption as the refunds take time to happen and sow the seeds of doubt.The majority of ICO ‘fails’ are projects with just an idea, as they want to raise money in pre-ICOs to build the idea and pay for an ICO.  They are simply not sufficiently developed and come across as such. Asking for investors (token buyers) to give them money to develop the concept?  Without considering what is in it for investors? Or why would they part with ETH at $460 in exchange for a token linked to a project that isn’t sufficiently defined? In the past, investors have funded founders’ ideas from early crypto profits, who in most cases have played a waiting game for founders to deliver something, anything, as they are powerless and see their token dump.The smart money is increasingly drawn to projects where there is something to see, a prototype, MVP or in many cases a fairly complete solution that provides the investor with confidence there is something tangible to the project, that demonstrates the potential ‘pot of gold’ down the road at least… Although some founders think issuing a utility token is enough, and expect investors to become interested users of the platform itself.I have mentioned before investors are looking for a return, to be able to get in and cash out. Different from project fans who are happy to buy the tokens, or earn them and then spend them on the platform to be an integral part of the new ecosystem.Companies with real revenues, customers and founders tend to be geared up to meet the needs of the new ICO investors and the shift from the crowd to the institution. As Greshams Laws reinterpreted, Bad money pushes out Good.When assessing an ICO’s state of readiness you have to look at the underlying data which tells the level of interest in a project.  I speak with many founders that have a decent project and think a few weeks’ marketing will draw in enough of an audience to raise many millions. Whilst some projects can, normally pumped by a celeb, key management team or advisor that raises the profile, the majority of projects aren’t this lucky. Insufficient marketing budgets, poor content and being late to the party hurts so many ICOs and reduces the amount raised. Good projects miss out.It takes a good eight to twelve weeks at least to get the story out into investor communities. Ideally the team should have been building a following since the projects’ inception, leading to large numbers of social media follows and driving traffic to the website, and then the ICO website. Requiring tens of thousands of hits per week that indicated a state of readiness, to press that ICO Go Button.You just won’t hit your Soft Cap with 500 on Telegram, 100 website hits a day, 1000 Twitter followers and putting out a little bit of content every day. Volume matters and it amazes me when founders think that as soon as they launch there will be a frenzy towards their project. There won’t be!Not leaving enough time for the PR and marketing to propagate is a hard but common lesson to learn.I am constantly amazed by projects that push ahead launching a token that is a security without a care in the world. No KYC or even acknowledgement of the need to find out information about the investor or token buyer.“My token is not a security” is their answer. Or: “Our lawyer, our advisor said so. We pass the Howie test confirming our token is a Utility token. In any case we can complete an exemption form after the event under 506 and this will suffice.”All good then.The goon show is most entertaining when the reality of what the founders have done is explained and the situation they are in becomes clear. Investors wont buy tokens that are securities and not declared as such, and if they do residual Class Actions can result in project collapse..Then there are simply poorly conceived projects where founders want to reinvent Blockchain, take on Visa, solve world peace and global famine, and others that want to launch a token that don’t explain the underlying Blockchain and why it is needed. At this point the lunatics are most definitely in control of the asylum.New tokens have no liquidity and exchanges don’t take on new tokens these days. Investors are now aware liquidity is key. The exchanges that are listing tokens that are securities will need to rethink their core business model as new exchanges engineered to handle tokens that are specifically engineered as securities, along with pre-screening investors during ICOs and for secondary market activities.We should expect some exchanges in 2018 to close or not list any new tokens.ICOs in their current form cannot survive 2018, and the label of the ‘wild west’ will be replaced by an ICO process that looks more conventional as regulators cut off crowd investor channels, either banning or limiting ICO activity, and wanting to know the owners of wallets.In reality one shouldn’t be surprised as buying a token (a financial product) that promises a return, entitlement, voting and other value-related attributes is bound to attract attention, and will require a proper Investment Memorandum approach, a Prospectus with commitments, projections and an explanation of use of funds against milestones, and supporting investor reporting and governance structures.Those pumping the token (financial product) whether PR and Marketing, the founder team and staff or another third party will not be allowed to promote, sell or market socalled Security tokens that are in realty like any other financial product.Is this all part of the master plan of governments and regulators to squeeze out the crowd using the excuse of protecting the investor or the sub plot to protect banks and capital  markets in which their pay packets, futures and allegiances depend?Let’s not forget ICOs are not the only secret sauce of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Blockchain helps us remove the centre. Makes things tamper proof. Returns trust that has been stripped from businesses since 2008. It is time to build new banks, payment systems and a new range of financial products, platforms and ways of doing things; and use the current rules and regulations to bring the entire system down.Bitcoin is already a reserve currency for some, a safe haven for others, a protected value. It helps pay back losses to people who were robbed during 2008 while regulators stood back and let it continue.ICOs will mature. They still offer new options. And while the patient needs some oxygen, he is not yet written off. Token sales are part of a new Capital Market, we have to show we can keep our own house in order!",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Bitcoin Adoption    #London    #Blockchain Expo    #Silicon Valley  
"IRS Bitcoin Hunt Ramps Up, But Tax Amnesty Could Follow: Expert Blog",Robert W. Wood,12/10/2017 13:50,55082,0,"Expert Blog is Cointelegraph’s new series of articles by crypto industry leaders. It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.Don’t get excited or fearful just yet. The IRS has not yet announced a tax amnesty for people who failed to report their gains and income from Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. But there has long been speculation that it might happen. And given recent developments, we may now be one step closer.It is well-known that the IRS is looking hard at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions, hoping to scoop up some tax dollars. Frighteningly, much of the IRS attention now appears to be focused on the criminal end of the spectrum. IRS Criminal Investigation Agents evidently are being trained in the field.The IRS Criminal Investigation Division not only ordered training for its agents. It also entered into a contract with Chainanalysis for tracking. We may expect this area to unfold materially in the coming years and not in a happy way.A Justice Department attorney recently noted that IRS scrutiny on tax reporting could prompt new procedures for users to get right with the IRS. Mark F. Daly, senior litigation counsel in the Justice Department Tax Division, made the remarks in a Nov. 3, 2017 symposium held by the State Bar of Texas Tax Section. It was released by webcast on Nov. 9.Mr. Daly also noted the widely publicized statistic that only 807 people reported Bitcoin to the IRS between 2013 and 2015. In contrast, there are hundreds of thousands of Coinbase account holders and climbing all the time. The sheer transaction volume of all those property transactions is frankly staggering. The IRS is not blind to this.Then there is the Coinbase summons case, mentioned below. There have been more than a few comparisons raised with the Swiss and other offshore bank controversies. For models on special amnesty programs, the IRS has good examples. The Swiss bank controversies of a decade back prompted two programs, and they are both still in existence.If you have undisclosed offshore accounts or income, you can enter the IRS program called the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, or OVDP. It involves filing up to eight years of amended tax returns, other disclosure forms, and paying taxes, interest and penalties. But it is formulaic get out of jail free card. What’s more, you can fix your other tax problems too, even if they have nothing to do with offshore income or accounts.For less serious offshore tax problems, the second IRS program is called the Streamlined program. It involves only three amended tax returns, up to six years of FBAR foreign account reports, and paying taxes and interest you owe. The penalties are much smaller than the OVDP. Moreover, if you live outside the US, you don’t even pay any penalties in the Streamlined program.These could be helpful blueprints. Way back in 2013, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) said that the IRS needed to ramp up for digital currencies. The IRS started watching such issues in 2007. In 2009, the IRS posted information on its website on the tax consequences of virtual economy transactions.However, other than the 2014 “it is property” notice, the IRS has not provided taxpayers with more information. Some kind of amnesty seems almost inevitable, eventually. After all, IRS efforts to find untaxed offshore funds hidden in offshore accounts were wildly successful. Some of it was clearly hardball. The IRS has prosecuted big foreign banks for helping Americans stash money and assets overseas. The IRS collected handsome and in some cases punitive settlements.The IRS has also prosecuted high-profile individuals for hiding their money in offshore accounts. The IRS used whistleblowers and foreign bankers who had to take deals or go down with the ship. The IRS also strong-armed foreign governments, as well as foreign banks to make them turn over more data about US taxpayers holding accounts overseas.But perhaps the greatest coup in the IRS’s strategy was a type of limited amnesty. The IRS has won big. It has collected more than $10 bln in these efforts. The money train isn’t done yet either. Remember, it all started with the John Doe Summons to UBS, the Swiss bank. It was a John Doe Summons against Coinbase too.Both the IRS and Coinbase have declared partial victories in that dispute. But some records are going to start flowing like a river. US Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled that the exchange must supply the tax agency with the identities of all users in the US who conducted at least one Bitcoin transaction equivalent to at least $20,000 between 2012 and 2015. The order says that a ""reporting gap"" gave the IRS legitimate reason to demand the information.Magistrate Corley wrote in her judgment:""That only 800 to 900 taxpayers reported gains related to Bitcoin in each of the relevant years and that more than 14,000 Coinbase users have either bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000 worth of Bitcoin in a given year suggests that many Coinbase users may not be reporting their Bitcoin gains.""With the order, Coinbase will be required to turn over the names, addresses and tax identification numbers on 14,355 account holders out of its nearly six mln customers. The UBS release that started the Swiss avalanche was only 4,250 names. The Court has ordered Coinbase to produce the following customer information: (a) taxpayer ID number, (b) name, (c) birth date, (d) address, (e) records of account activity, including transaction logs or other records identifying the date, amount, and type of transaction (purchase/sale/exchange), the post transaction balance, and the names of counterparties to the transaction and (f) all periodic statements of account or invoices (or the equivalent).This has to be at least unnerving to affected taxpayers. At least this information is limited to those accounts with at least $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year from 2013 to 2015. No other records must be produced now. Still, it seems highly unlikely that this is the end of the story, with Coinbase or more generally.Bitcoin values have gone meteoric. It seems likely that the IRS will start formulating some way to offer carrots to taxpayers who have not been reporting their Bitcoin and other digital currency gains. So, stay tuned. In the meantime, the latest in the Coinbase saga can be read here.Bio: Robert W. Wood is a tax lawyer with a nationwide practice in the US.

Governments Using Crypto as a Reason to Spy on Us,Gareth Jenkinson,12/10/2017 13:00,46361,0,"Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin pioneered the way for cryptocurrencies and has boomed into mainstream consciousness in 2017. Blockchain technology promises liberation from centralized banking, but its anonymous nature also puts it in the sights of government and security agencies.A prime example is the now defunct Silk Road, which was an online marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell everything from drugs and guns, to information, for Bitcoin.Obviously buying and selling illegal goods will land you in a world of trouble if you are caught. This truly is the dark side of the cryptocurrency world, which allows drug dealers and the illegal arms trade an anonymous and untraceable way of doing business.The FBI shut Silk Road down and arrested it’s founder Ross Ulbricht, ending the run of the biggest player in the dark web’s trading history. Ironically, one of the investigating agents was found guilty of stealing Bitcoin from Silk Road while he was investigating the online platform.While it's understandable that anonymous transactions allows nefarious people to do their dirty business, even the European Union believes that cryptocurrencies are not favourable for terrorism.In a report released earlier this year, a European commision declared that terrorist groups need fiat currencies to operate. The intrinsic complexity of Blockchain transactions is a factor; so is the publicly available ledger. Every transaction made with Bitcoin is recorded on the ledger for all to see - which gives authorities some idea of who is sending who what.It's far easier to send cold, hard cash in an envelope than through digital currency, which is inevitably traceable in some way or form.Terrorism has been a threat to civilised society for decades and governments have done their utmost to snuff out the most significant threats.There is no doubt that terrorist groups pose a danger to society, but the truth is that the threat of terrorism has also been used as an excuse to spy on the general populace and invade foreign countries.Following the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York in 2001, America rescinded into Marshall Law and ultimately invaded Afghanistan to confront the Taliban head on.Since then the US has grown into a massive security state - and it was only a matter of time until the likes of the National Security Agency were caught spying on the American people.This example is one of the most recent and well known instances of a government actively spying on their own citizens, using the threat of terrorism to infringe on the privacy and rights of their people.This is probably the biggest concern for governments and their respective revenue services. Massive efforts are being made to follow up on cryptocurrency users that have failed to declare their earnings.American exchange Coinbase was ordered to hand over the details of their biggest users trading details as the US tax man looks to clamp down on tax evasion.This week, Australia ordered that all exchanges operating in the country to register with its anti-money laundering agency.These are understandable concerns but a line needs to be drawn in the sand. Earnings made on investments are taxable and people need to understand that.But making wild and unsubstantiated claims about the nefarious uses of cryptocurrencies as a reason to spy on and demand user information is wrong.People should use cryptocurrencies responsibly, but we also need to be wary of authorities misusing power to force new and unfounded regulations on the most important technological development of the 21st century.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Terrorism    #Cryptocurrencies    #Silk Road    #Ross Ulbricht    #Encryption    #Europe    #Fraud    #Australia  
South Korea Bitcoin Frenzy: Everyone is Rushing to Invest in Cryptocurrencies,Joseph Young,12/10/2017 8:25,40509,0,"Hundreds of thousands of South Korean investors have started to invest in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, fueling a sudden increase in demand.The exponential growth rate of the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market has reached to a point in which South Korea’s prime minister Lee Nak-yeon and deputy prime minister Kim Dong-yeon, who also operates as the minister of strategy and finance, have released public statements in regards to potential policies that will be imposed in the short-term to regulate the South Korean cryptocurrency market.In an interview with Nathaniel Poppers of the New York Times, Korbit founder and CEO Tony Lyu stated that in the South Korean finance market, if the popularity of an asset spikes and a few people are invested in it, the vast majority of the market and investors rush to invest in that particular asset, in a desperate attempt to follow the trend.Lyu stated:“Word just spreads really fast in Korea. Once people are invested, they want everyone else to join the party. There’s been this huge, almost a community movement around this.”Such mindset of the majority of investors in the South Korean finance and cryptocurrency markets have led to a surge in cryptocurrency trading activities. In August, the daily trading volume of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb surpassed that of KOSDAQ, the country’s leading stock market.Bithumb3Billion_Cointelegraph_12.9.2017South Korean deputy prime minister Kim also emphasized that investor and consumer protection will need to be implemented by the end of 2018, given that investors of all ages have started to invest in the cryptocurrency.Previously, the South Korean government and its financial regulators were hesitant toward regulating the local cryptocurrency market, because doing so would provide legitimacy to the market. However, earlier this month, the South Korean government decided to regulate the market, considering the exponential increase in the demand for the cryptocurrency market.Chosun, a South Korean mainstream media outlet, reported that South Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Ministry of Justice, Financial Services Commission, Fair Trade Commission and Financial Supervisory Commission have created a cryptocurrency task force to investigate into various aspects of the cryptocurrency market the government will be able to regulate in the short-term.One of the spokespersons of the task force told Chosun that the South Korean government intends to follow the regulatory frameworks and roadmaps integrated by leading economies and Bitcoin markets such as Japan and the US.The Spokesperson said:“The South Korean government has no other choice but to follow the regulatory frameworks and trends established by other leading governments. While there certainly exists a negative reputation attached to the cryptocurrencies, the government’s stance is to allow what has to be allowed, for the benefit of the South Korean market.”Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin. Further noted that considering the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market’s daily trading volume and size, regulatory frameworks by the South Korean government are necessary for the market and industry to grow. Glucksmann added:“Given the size of the market, there’s a greater need for them to come up with something soon.”",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #South Korea    #Investments    #Markets    #New York    #Government  
Australian Exchanges Now Required to Register with AML Regulatory Body,Joshua Althauser,12/9/2017 13:57,29923,0,"The Australian government has implemented a law mandating Bitcoin exchanges operating in the country to register with the anti-money laundering agency Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).The move is aimed at imposing restrictions on digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, due to their continuous growth and adoption in the mainstream financial sector.The bill was first filed with the Australian parliament in August 2017 with an aim to fight the threat of financial crime in the country. The country’s parliamentarians felt that there was a need to do this after the discovery that one of the major banks, Commonwealth Bank, has violated laws related to money laundering.The filing of the bill was also driven by the report of the Financial Action Task Force, which stated that the existing laws to combat money laundering have serious flaws and should be amended to eliminate loopholes.Under the new law,the AUSTRAC is empowered to monitor the activities of all virtual currency exchanges operating in Australia’s jurisdiction. The main aim of the monitoring is to ensure that financial transactions are not related to money laundering or terrorism.The law mandates that virtual currencies will receive the same treatment as physical cash in a bank with regards to money laundering and transactions suspected to be supportive of terrorism.The directive also requires businesses offering cryptocurrency exchange services to verify their customers’ identities, keep a record of transactions and report any threshold transactions or suspicious deals. A threshold transaction is the transfer of virtual currencies worth AUD10,000 or more.The new regulation also imposes both jail time and fines to any company found guilty of operating unregistered cryptocurrency exchanges. The penalty for unregistered exchanges starts with a two year jail term and/or a fine of $105,000, while violators of more serious offenses could face a fine of $2.1 mln for corporations and $420,000 for individuals.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Bitcoin Adoption    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
Crypto “Prophets” From 1997 Point to IRS Showdown: Expert Blog,Dashiell Shapiro,12/8/2017 17:40,28624,0,"Expert Blog is Cointelegraph’s new series of articles by crypto industry leaders. It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.Milton Friedman is not the only thinker who may have predicted the rise of cryptocurrencies two decades ago. In The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age, James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg wrote in 1997 about financial technology in strikingly prescient terms:“After the turn of the millennium, much of the world's commerce will migrate into the new realm of cyberspace, a region where governments will have no more dominion than they exercise over the bottom of the sea or the outer planets.”Seems about right. It’s fun to examine some of these early prophesies of cryptocurrency and how they imagine the future. And especially, to compare them to how the world actually looks today.What makes Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s book particularly interesting, though, is its economic and political predictions. They envision a world rife with offshore tax evasion and fiat currency debasement, which leads to an economic flight to “cyberspace.” Here’s how they put it:“When the state finds itself unable to meet its committed expenditure by raising tax revenues, it will resort to other, more desperate measures. Among them is printing money…. In almost every competitive area, including most of the world's multitrillion dollar investment activity, the migration of transactions into cyberspace will be driven by an almost hydraulic pressure-the impetus to avoid predatory taxation, including the tax that inflation places upon everyone who holds his wealth in a national currency.”Indeed. These points may seem obvious to many in the cryptocurrency world today, but in 1997 this was somewhat prophetical thinking.But what did Davidson and Rees-Mogg predict governments will do in response to this flight to cyberspace? They envisioned a fairly bleak future, where western governments will “turn nasty” and “seek to suppress the cybereconomy by totalitarian means.”One might argue that we’re already there. Anyone who’s been audited by the IRS for cryptocurrency transactions might surely feel that way! Or maybe this future is just around the corner.But are we really in store for a totalitarian imposition of tax on cryptocurrency transactions? Attempts to outlaw transactions in Bitcoin?We could be, but it’s also worth looking at what Davidson and Rees-Mogg got wrong. For example, they predicted that governments will find themselves virtually unable to track these cyberspace transactions, especially those that end up in offshore banks. They write:Widespread adoption of public-key/private-key encryption technologies will soon allow many economic activities to be completed anywhere you please…. Once the next logical steps have been taken, and offshore banking locations offer the services of communication in hard RSA-encrypted electronic mail using account numbers derived from public-key systems, financial transactions will be almost impossible to monitor at the bank or in communications. Even if the tax authorities were to plant a mole in the offshore bank, or burglarize the bank records, they would not be able to identify depositors.Moles in offshore banks? Burglarizing the bank records? Clearly, the authors underestimated the power of western governments.Nowadays, IRS tax collectors don’t need to burglarize any offshore bank records, because Swiss banks (and almost every other country’s banks) regularly open their books to the US and other western tax collectors.Davidson and Rees-Mogg did not foresee the United States’ offshore enforcement efforts over the past decade or Congress’s passing of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (or FATCA). How could they? It seemed impossible that the Swiss would just abandon their long-held bank secrecy tradition when the US came knocking. But never say never.So are we really due for a totalitarian tax future in cyberspace? Well, it’s probably not going to be as bleak as they imagined it. Western governments are more adept at tracking financial transactions than Davidson and Rees-Mogg envisioned, for sure.But is the cryptocurrency economy going to avoid a showdown with the IRS? Also unlikely. Due to the difficulty of tracing transactions, and the amount of tax revenue at stake, we can expect some pushback by the IRS.As a tax attorney, I’ve seen the IRS’s offshore tax enforcement efforts over the last decade, and it may offer some clues to what is coming for the cryptocurrency economy. In the early stages, we saw subpoenas to foreign banks, like UBS, for their US client’s records. This is now starting with Coinbase and other exchanges.Next came ramped up pressure on the Swiss banks to comply, including criminal prosecutions of major banks and key officers. The IRS also looked to mail carriers like Federal Express for records of mailings between Swiss banks and US persons. This might mean subpoenas to ISPs, wallet app providers, or others, for their transaction records.Finally, as the IRS lacked the resources to audit everyone with a Swiss Bank account, it instituted a disclosure program. Offshore account holders could come forward through the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (the “OVDP”), file back taxes, pay a penalty, and avoid jail time. Those who came forward earliest got a better deal. The IRS got the best deal, bringing in more than $10 bln in tax revenue.If the last decade of offshore tax enforcement efforts is any guide, a showdown between the IRS and the cryptocurrency world is probably looming. But it may be more efficient and bureaucratic and less totalitarian than Davidson and Rees-Mogg envisioned.Still, the notion that western governments will be unable to tax cryptocurrency gains is unrealistic. Taxes are one of the two guarantees in life, and it makes sense to plan for them, even with cryptocurrencies.

South Korea’s Financial Services Commission Plans To Reverse ICO Ban,Lisa Froelings,12/8/2017 12:31,30364,0,"South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is planning to introduce regulations for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, as well as to lift the blanket ban on initial coin offerings (ICO) in the country. The plans were revealed by a senior agency official on Dec. 6, 2017.In his statement at a public hearing of the National Assembly to tackle a proposed legislation for the creation of a legal framework on cryptocurrencies, FSC vice-chairman Kim Yong-beom confirmed the commission’s plan to regulate the local digital currency market in order to prevent illegal activities like money laundering and tax evasion.He also claimed that the agency is closely monitoring the developments in the virtual currency trading markets and is prepared to impose tougher measures if required.“The government doesn’t consider cryptocurrencies as money or financial products. We will regulate Bitcoins to curtail money laundering and tax dodging.”In his statement, Yong-beom claimed that the agency may also lift the complete ban on ICOs that was implemented in late September 2017. He also mentioned that they may allow only professional investors to participate in the new model of raising capital for startup companies.He said that the everyday retail investors will not be allowed to take part in ICOs for startups and companies’ financing using virtual currencies.“Bitcoin is complicated in its technology and investment method. So considering its risk and technology expertise, it is right for professional investors to do an ICO, not regular citizens who are not informed of its technology and complicity.”Meanwhile, the South Korean government is currently implementing regulations for the Bitcoin exchanges in its jurisdiction. Under the new rules, exchanges are required to comply with several consumer protection standards, as well as know-your-customer (KYC) norms in order to be allowed to operate in the country.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #ICO    #Banned Bitcoin  
South Korea Preparing Full Crypto Exchange ‘Ban’ - Local Press,William Suberg,12/8/2017 12:16,71654,0,"South Korea is reportedly “considering” a ban on cryptocurrency exchange as lawmakers criticize it as “deceptive.”As local news outlet Hankyung reports today, the government is currently looking at changes to the law which would effectively criminalize exchanges in a method similar to China.“We are actively considering ways to prohibit transactions on domestic exchanges by judging virtual currency trading as a deceptive means of defrauding people [...]  under the penal code,"" the publication quotes an official as saying.This, the official continued, requires “serious reviewing and regulation of virtual money traders.”The latest announcements capitalize on a slew of negative regulatory steps against Bitcoin from Korea in recent weeks.A full ban on ICOs kicked off a clampdown which will now also see Bitcoin futures outlawed, while cryptocurrency will be subject to income tax and income transfer tax in future, authorities have suggested.Previous information stated the government’s position on exchanges as requiring citizens on have only one account linked to their real identity.A sign of the confused approach taken to the booming cryptocurrency phenomenon, this week Korea’s Financial Services Commission also announced plans to lift the ICO ban.",26,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Banned Bitcoin    #ICO  
Global Banking Regulator Warns Of Bitcoin Bubble,Jon Buck,12/8/2017 12:09,20812,0,"Bitcoin has had a tremendous week, by any accounting, but Stefan Ingves, governor of Sweden's Riksbank and the chairman of global regulators at the Basel Committee, has warned investors that the risk may be huge. According to the regulator, investing in Bitcoin is a dangerous endeavor.The banking regulator stressed that investment in things that rise wildly is generally not a good idea, given the nature of investment generally. He said that the future of cryptocurrencies and the traditional banking world are not particularly linked, and made it clear that legacy banking was not a thing of the past. He said:""Let me also stress that sometimes there is a bit of a hype when people talk about fintech, thinking that old-fashioned banking is going to go away. But I don't think that is going to happen because regardless of the technology available, in most countries we have had banks for hundreds and hundreds of years and most likely it is going to continue that way.”Of course, many, both in and out of the crypto market, see Ingves’s comments as nearsighted and biased, given his current status as a banker. Mark Yusko, for example, recently suggested that bankers should be scared of Bitcoin and that the price had only just begun to rise.Here is what I believe. #Bitcoin entering knee of S-Curve and has LONG way to go... pic.twitter.com/nqlwis2uN0Other industry insiders concur, though also speculating that governments will continue to enforce new regulation on the cryptocurrency market. Particularly given the anonymity made possible through Bitcoin and others, it seems likely to some that governments will certainly seek greater levels of control. According to Ted O'Neill - Founder & Chairman of Narrative:“We will continue to see governments become more involved from a regulatory standpoint. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a threat to the status quo.  As crypto continues to gain traction, it will force all governments to assess the net impact. The biggest long-term threat is to the tax systems; the unparalleled control that people have with crypto makes it harder to track the transaction flow, and thus many governments will want to regulate (and control) these transactions as much as possible.""",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bubble    #Banking    #Cryptocurrencies  
Government Regulators Issue Strong Warnings On BTC Futures,Jon Buck,12/8/2017 10:54,18238,0,"Bitcoin futures are coming from a number of arenas, with recent announcements from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Tokyo Financial Exchange. However, in spite of the massive run up on Bitcoin in anticipation, US regulators are clear that they will keep very tight control over the market.According to statements from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), regulators will be paying careful attention to the Bitcoin futures markets in order to ensure that they are not manipulated. According to Andrew Busch, the CFTC’s chief market intelligence officer:""The exchanges are looking at the underlying cash contract to make sure it's not manipulated. Our role as a derivatives regulator is to make sure the futures contract it's not manipulated. We're going to do that for sure.

The CFTC has, nevertheless, approved the futures markets for both the CBOE and CME, and the Nasdaq has made suggestions that it will also begin trading in Q2 2018. The Bitcoin price has skyrocketed in recent days and remains highly volatile ahead of the massive mainstream adoption that futures represent.

"What’s the Plan, Government - Bitcoin or No Bitcoin For India?",Neer Varshney,12/7/2017 18:03,32314,0,"Are Bitcoin and trading cryptocurrencies legal in India? The government has not come up with a definite answer but with multiple contradicting statements over the years. When it comes to the regulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India, there are three most relevant authorities where the word can come from— the Government of India, the Supreme Court or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Let’s analyze, what their views have been so far, and the direction in which we are headed.Reserve Bank of India has so far come with two announcements related to the legal status of Bitcoin. The first one, issued on Dec. 24, 2013, warned people against the ‘potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.’On Feb. 1, 2017, the Reserve Bank reiterated its stance, stating that it has not given ‘any license/authorization to any entity/company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. As such, any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with Virtual Currencies will be doing so at their own risk.’On Sep. 13, 2017, Sudarshan Sen, RBI’s executive director, speaking at an official event said:""Right now, we have a group of people who are looking at fiat cryptocurrencies. Something that is an alternative to the Indian rupee, so to speak. We are looking at that closely.""  However, he further added:""As regards non-fiat cryptocurrencies, I think we are not comfortable...non-fiat cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins, for example.""On Dec. 6, 2017, RBI reiterated their warning for the third time.After a long grey period, in June 2017, it was reported that the Govt. of India is considering regulating Bitcoin and granting it a legal status, after a govt. appointed committee gave it a positive nod. However, this never materialized.An interdisciplinary committee formed in April 2017 by the Finance Minister of India, Arun Jaitley, had in its report submitted on Aug. 2nd, 2017, recommended banning all cryptocurrencies.In November 2017, the Supreme Court ordered the government to respond to a petition filed in the Supreme Court pleading to regulate the flow of Bitcoin and ensure that this virtual currency be made accountable to the exchequer.A few weeks after this judgment, on Nov. 30 2017, the finance minister of India, Arun Jaitley, speaking at an event reiterated RBI’s stance:“...As far as the Indian government’s stance is concerned, we have not given any legitimacy to cryptocurrency. Yes, we have received the report, and it is under examination.”Some of India’s largest banks, including ICICI, SBI, and Kotak Mahindra, have been utilizing Blockchain technology. RBI’s executive director had hinted that RBI is looking into creating its own cryptocurrency like the central banks of England or China. Soon after this, news broke out that the Govt. of India has plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency named ‘Lakshmi’ (named after the Hindu goddess of wealth).Currently Bitcoin faces multiple challenges from existing laws in India, mainly from the RBI Act of 1934, the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999, and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002. Any legalization of Bitcoin or introduction of a new cryptocurrency, even if RBI controlled, will need an amendment in the RBI Act of 1934 and FEMA, at least.The government has been taking a ‘wait and watch’ policy when it comes to cryptocurrencies— but it will prove to be disastrous, since, as we speak, more and more Users are trading cryptocurrencies in India. As per the President of Blockchain.com, Nicolas Cary, over 2,500 Indian Users trade cryptocurrencies every day.The overall legal development in relation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in India, however, is taking a perceivable direction: ditch Bitcoin and adopt the technology behind it.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #India    #Reserve Bank of India  
"Bitcoin Will Be Legal In Russia, Mining to Be Regulated",Gareth Jenkinson,12/7/2017 16:53,44763,0,"As Russian works on legislation on the trade of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there’s a possibility that mining could be criminalized.Not in the straightforward sense, according to deputy finance minister Aleksey Moiseev as quoted by RT:""The penalties will be different, mostly administrative, but if someone created the cryptocurrency for the purpose of settlements, then there will be a criminal punishment.”Moiseev confirmed that there would be criminal penalties for people who create pyramid schemes or cryptocurrencies in order to avoid paying tax.The ministry had hinted that miners would need to register with a central authority - allowing both companies and entrepreneurs to set up operations.As the state works on legislation, Moiseev stressed that buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would be legalized. Just how long it will take for this new legislation to take effect is a matter of time, but it could be a few months at the least.This is quite an about turn for the country, as president Vladimir Putin had all but condemned Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in October.The Russian president has ordered the government to set up regulations for the trade of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ICOs and mining by July 2018.The country is also developing its very own cryptocurrency, the CryptoRuble, which ironically cannot be mined. CryptoRuble will reportedly be controlled by the state and can be exchanged for regular Rubles.There are also plans afoot to test the possibility of Blockchain technology being used for voting systems in the country.",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Bitcoin Mining  
NY regulator may break down on Bitcoin,Cecilia Grigolia,8/12/2013 13:05,106,0,"New York financial regulators are concerned about virtual currency influence in “Wild West”, investigating such virtual currencies as one of the most popular- Bitcoin. Superintendent of the state’s Department of Financial Services, Benjamin Lawsky, stated that they are contemplating new regulations for virtual currencies.Virtual currency is known for being an unregulated currency and Bitcoin was stated to be regulation- free in 2009. Virtual currency is base on mathematical schemes which fights against tampering and maintains its authentication.Just like money, virtual currency can be used for any purpose, both legal and illegal causes. Benjamin Lawsky expresses his opposition about unregulated digital currency and states that virtual currency has been used for narcotics purchase, guns and child pornography.""If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country's national security, but also the very existence of the virtual currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise. Indeed, it is in the common interest of both the public and the virtual currency industry to bring virtual currencies out of the darkness and into the light of day through enhanced transparency. It is vital to put in place appropriate safeguards for consumers and law-abiding citizens.""22 subpoenas were produced last week, regarding the information about anti- money laundering measures, investment materials and consumer protections. The investigation of the issues is at its very beginning, but the Department of Financial Services is very concerned about money transmission, which is under agency regulations. Lawsky expounds that putting safeguard regulations on virtual currency is going to play a positive role and be beneficial to the long- term strength of the virtual currency itself.Bitcoin has been slowly increasing in its value over recent years. For example, this spring the price shot up from 40 U.S. dollar to 266$. However, right after that the price slumped back to 40$. The reason for that was said to be the limitation on capital leaving Cyprus after clasping down on banks and confiscating deposits.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #New York    #USA    #Benjamin Lawsky  
'Bitcoin is a currency': Federal judge says virtual money is a real currency,Cecilia Grigolia,8/8/2013 17:15,94,0,"As it is known, Bitcoin is a digital currency, which works through online transfers. However, physical Bitcoins were created by a bitcoin enthusiast, Casascius. Each physical bitcoin has its personal code in order to detect a number of bitcoins online. Can bitcoins be considered as real money and be regulated by authorities, like usual dollar currency or is it still virtual online money? Federal judge states it is real money.Texan Trendor Shavers was accused of fraudulent Ponzi scheme, which makes millions of dollars in Bitcoin market. Ponzi scheme is a swindling investment operation, which pays returns from investor’s money, instead of from profit earned by organisation. Anyways, at the U.S. District Court, Shavers challenged authority by stating that Bitcoins are not considered as real money, therefore it cannot be examined as a fraud.Magistrate Judge Amos Maazant of the Eastern District of Texas federal court argued the evidence in a memorandum summarising Shavers argues, where he states that Bitcoin is not real money and therefore the BTCST investments are not securities. He also underlines the fact that Shavers affirms that no money has ever exchanged hands and all the transactions were made through Bitcoin. However, judge Maazant argues Shavers statements in a memorandum, explaining that BTCST investments are actually securities, since they are both investment contracts and notes. He also insists that Bitcoin is real money or a form of money, which you can purchase goods and services with. He also claims that bitcoins can be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore investors in BTCST are investing real money.It seems judge Maazant talks about Bitcoin, as if it was more like a metal or some other valuable resource. The executive director of Bitcoin Foundation agrees with Judge Maazant and explains that Bitcoin is now getting recognised more as commodity money, the way silver and gold are recognised as money.Therefore, this kind of recognition may lead to International Standards Organisation to approve Bitcoin and classify it as a “non- national” commodity, which does not need to be issued and regulated by authorities.As discussed in our previous articles, Bitcoin is rapidly spreading across the world, although it has both advantages and disadvantages. Bitcoin seems to be on its way to obtain its legitimacy, though that might bring up those disadvantages and problems, which businesses are already facing.Shavers’ hearing is not over yet and judge Maazants’ opinion might be overturned in an appeal or new case about this issue. Although, if Bitcoin is going to be viewed as a real currency, Shavers’ investment operation will be considered as fraudulence.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA  
On Eve of Success? How Accepted Are Cryptocurrencies Today,Julia Daimio,8/8/2016 19:35,992,1100,"Six years ago, a cryptocurrency was used as a medium of exchange for the first time - that precedent was later called the most expensive pizza delivery ever.Many things have changed since back then, but Bitcoin - not to mention more than 700 altcoins - still only seeks to be considered an adequate alternative to fiat money.Cointelegraph spoke to Mihir Magudia, ?ommunications Director at LEOcoin Foundation, about the potential of digital currencies and the main reasons for the arrest of their development as a method of payment.Magudia believes that it’s important to help people understand the power and potential of digital currencies, and to show them how they can benefit most from it. This can change the way that business is done.LEOcoin is a pseudonymous digital currency, which is working within a decentralized peer-to-peer network, entirely on a PoS validation algorithm, and was made specifically for small business owners. The currency was created in 2014 by Learning Enterprises Organization (LEO) - a company specializing in eLearning, eTutoring and skills development for entrepreneurs. Such a background let LEOcoin find 200,000 advocates, young entrepreneurs nurtured on LEO educational programmes, at once.Magudia explains:“LEOcoin is designed to be easy to use and participate in. Entrepreneurs and businesses need a coin to be stable and they need it to be mass market, that is what we are working on.”Creating a large and loyal community is not a decisive advantage, albeit an important one. When moving further, every cryptocurrency takes its own path.One of the most popular and straightforward ways of “socializing” a cryptocurrency is to introduce it as a method of payment on all kinds of online shops and trading platforms. Quite predictably, Bitcoin is the absolute leader in this field. The coin is seemingly supported by everyone - from international tech and IT giants to small local companies across Europe.All in all, there are quite a few places where a consumer can purchase a desired commodity or receive a service in exchange for Bitcoins - the numbers are, at least, enough for niche media to publish user guides, and a dedicated stores map to be filled with marks. The situation is more complicated for altcoins, but there is hope - a lot of cryptocurrencies - the most popular ones definitely being on the list, are supported by the CoinPayments platform.Additionally, more platforms are gradually appearing, which make it their principle of operation to  support new digital currencies (such as Ethereum, Steem, Dash, and others) alongside Bitcoin; one such platform is BlockPay, for example.LeoCoin, in turn, is supported by such projects as My LEO Travel and LEOcoin Merchants.My LEO Travel is an online hotel booking platform, which was launched a couple of weeks ago. The range of the service’s features is yet to be expanded: soon the users will also be able to book cars and air tickets.The second project, LEOcoin Merchants, is a trading platform which can be used by suppliers of goods and services from all over the world. Potential consumers and businesses looking for clients can easily meet each other on this platform. Probably the only condition to use this service is that both sides have to accept and use LEOcoin as a payment method.Today, Bitcoin has managed to win such trust and love of the community that all kinds of organizations and businesses are growing around it on their own; it’s impossible not to mention the Bitcoin Foundation, which is a precedent of sorts.On the other hand, there are large commercial entities, which attract impressive amounts of capital, with the exclusive goal of financing promising startups and developments on the Bitcoin market.It’s somewhat different in the industry of altcoins. Of course, one can mention such projects as The Rudimental; it was also founded by people from the “outside”, who just believed in the technology. But more often than not, if a ‘young’ digital currency, which isn’t wildly popular at the moment, has some sort of closely associated project or organization, the coin’s creators are most likely behind that.LEOcoin Foundation is placed somewhere between the aforementioned options. It is an international non-profit organization, which is engaged in the development of both LEOcoin itself, and its infrastructure. The organization’s activities are spread in several directions. Firstly, it’s a sort of a driving engine and a guide for everything regarding LEOcoin: it conducts research, educates, engages and integrates.The Foundation facilitates efficient interaction between private and corporate entities, government and non-government, commercial and non-profit organizations. Additionally, LEOcoin Foundation is always prepared to financially support all worthy contributors, irrespective of currency affiliation.All activities are subject to one main goal - make LEOcoin not just an element of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem, but also a mass market coin.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #LEOcoin  
Bitcoin Will Not Be Widespread Due to Regulatory Uncertainty,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,8/8/2016 18:55,609,232,"It seems that regulating Bitcoin has become an ‘arduous’ task, that is true at least according to a report published by the private intelligence company Stratfor. Stratfor is a company who provide geopolitical intelligence to individuals as well as organisations across the world.Stratfor’s publication is called ‘The Arduous Task of Regulating Bitcoin’ and is available for download here. They forecast that the regulatory uncertainty will continue to act as a deterrent in the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.  In its analysis of the present situation, Stratfor thinks that while the technology behind cryptocurrencies will have a ‘greater’ impact, cryptocurrencies themselves will face some issues in being widely adopted.Stratfor forecasts:“Regulatory uncertainty will continue to inhibit the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.Though the U.S. federal government has made progress in regulating cryptocurrencies, uncertainty and ambiguity at the state level will be more difficult to overcome. Blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies, will have a greater impact than the cryptocurrencies derived from it.”What exactly cryptocurrencies are seems to be the biggest issue when it comes to the future of Bitcoin and other forms of digital money out there. This is a question we have addressed in a recent article in Cointelegraph as well.Stratfor has taken a similar line of thinking and says in the report:“Individuals and businesses must inevitably wait for laws to be figured out and enacted before new technologies can be fully utilized. This has been particularly true of cryptocurrencies — most notably Bitcoin and financial technologies — which have been hindered by a lack of regulation and an abundance of confusion.”Stratfor says in the report that the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued guidelines under which administrators and exchangers  (not individuals) are to be considered as ‘money transmitters’. In the United States at least this means that transmitters are responsible for KYC and AML regulations and their  adherence. They also have to register with FinCEN. Stratfor thinks this is an onerous burden on smaller companies as well as startups, and some benefits that are traditionally attributed to cryptocurrencies such as anonymity are essentially tossed out of the window.Anyone who follows the news may have noticed in the past years how marriage equality in the United States moved from state to state until finally the Supreme Court ushered it in countrywide. Cryptocurrencies are currently on a similar curve. Only a few states according to Stratfor have issued any guidance on cryptocurrencies.Stratfor says:“Registering as a money transmitter is relatively simple at the federal level, but receiving a state license in one of the 48 states which requires one is much more difficult and time consuming. New York has made the most progress toward regulating Bitcoin, which is unsurprising considering its place at the center of the U.S. financial system. In June 2015, New York finalized BitLicense, which will likely become a model for other states to emulate.”Until the time the United States receives a nationwide definition of what cryptocurrencies are, we may keep seeing a lot of conflicting laws and regulations and more confusion.The fluid situation in Bitcoin regulations leads to some issues but there are many who think that more regulations could mean the end of ‘freedom’ and defeat the very purpose for which Bitcoin was developed.We talked with Dmitry Lazarichev, Co-founder of Wirex Limited about  the current state of regulations regarding Bitcoin.He says:“Obviously we can’t avoid a regulatory framework if we are aiming to reach further Bitcoin adoption, which is supposed to be beneficial for everyone. On the other hand, without standards and rules there are still might be options of how to avoid regulatory requirements. Thus, the Bitcoin community should be embracing the regulation in the first place. The regulators can apply existing AML and KYC rules and monitor legal entities such as exchanges dealing with fiat. However, there are no solid concepts yet in how to regulate pure crypto-to-crypto services and platforms.”On the other hand there is also merit in the point that Bitcoin may be a new asset class in itself and it may prove very difficult to regulate it with the set of ‘usual’ approaches that the authorities are taking.Simon Dixon, CEO BnkToTheFuture.com says:“No two countries take the same approach and regulators all around the world are uncertain about how to tackle Bitcoin financial institutions. The first hurdle is defining it as an asset class. If they do this they may fit it into their traditional regulations, but this is very dangerous as Bitcoin is a new asset class. Bitcoin has properties of a currency as it has a global payment system attached to it, a commodity as it can be used as a store of value, a stock as its value is tracked by the utility and progress of Bitcoin and it’s also a protocol/ technology that allows companies to build financial products on top of it.”Regulation needs to keep up with new technological approaches instead of trying to classify the unknown with known labels. This is a problem that we are currently facing when it comes to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When the regulators finally do catch up, things might start looking up for cryptocurrencies, no matter what Stratfor thinks.As Dmitry Lazarichev says:“Perhaps this standard regulation should be adjustable adapting new technological breakthroughs and learning from the past cases. If the entire community can take part in formulating such standards, it would be ideal.”",4,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA    #Dmitry Lazarichev    #Simon Dixon  
Why Banks Will Fail to Apply Blockchain Technology,Joseph Young,8/6/2016 10:00,376,1153,"Despite years of development, the finance industry has failed to showcase a working application of the blockchain technology. Experts believe that banks may have overlooked the most important concept of the technology: decentralization.The formation of the R3 consortium and the increasing interests from major multi-billion dollar banks have led blockchain to become an international phenomenon.Large financial institutions and government agencies rushed to implement the technology in various areas of their operations, specifically to optimize the settlement of financial transactions.Banks for instance, have focused on applying the technology on their existing IT infrastructure and financial systems to process cross-border payments, settlement and clearance of assets to reduce cost and time dealt by both the bank and the customers.Venture capital firms naturally followed the shift in trend, moving from traditional fintech to blockchain startups, with support from banks and government-backed organizations.However, with hundreds of millions of dollars spent on the development of blockchain-based financial systems, the finance industry is yet to provide a working demonstration of the product.The major reason behind the banks’ failure to deal with the blockchain technology is their ambition to create private blockchain networks that could run parallel to their existing applications. Which means, rather than utilizing the open and distributed network the blockchain technology can provide, the banks attempted to reinvent the technology for their own benefits.Decentralization, the concept which the banks failed to address, is the backbone of the blockchain technology and is the element that makes a blockchain network valuable and robust.To date, the only really successful example of the blockchain technology has been Bitcoin, because of the Bitcoin network’s decentralized and transparent nature.The problem with the banks’ approach fundamentally is associated with the financial regulations and compliance they’re required to deal with.Since banks are demanded by local and global authorities to follow strict Know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, they must operate a private blockchain network to provide personal and private data of their customers to the law enforcement.Thus, unless the banks can give up on the idea of developing private blockchain networks and applying that to their existing systems, the finance industry will struggle to see a working implementation of the technology.This inability of the banks have also led to a significant change in the trend of the blockchain technology in the market, with startups migrating from financial applications of the blockchain to data-driven platforms.Such platforms have proved their efficiency in the insurance, real estate, and trade finance industries, with Europe’s top blockchain startups showcasing various functional products that are applicable to many industries.    ",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Decentralization  
"Bitcoin Slump Factors: EU Regulation, Halving, ETC, Scaling Issue",Olusegun Ogundeji,8/3/2016 11:16,147,155,"Aside the Bitfinex hack which is explicable, every time there is a drop in the price of Bitcoin - as we have seen in recent days - several unfounded factors tend to crop up to provide plausible cause.This article was written to look at issues that affect Bitcoin price and yet defy a collective reasoning of consensus among many users. A case in focus is between Friday July 29 and August 1 when the price dipped by more than $50 from $655 to $603.What was responsible for that?There is a view that the current price is a reflection of the proposed regulation being considered for introduction by the EU. The idea is to collect, process and record personal data, and sometimes to share such data of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies users with relevant authorities. Anonymity has really worked for Bitcoin providing necessary freedom for users. This view supports the fact that the fear of the regulation being passed had a grip on the market.One issue raised is the closed door meeting between Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin Core developers. Though its summary has not been released, there are suggestions that the Bitcoin Core did not uphold its alleged agreement with Chinese miners on scaling which resulted in a loss in confidence.According to Coin Dance Bitcoin Community Opinion Poll Summary, more than 82% of respondents to the question ‘Do you think the Bitcoin network should hard fork to increase the block size limit?’ say ‘yes’ while over 17% say ‘no’. While this poll could not be verifiably considered to be an accurate representation of the community, the wide margin could hint at a growing disparity.It may be surprising that the dip has been linked to the reality of the halving effect now setting in. There is a view that Bitcoin mining has become less profitable for small operations, especially since the halving on July 9, hence its effect is being felt now.Another says the price of Bitcoin went up because of the halvening hype and it’s just readjusting to what should be its normal state. It is also said that since Bitcoin did not shoot to the moon as expected after the halving, but moved up a bit based on speculation, the readjustment in the price created some panic.There are insinuations that people are using their BTC to buy ETC which is the most attractive digital currency currently in terms of 24-hour trading volume. Some think the shift to the newly-split, especially for its price rise around the days under review, is not just a coincidence.Still in the market force context, there is another view that there is no right answer to the cause of the dip because no one has it. A better explanation is that it is a breakout from a long range of tightening in which the market chose to go down - at least - for now.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #Ethereum classic    #EU    #Bitcoin Halving  
Zimbabwe Central Bank Warns Bitcoin Use; No Regulations Yet,Joseph Young,7/30/2016 14:12,431,271,"At the annual Digital Payments Conference held at the Meikles Hotel Zimbabwe on July 28, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) warned the country’s citizens against the various risks involved in using Bitcoin.The central bank’s Senior Executive of the National Payment Systems department Josephat Mutepfa, told the event’s audience—which primarily consisted of financial startups, experts, and entrepreneurs—that despite the popularity of Bitcoin, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe discourages the use of Bitcoin. This is due to the lack of regulatory frameworks for exchanges and startups providing digital currency related financial services.While economic benefits of using digital currencies such as Bitcoin are evident to the central bank, the organization believes that any type of unregulated alternatives must be approached with caution, even if it provides the unbanked an opportunity to regain financial control.Mutepfa specifically identified some Bitcoin startups including Bitmari, a company which enables Zimbabweans to send money across other countries in Africa, at substantially lower costs by using Bitcoin.The concern of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is justifiable, mainly because the government lacks the necessary information to fully understand and regulate digital currencies like Bitcoin.According to various statistics however, the rapid growth of the Bitcoin industry and market in countries like Zimbabwe seems inevitable. A recent study released by the multi-billion dollar auditing company KPMG demonstrates an unprecedented level of development in the mobile payment space in Sub-Saharan Africa.Since 2014, nearly 95% of Zimbabweans have used mobile money to pay utility bills and the mobile money account penetration rate in 2014 was estimated at 25%, which was higher than the bank account penetration rate in the country.This major shift in trend from banking services to mobile payments demonstrates the financial issues that the majority of the Zimbabwean population struggle to deal with when using banking products and services.To obtain a bank account, an individual must provide a list of documents and evidence of a stable fixed income, which many people in Zimbabwe fail to offer. Thus, bank services are limited to a closed group of members in the society. When this financial isolation occurs, naturally, Zimbabweans search for alternatives and one of the most easily obtainable and accessible financial payment method is Bitcoin.The central bank’s discouragement of the use of Bitcoin due to the lack of regulatory frameworks for digital currencies can be observed as the government’s ignorance towards the unbanked population.",6,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Zimbabwe    #Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  
National Cryptoequity - Pleasant Opposite of National Debt?,Joël Valenzuela,7/29/2016 12:00,203,166,"The modern government-run financial system employs a staggering amount of national debt. The United States’s national debt is fast approaching $18 trillion, with no sign of stopping. This debt, while incurred by the government, ends up being the responsibility of the public to pay it off, or else risk collective financial suicide.However, instead of shouldering this massive burden and having economic progress crushed under its weight, there exists a way to use cryptocurrency to achieve the opposite effect for people: give them equity.Establishing by dictat a common, controlled currency for a nation has the effect of economically isolating that area from the rest of the world. By placing restrictions around the medium of exchange in an arbitrary geographic area, businesses with parties outside of that area is made much more difficult.Cross-border transactions require at a minimum that a currency exchange has to take place, which may be subjected to capital controls, money laundering laws, etc.Navigating the banking systems, legal restrictions, exchange rates and so on can make doing business internationally much more difficult than with cryptocurrency, where any transaction to anywhere in the world is the same as any other.A feature of central banking for government (a curse for the people) is the ability to inflate currency to pay off debts. Citizens holding the currency are forced to watch it devalued, as their life savings are diminished with each new unit printed.While in countries without strict capital controls it is possible to invest in other currencies or stockpile commodities such as gold, legal tender laws still apply. Therefore, a certain portion of finances must remain liquid in the country’s devaluing currency in order to cover day-to-day expenses, disproportionately affecting the nation’s poor.With high inflation, the rich see losses on whatever small portion of their wealth is forced to remain liquid, while their investments in commodities or offshore accounts remain unaffected.The government profits from the printing of money, as it amounts to value out of nothing for them while they drain value from everyone holding that currency. The poor and the middle class, finally, are affected the worst, since a significant portion of their earnings must remain liquid to cover expenses. For the poorest living close to margins, any change in value of the currency can be devastating.Fiat currencies, backed by no commodity and able to be inflated at will, have no intrinsic value. The value they do maintain is based on confidence in the government, its management of the economy, and the strength of that economy. In the event of economic catastrophe, including government mismanagement or default, the currency’s value will plummet.When a government accrues debt, it becomes the “national debt,” or the responsibility of the people. This in turn puts an economic gun to the head of every single citizen. No matter how little the people consented to whatever massive debt was run up by their government, they are forced to pay it off whatever it takes, or else risk losing the value of their life savings overnight. By holding the people hostage with the national debt, they can ensure that no one will simply refuse to pay taxes. This extortion scheme is airtight as long as there is no other option for money.Enter cryptocurrency to save the day, rescuing the people from the dark, oppressive dungeon of a government’s control over money. To begin with, no cryptocurrency worth its salt can be inflated on a whim, robbing its users of the value of their hard work. The price must be dictated by the laws of supply and demand, and a well-managed currency with a robust user base will see its value react accordingly.Even if a cryptocurrency is mismanaged and does its users wrong, they are always free to move on (sometimes instantly, in the case of using a Coinomi wallet and converting to another currency with its integrated ShapeShift functionality), providing a considerable economic incentive not to bungle the currency.Finally, using a pseudonymous or anonymous currency means reporting transactions to whatever authorities is a voluntary choice, freeing up commerce that is either illegal, restricted, highly taxed, or otherwise inconvenienced to be able to operate at peak efficiency.Traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do empower the common man and provide a way out of financial slavery, but their positive effects are more limited to certain groups of people.A currency that is mostly (or entirely) brought into existence by miners running a complex algorithm centralizes its benefits around the technological class, making them the gatekeepers of the new financial system.As the old system slowly sinks to oblivion, the everyman will be stuck scrambling for entry into the new one as cryptocurrency prices rise to meet the growing demand. This is still far more equitable than the government system, and it allows the savvy to buy into the future at any time, but there might be an even better way.The distribution of currency via “airdrop” method imparts an additional benefit beyond that of providing a tool for people to use. By primarily disseminating the currency directly to the public, rather than through crowdsales or mining, value is shared with an entire population rather than a select few.Even without an airdrop, a digital currency crafted with the branding, infrastructure, and development team goals geared towards getting the maximum amount of cryptocurrency in daily use by as many people as possible in a highly localized area will have the effect of benefiting an entire nation more than those select few.By giving a newly-minted cryptocurrency to those in a certain area with their interest and branding involved, they are able to build equity in themselves and the strength of their own economy.Whereas a centrally-banked fiat currency drains collective wealth from people even in good times, a national cryptocurrency allows the benefits of their economic well-being to remain and multiply. In short, national cryptoequity is the pleasant opposite of national debt.The old paradigm for money was to force people to use a currency, then gradually steal all its value through inflation. The new paradigm is to create a voluntary cryptocurrency, and reward early adopters and infrastructural developers, with the rest of the general public able to catch on whenever they hear about it.Could the future paradigm be to bequeath digital money to as many people as possible, allowing the masses to grow rich as the currency is developed and gains value?",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Inflation    #National Debt

A “financial transaction” is a “transaction… involving one or more monetary instruments, which in any way or degree affects commerce…” If the statute is read to mean that in the transaction, the Defendant must be the party who uses the monetary instruments then the money laundering statute would not apply in this case, because Bitcoins, as previously discussed, are not monetary instruments. [emphasis added]”Pooler’s ruling, in addition to establishing Bitcoin’s legal status, also facilitated Bitcoin sellers from being targeted for legal repercussions for the potentially illegal actions of their customers.“Detective Arias did represent to the defendant, in so many words, that he was planning to trade what he was buying from the Defendant (Bitcoin) for stolen credit card numbers. The statute requires that the officer as buyer that what was in this case, legally purchased Bitcoin is being used to conduct or facilitate illegal activity; it does not require any affirmative acknowledgement or action from the seller.The statute does go on to require that the Defendant charged under this statute undertake the transaction with the intent to promote the carrying on of illegal activity...”While exchanges that must adhere to AML/KYC regulations still watch where their customers spend Bitcoin, the average Bitcoiner at a meetup can buy and sell with very few restrictions in most cases, no matter the customer’s intentions.As with the internet’s advent, the rise of cryptocurrency has led to delays from world governments in classifying and regulating Bitcoin, and as a result, Bitcoin is largely legal and unregulated around the world.Most countries with a legal definition for cryptocurrency consider it a currency, while others, like the United States, classify it as a commodity.Currently in Germany, Bitcoin is not considered as currency and as such is not taxed, leading payroll service Pey to offer a tax-free Bitcoin bonus.Meanwhile in the United States, estate taxes can result in government claiming the majority of your estate after death, while holding Bitcoin can help avoid this.Finally, cryptocurrency has the ability to claim ever-increasing demand for tax havens, and may even end traditional forms of taxation entirely.",2,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Miami    #AML    #Money Laundering  
PSD2: German Regulator and Banks Are Not Happy With Each Other,Alicia Naumoff,7/22/2016 15:15,203,263,"The upcoming introduction of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is expected to transform the European payment industry. It has already created a turbulence, because the effects for all industry players are somewhat controversial.PSD2 is designed to improve consumer protection and competition, and drive innovation. The legislation is aimed at offering a wider scope to cover new payment services and features, and mandates banks to open their infrastructures, provide customer account access to third-party payment providers, transparency of payment charges and strong customer authentication for all electronic transactions.A misunderstanding occurred between German regulator Bundeskartellamt (The Federal Cartel Office, state national competition regulator) and country’s banking industry.German banks were indicated to violate German and European competition law by placing restrictions on non-bank payment services.The Bundeskartellamt stated that country’s banks are enforcing ‘special condition for online banking’ meaning that customers cannot use their personal security credentials in non-bank payment systems. This measure was found to be significantly hindering the use of non-bank online payment systems which are often lower-priced.The banks argued that their rules were introduced to secure their customers’ online payments, and that it is by no means an attempt to put up barriers for competing payment services.It might seem as a fair argument, as consumers are providing their banking security credentials to initiate payments, and banks here are only trying to protect their customers against fraudsters.We all know that it doesn't take much to steal private information through phishing sites.The authority, however, has dismissed this statement saying that these rules cannot be considered as a necessary part of a consistent security concept of the banks and they impede non-bank competitors.Despite years of negotiations the PSD2 legislation still appears rather confusing and the January 2018 deadline for its implementation is stifling market progress. Market participants cannot plan innovative products and services, and take on concrete steps to establish partnerships, because they are uncertain of what is going to be allowed and on what conditions.Banks are only starting to understand the potential benefits of the implemented directive deciding on what approach to follow. Some are ready to embrace this opportunity for collaboration and innovation by willingly opening up their infrastructure, while others take on self-defense tactics.It is often argued that there's no commercial incentives for banks around PSD2. In addition to making huge investments to open up their systems, banks will have to make a large amount of operational changes around pricing transparency, authentication and liability. While being forced to rebuild their systems, they would not be able to make investments to boost innovation.Sad news - they wouldn't even be able to recoup the costs, as PSD2 prohibits banks from charging third parties for access granted to them. So, third parties will be enjoying all the benefits at no costs. There's a possibility that these costs might be eventually passed to consumers.Regulators inspired by sound clauses of PSD2 is taking steps towards moving to a more open and accessible payments landscape.However, the initiatives might result in exactly the opposite - creating a fragmented and complicated industry. Implementing a regulatory and legislative change can be a challenging process, but it tends to be easier the sooner participants engage to this process. While the framework offered by PSD2 still appears to be benign, banks and authorities have to take the chance to influence the way ahead.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #PSD2    #Germany    #Banks    #EU    #Law  
Could Hillary Clinton as President Give a Boost to Blockchain Tech?,Jacob J,7/11/2016 9:30,439,89,"Hillary Clinton has announced her policy goals for technology and innovation. Her goals include positioning American innovators as world leaders in technological revolutions, including public service blockchain applications. Could Hillary as president give a boost to blockchain technology?The Tech agenda announced by Hillary Clinton plans to use technology and innovation to boost the American economy and create good-paying jobs. Her plans include increasing spending commitments in computer science education, delivering high-speed broadband to all Americans, establishing rules to support innovation, and improving government efficiency by using new technology.As Bitcoin and blockchain applications move to the mainstream, regulations have been framed by different agencies to govern them. Regulation can play a big role in the development of a new technology.Bitlicense, a license for virtual currency activities in New York, has proved a dampener for the Bitcoin community. Only 2 licenses have been issued (Circle and Ripple) so far in almost a year since it was announced. With the high cost involved in obtaining a Bitlicense, many startups have decide to relocate from New York to friendlier places.On the other hand, Bitstamp was granted a payment institution license by Luxembourg, allowing it to operate across Europe as a licensed bitcoin exchange. This reassured investors about the processes & policies in place at Bitstamp and will make it easier for the company to get funding from a wide range of investors.Blockchain continues to find applications in multiple industries, and not just by the corporate world. Sweden could become the first country to have its land registry on a blockchain, according to the Swedish Land Registry. The immutable nature of the blockchain has natural advantages in the storage of any official record, be it birth certificates, residency certificates or land records.

Brexit Just in Time! EU Cracks Down on Anonymous Bitcoin Trades,Joël Valenzuela,7/6/2016 15:20,436,46,"The European Union is set to crack down on anonymous Bitcoin trades. In a press release issued this week, the European Commission announced a move to strengthen transparency rules in order to better combat terrorism, terror financing, and money laundering.According to the statement, this includes “ending anonymity” for virtual currency exchanges:“Tackling terrorist financing risks linked to virtual currencies: to prevent misuse of virtual currencies for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, the Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. These entities will have to apply customer due diligence controls when exchanging virtual for real currencies, ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges.”According to Robert Genito, whose private peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange Wall of Coins operates in several European countries, this move is not a productive use of European resources.Genito says:“The EU putting energy into preventing Bitcoin would be a pretty foolish move. I'm sure they have bigger problems to address.”The new regulations would not likely affect normal business transactions, but would instead bring exchanges that trade cryptocurrency with fiat under increasing surveillance and regulation, disallowing them from protecting their customers’ identity.Fran Strajnar, Founder & CEO of Bravenewcoin, sees a possibility for some exchanges to be affected. However he sees a bright side of businesses affected by new regulations giving way to new, more resilient permutations.He says:""The newly adopted EU rules suggest to treat virtual currency exchanges operators (specifically exchanges and wallet type services offering a Fiat to Digital Currency exchange, not Digital to Digital exchange) the same way conventional money services are treated under established counter-terrorism, AML & KYC guidelines. It is unclear if operators like LocalBitcoins will be effected but it is likely the case. The result if LocalBitcoins are affected will be similar to when Napster was shut down - a Decentralized version will quickly emerge which cannot be taken down. I would hope regulators accommodate for innovative services like LocalBitcoins so we don't kill innovation for the illusion of security""These new regulations would only affect European Union member states. Thankfully for the future of the British cryptocurrency economy, the UK voted to leave the EU last month. This triggered a spike in the price of Bitcoin, and has led to speculation of a possible EU disintegration.With Bitcoin joining gold as a good hedge investment in uncertain times, the future looks bright for cryptocurrency.",2,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Brexit    #EU    #Anonymity  
Uber Switches to Bitcoin in Argentina After Govt Blocks Uber Credit Cards,Joël Valenzuela,7/6/2016 11:40,1479,1831,"The Argentinian government blocked credit card companies from dealing with Uber, causing the ridesharing company’s national branch to use Bitcoin instead.The city of Buenos Aires issued orders both to the national communications agency (ENACOM) and credit card companies to block the Uber app and deny the company use of credit card service. This prompted Uber to partner with Swiss Bitcoin company Xapo to enable payments through Bitcoin debit cards.The ride-sharing company has faced harsh resistance in Argentina, particularly in Buenos Aires. Taxi unions sued the city and Uber, resulting in a judge issuing an injunction to stop ride-sharing services in the city. Later, both a prosecutor and a judge ordered ENACOM to block the Uber app within the city limits. Finally, both the consumer protection agency of Buenos Aires and a judge ordered credit card companies to cease doing business with Uber.As a response to this perceived threat to the taxi industry, the transportation agency of Buenos Aires has announced development of a taxi app. This app, dubbed BA Taxi, is expected to help provide a government-sanctioned answer to the convenience of Uber’s app.By and large, Uber’s customers are adapting well to using Bitcoin through Xapo’s debit card, for which Uber gave a $30 discount. Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, President of Bitcoin Latam and CEO of RSK Labs, sees Uber’s typical customer as being willing to embrace new technology.“In general Uber users are highly knowledgeable about technology and more prone to Bitcoin understanding and usage, fears about Bitcoin usually come from more illiterate users.”According to Franco Amati, co-organizer of the Latin American Bitcoin Conference (laBITconf), most users have flocked to Bitcoin rather than lose Uber.“Nobody is deleting Uber app because of this, on the contrary, I have friends that requested Bitcoin debit cards to use Uber. Most of them from SatoshiTango, since there they have an option for a virtual debit card, so they do not even need to wait for a physical card to be delivered. But others from Xapo too as card issuer.”Amati also notes that Uber’s difficulties from authorities were what prompted this sudden explosion of interest in Bitcoin.“Also, have in mind that Uber was not accepting these cards a month ago. They added them because in Argentina all local cards are blocked by the government from using Uber (even when these cards are used outside of Argentina).”Latin America has seen its Bitcoin scene grow amid economic hardships. Puerto Rico recently defaulted on its debt, leaving creditors without $800 million in payment. Meanwhile, the central bank of Mexico raised interest rates to counter a devalued peso.Zaldivar is optimistic about Bitcoin’s future in Latin America as the cryptocurrency becomes an increasingly attractive option compared with government money.“Confidence in Bitcoin is growing steadily in Latam as the years go by and the technology proves to be resilient while the currency proves to be a safe haven compared to the highly inflationary national currencies.”",1,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Argentina    #Uber    #Latin America    #Franco Amati  
Moscow Joins Race to Wreck London As Global Fintech Capital,Alicia Naumoff,7/2/2016 16:40,371,126,"Putin’s business ombudsman says Russia must become the world’s blockchain leader, as he’s certain the country has the necessary resources.There are currently around 500 000 of Blockchain users in Russia, and the number is growing. Following the UK’s decision to leave the EU the race is now on to replace London as the global fintech capital, and Moscow may join the race.The  Party of Growth led by Boris Titov has developed a program which will be presented in the parliament elections this September. Researching and testing Blockchain applications are one of the main priorities for the development of information and financial technology in the country, and are thought to be able to help Russia depart from their dependency on oil and gas.Titov says:“It is of no less significance than the creation of the Internet. If today we attract all the main technologies and investors in the sphere of the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, having all the resources, both geographic and human, we would advance to take our place among the leading countries of the world , not only in this sphere, but in general.”The econmy’s main focus should swing towards development of the ‘economy of the future,’ which includes information and digital technologies, advanced engineering services, genetics and biotechnologies. The party stands for the ‘new industrialization’ driving the inflow of high-tech investments to the real economy.Titov is among a few state authorities who openly express their enthusiasm about technology. However, such open-mindedness is not necessarily shared by the majority of his colleagues.Titov says:“We are in opposition to the current economic policy adopted by the government and the Central Bank. Unfortunately, so far the President backs them, but we hope it will change soon.”Interestingly, the Duma (the Russian parliament) clearly distinguishes Blockchain and cryptocurrency designed on the basis of this technology. While giving some space for playing around with the former, there have been several attempts to ban the latter.In December 2015 the Code of Administrative Offences was updated and included  a new chapter introducing an administrative responsibility for operations with pseudo money, implying, in this case digital, currencies. Even though the government was recommended to exclude the chapter from the code, it was decided that the draft of the Code would be revised and maybe even passed by the next calling of the Duma.The Ministry of Finance, with the support of Duma, has been sketching tight regulations since 2014. Suggestions by the Ministry included delegation of additional functions to the Central Bank of Russia for combating even the promotion of use of Bitcoins as a means of payment, and imposition of legal responsibility for the operations with Bitcoin.Following the UK’s decision to leave the EU the race is now on to replace London as the global fintech capital. What are the chances Russia might take on this role?In April 2016 at the Blockchain and Bitcoin conference which took place in Moscow, representatives of foreign Blockchain companies shared their enthusiasm to contribute to the development of technology in the country.Paul Szurek, Head of Strategy&Partnerships at Blockchain said:“Our mission is to reinvent finances, make them adequate to the era of the financial technology revolution and provide people with better access to financial services”.He believes that transparent financial technologies will allow fast, secure and confidential transactions, and it is especially important for countries with a low level of trust towards financial institutions, with Russia being one of these countries.According to Szurek, Russia has a strong potential for the development of innovative payments solutions on the basis of Blockchain. There are currently around 500 000 Blockchain users, and the number is growing.With state support through attractive tax policies, the introduction of slightly more friendly regulations, or even the creation of a single platform for the research and testing of Blockchain in the manner of R3, might increase Russia’s chances in becoming one of the world’s Blockchain leaders.In September 2016 the State Duma will be re-elected. If the Party of Growth gets into the Russian parliament, it could bring fresh perspective to the debates over the development and application of Blockchain.Titov thinks that the internet in Russia is overly controlled with the state authorities imposing too tight regulations. Russia’s internet ombudsman Dmitri Marinichev agrees with his colleague. Earlier this year he said that the Party of Growth will also be working on the draft law defining the cyber space in the country. In his opinion, it is important to develop the infrastructure, attract brilliant, talented and active developers who would be eager to come to Russia to work on their projects. Marinichev strongly criticized laws regulating the internet which are being discussed in the Duma.Lately Blockchain technology has been under scrutiny by businesses and state institutions.Andrey Lugovoy, Deputy at the Commission for Security and anti-corruption said:“Distributed ledger technology drives the progress. As soon as possible Russian businesses should find ways to make it useful for business processes to ensure they keep up with the global financial technology revolution. Blockchain technology is proof that sanctions imposed on Russia facilitate the progress inside the country.”",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #FinTech    #Brexit  
"Bitcoin is Potential National Threat, Says U.S. Regulator",Evander Smart,6/22/2016 11:03,287,19,"The last century of financial regulation within the world’s largest economy, in the United States, has bred a literal treasure chest of regulatory bodies that look more like an alphabet soup than any cohesive form of governance.It is difficult to tell if one made-up group of regulators are just created to boost national employment numbers, protect the proletariat, or to check another set of fact-checkers who guard a larger, established thiefdom.Speaking of thiefdoms, private companies like The Federal Reserve, in association with federal organizations like the SEC and the Treasury Department have crafted a new annual report under a group name called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC. This report focuses on the safety and overall health of the U.S. economic system and has done so for the past five years.This year, Bitcoin and its blockchain technology are featured under the inclusive section labeled “Potential Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities.” To sample the report in its 161-page entirely, click here. In this small ebook of impending economic doom-and-gloom, this is what the cabal had to say about the new technology known in the report as “distributed ledgers,"" or blockchains:“…..Although distributed ledger systems are designed to prevent reporting errors or fraud by a single party, some systems may be vulnerable to fraud executed through collusion among a significant fraction of participants in the system.”When it comes to Bitcoin and what it brings to the table, the FSOC regulators found negative fodder to focus on, referring to the extended blockchain transaction confirmation times.“For example, in recent months, Bitcoin trade confirmation delays have increased dramatically and some trade failures have occurred as the speed with which new Bitcoin transactions are submitted has exceeded the speed with which they can be added to the blockchain.”While it is clear that Bitcoin is no perfect financial panic at the present time, after just seven years serving the world, I would need a few thousand paragraphs to go over the economic errors and strife U.S. regulators and organizations have committed in the same timespan, after a couple of centuries of practice. This report is itself a sample form of a mea culpa of economic issues facing the U.S. both now and in the future.Time for a rhetorical question. Does anyone remember the time when Bitcoin was beneath the scope of the mainstream media, much less U.S. national economic threat reports?This annual report certainly did not mention Bitcoin, or its blockchain technology, 3-4 years ago. Yet, in 2016, they must be included, in their own section, no less.This is no glowing review of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, like the one the Bank of England produced last fall. It seems designed to be more of a more common operational scare tactic for government officials. Alas, you know what they say, “There is no such thing as bad publicity.”The steady progress Bitcoin continues to make into the greater mainstream of macroeconomics reminds me of the famous quote by Mahatma Gandhi. It goes: “First, they ignore you. Then, they laugh at you. Then, they fight you. Then, you win!” Bitcoin seems to be deep into Stage 3 of this natural progression towards its ultimate acceptance.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #SEC  
Swiss Parliament Moves to Deregulate Blockchain Startups,Joël Valenzuela,6/21/2016 11:00,449,520,"Switzerland takes another large step in the direction of a crypto paradise with the introduction of a motion to redefine client deposits, exempting Bitcoin businesses from the stringent financial regulations banks face.Members of the Swiss parliament moved to lessen regulations on Bitcoin- and blockchain-based startups. Federal Assembly member Franz Grüter, along with 23 of his colleagues across several parties, filed the motion last Wednesday (though a vote would likely not take place until the fall).The motion aims to clarify the definition of financial institutions. Currently, companies that handle client money quickly become classified as banking institutions, and are therefore subject to a host of financial regulations.By redefining “client deposits” and exempting cryptocurrency, the motion would lessen the potential regulatory burden facing blockchain startups, the prospect of which has kept out many cryptocurrency exchanges.Last month, the Swiss town of Zug began to accept Bitcoin payments for certain city services, as part of an experimental trial run in integrating cryptocurrency with governance. The trial is set to run for the rest of 2016, and allows citizens to pay up to 200 francs worth of public services in Bitcoin.Zug stands out as an example of success in involving cryptocurrency in government. Earlier this year, legislators in New Hampshire in the United States attempted to pass a bill that would allow Bitcoin payments for taxes. The motion was ultimately tabled and did not succeed.The motion to deregulate blockchain businesses is a further move to position Switzerland at the forefront of the fintech world.The Swiss canton of Zug is known in the cryptocurrency world as home to “crypto valley,” an area containing the headquarters of numerous blockchain companies, including Xapo, Shapeshift, and Ethereum",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Accepted    #Startups    #Switzerland  
Too Big to Fail? Not in the Blockchain World,Jacob J,6/10/2016 13:29,283,181,"Systemic risk in the financial world has increased in recent years due to the interconnected nature of global financial markets. Could the blockchain make a difference in reducing risk associated with failure of global players?The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 shook global financial markets. It reduced investor confidence in banks and contributed to recessions across the world. Interbank lending froze as banks did not have the confidence to place even overnight deposits in their fellow banks. When the fortunes of firms can change in a matter of days, financial statements which are a year old are not helpful in evaluating a firm's financial position.How could the blockchain help? If financial assets (mortgages, bonds, shares) are stored on a blockchain, it would help provide real-time information about a firm's net asset holdings. This information can be used by investors to assess the financial position of a firm and take quick decisions. In the absence of this information, risk-averse investors might shun all firms in times of uncertainty.Real-time information could help regulators assess the financial health of financial institutions which are systemically important, and suggest remedial action if required. Regulators would also be able to assess the impact of the closure of a firm on the financial system. An orderly closure of firms would be possible and no financial institution would be considered “too big to fail”.While the blockchain provides a tool for real time monitoring of complex systems, its effective use depends on the capability of the organizations involved. Mt.Gox couldn't reconcile its total bitcoin balance (a rather simple task) and failed to detect the leakage of bitcoins from its reserves for a period of several months. Its disorderly collapse sent shockwaves through the Bitcoin ecosystem and left thousands of investors in the lurch. An incapable regulator who monitors financial institutions' position on a real-time basis using the blockchain would be ineffective.",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #MT.Gox  
"PSD2 to Accelerate Digital Revolution, Blockchain Adoption",Alicia Naumoff,6/9/2016 11:30,845,221,"Aiming at accelerating innovation and developing a unified payment services sector, the European Commission has adopted the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which is expected to bring vital changes.Lately, regulators have been increasingly focussing on ensuring consumer protection, competition, and security in the area of financial services.The PSD2 is a data and technology-driven directive, which was introduced as a way to respond to the changes in the landscape of payment services since the introduction of the original directive in 2007, and to drive further improvements in payment services across Europe.The revised version includes a number of changes and enhancements to the original paper, with the main goal of providing clarity, efficiency and ease-of-use of European payment services.The directive significantly extends the scope of the original PSD regulations beyond Europe and revises the definition of a ‘Payment Institution.’Other features of the reform package include: new rules on access to payment accounts, liability allocation provisions, transparency requirements and customer authentication measures.The clauses included in the directive reflect the growing number of account aggregators - businesses that enable customers to access different online banking accounts including credit cards, current and savings accounts using a single online portal, and other fintech companies starting in the payments services sector.According to the directive, under the new regime, businesses which provide and maintain customer’s payment accounts are required to give certain third parties which have a license to provide payment services access to customers' account information, providing the customer has given their explicit consent to that access.The right of customers to be provided with information which properly informs them about the extent of their access is also extended.Under the new regulation, payment services are banned from placing restrictions on third-party account information access. In addition, payment services are prohibited from treating payments which go through third-parties differently (e.g. applying added charges, treating them as being of lower priority, etc.) from those which come directly from customers.Separate provisions have been included to cover payments made under framework contracts which provide for a series of payment transactions and those which do not.Now both the payer and payee in a transaction are entitled to receive information from their respective payment service providers about the charges applied to transactions. EU countries are also required to ensure payment service users are given information on any charges or interest applied.Before each transaction, under a framework contract payment service, providers are required to provide customers with explicit information on the maximum execution time and the charges payable by the payer and, where applicable, a breakdown of the amounts of any charges.  The directive contains significant restrictions of rules on payment service user authentication, with the purpose of ensuring that payment service providers  can be confident that the people using their services are who they say they are. Therefore, payment service providers are required to apply strong customer authentication when payers initiate an electronic payment transaction.The proposals, however, would allow the European Banking Authority (EBA) the scope to set guidelines on exemptions to this general rule.Given that security measures are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, and that they are constantly driving towards a frictionless experience for consumers, some conflict between the direction that industry and regulators wish to travel in is expected.It is still unclear if, or to what extent, consumers will benefit from the mandated security procedures given that the liability provisions largely protect consumers from loss. Payment service providers who fail to apply strong customer authentication for payments made online or over the phone cannot require payers to bear any financial consequences unless those payers themselves act fraudulently. In all circumstances where strong customer authentication is required, the Council said payment service providers must adopt specific security requirements to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service users’ personalised security credentials.The financial sector is one of the most complicated and highly regulated, therefore it might be hard for many to greet the introduction of new rules with open arms. At first sight it might seem that regulators have made the rules of the game stricter and forcibly unveiled the backstage of payment services scene. On the other hand, PSD2 certainly expands the space for development for financial institutions, once they embrace adopted regulations and revise their growth strategies.Regulators actually give banks and financial institutions a golden opportunity to accelerate the digital revolution they ought to embrace - not for the sake of compliance, but for the sake of growth. Some large players of the fintech arena have already started making use of the new regulatory framework.Yobie Benjamin from Token shared his perspective at Arctic15,  in Helsinki last week:“We have always been interested in building the next generation global payment system, and the opportunity showed itself with the introduction of PSD2. The European financial sector unites around 19,000 registered banks, which are regulated by the European Central Bank. Now all of them are required to open up their system for other players with the aim of increasing regulation and competition. It would be silly not to use the opportunity to ensure development of the sector. We decided to team up and write software for compliance with PSD2”.Yobie explains that the most magic was in the fact that in order to comply with the new regulatory framework, all European banks have to be connected to one single system.Working on the software, the team found out that connecting all registered European banks, large American and Chinese banks automatically connect to the system as well, since they all operate in Europe. Therefore, they basically created the basis for a new global payment system.One lesson can be drawn here - if earlier financial institutions had doubts as tp whether to go digital or not, the directive basically forces them to start doing things differently.Players in the fintech arena now have the chance to go ‘all in’ and excel at creating the new experiences possible in the new digital market context.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #PSD2  
"Regulations Force Uber, Lyft out of Austin, Arcade City Moves In",Joël Valenzuela,5/15/2016 11:10,252,1220,"Ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft have ceased operations in the city of Austin, Texas due to government regulations. Arcade City, decentralized ride-sharing company, has commenced operations in Austin to fill the void left by the two outgoing ridesharing companies.The city of Austin passed an ordinance requiring more stringent background checks, including fingerprinting, for ridesharing. Proposition 1, a ballot initiative meant to overturn the ordinance, failed. As a result, both Uber and Lyft have since ceased operations in Austin.Christopher David, CEO of Arcade City, a ridesharing service that grew out of a Bitcoin-funded swarm activism campaign and plans for Ethereum integration later this year, sees the city’s ordinance as an outdated measure that will fail at holding back business innovation.“Austin claims to be a hub for innovation. Let’s see how they grapple with the inevitable irrelevance of corporations and governments thanks to the disintermediation revolution. Highly connected peer-to-peer ecosystems that harness the wisdom of crowds can self-organize and self-govern better than some arbitrary third-party ever could. We really will ‘decentralize all the things’. The only question is whether the centralists will stand aside or actively resist the change.”Arcade City, which is in the middle of an app update, announced on their website their intention to go into Austin specifically because Uber and Lyft were pulling out. Many newly out of work ridesharing employees have joined on with Arcade City, which uses its decentralized nature, combined with a tipping or by-donation model, to avoid the city’s ordinance.According to David, this is the beginning of a new wave in business and technology that regulators will be unable to effectively stop.“Uber was the honey badger of 'ridesharing 1.0'. Laws didn’t fit their model yet they operated anyway, eventually building enough consumer support to force changes in the laws. I’m sure bureaucrats are tiring of the constant battle, but the real battle is only beginning. Central intermediaries who maintain their position through force of law will see their influence erode across every sector of business and governance. In Arcade City we’re excited to push that evolution forward as we pioneer decentralized ‘ridesharing 2.0’.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Uber    #Lyft    #Arcade City    #Austin    #Texas  
"US to Crack Down on ""Dirty Money"": Time to Use Bitcoin Instead",Joël Valenzuela,5/11/2016 11:05,724,119,"US launches new measures against tax evasion, money laundering, and terrorism in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal. Time to switch to Bitcoin to maintain your privacy.In an effort to curb illicit financial transactions, the US Department of Treasury announced a tightening on financial regulations last week. This involved amending the US Bank Secrecy Act in order to prevent money from being hidden in offshore companies.The first rule change is targeted at shell corporations, and would require the disclosure of the true owners and would not allow their identity to be protected through lawyers or other appointed figureheads meant to obfuscate ownership.The second rule, which at this point is still a proposal, would have the intended effect of preventing foreign nationals from hiding their assets in the United States.Although an official for the Treasury claimed the rule changes were not related, they do come less than a month after the Panama Papers scandal revealed scores of politicians, celebrities, athletes, and other wealthy individuals hiding their money in foreign accounts.Many of the world’s elite were found to have created shell corporations in Panama through the law firm Mossack Fonseca for the purposes of hiding wealth and avoiding taxes, including several prominent politicians who have ironically advocated for their citizens to pay their fair share in taxes.Privacy-conscious consumers should switch to using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is online and pseudonymous, and, as such, is not tied to any specific person or geographical location.Other cryptocurrencies such as Dash provide further security features, including coin-mixing, which renders transactions very difficult to trace.In order to acquire cryptocurrency without divulging personal or financial information, there are several methods of avoiding online exchanges: attending a local Bitcoin meetup and buying privately for cash, using a Bitcoin ATM (or BTM), or using a decentralized peer-to-peer exchange like Wall of Coins.",1,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Money Laundering    #Mossack Fonseca    #Privacy  
Bitstamp: The First Licensed Bitcoin Exchange of Europe,Jacob J,5/5/2016 15:04,905,159,"Bitstamp has received a license from Luxembourg to operate as a payment institution, making it Europe’s first licensed bitcoin exchange.Could this extra legitimacy open up bitcoin as an asset class to an untapped customer base?In January 2015, Bitstamp suffered a hack which resulted in the loss of ~19,000 BTC (valued at around $5 Mn).The Company recovered quickly, supported by ample reserves in cold storage.Bitstamp added additional security measures, which included multi-signature wallets provided by BitGo and moving its servers to Amazon's AWS cloud infrastructure.These measures, coupled with commission-free trades helped Bitstamp retain its customers.There have been other issues with Bitstamp, including a BitGo bug revealing Bitstamp deposit and withdrawal information in May 2015.  The licence has been granted to Bitstamp after a review of its security procedures (spanning 2 years) in addition to an audit by Ernst & Young, Luxembourg.Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg’s Minister of Finance, tweets:Glad to sign the payment institution license for @bitstamp, the latest addition to #Luxembourg's #fintech ecosystem pic.twitter.com/SG1HFxOslEBitstamp will now be a regulated exchange in the whole of Europe.The licence seeks to assure Bitstamp customers that the exchange offers the highest level of security and consumer protection, previously available only to customers of traditional financial institutions.Other exchanges operating in Europe have a clear roadmap in front of them, for assuring their customers of their strong security practices.The licence granted to Bitstamp could encourage new customers to invest in bitcoins.Those people who had become skeptical about security practices of these new age firms (after regular news about hackings and stolen bitcoins) could be tempted to try Bitstamp.While the number of coins purchased purely due to this licence may not be significant enough to move bitcoin’s price, the licensing of Bitstamp could improve the confidence of the larger public in Bitcoin and in bitcoin exchanges.Gemini, itBit and Circle have all played a part in improving the public’s perception of Bitcoin by working with regulators.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitstamp    #Europe    #Bitcoin Exchanges  
Ghana’s Anti-Money Laundering Body Cites Virtual Currency Use as National Security Risk,Olusegun Ogundeji,4/30/2016 18:00,468,74,"Ghana’s Financial Intelligence Centre says the use of virtual markets and virtual currencies such as bitcoin and kitiwa is a severe risk to the country’s security.The assessment is based on available international records that show insurgencies have been funded from Ghana.Saddled with combating money laundering and terrorist financing, the centre is now working to make Ghana the first country in West Africa to publish its national risk assessment.The country will also undergo the second phase of a regional mutual evaluation against money laundering in its readiness to fight the crime, added the centre’s CEO, Samuel Essel.The assessment, designed in September 2014 to prevent money laundering and combat terrorist financing, is in line with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for countries to identify, assess, and understand money laundering and combat terrorist financing risks within their jurisdiction and then take action and apply resources to mitigate them.More African countries are moving towards a cashless economy and more Africans are using Bitcoin particularly for its ease of use and transparency features.Nethertheless, official statements that tie various electronic payment platforms including bitcoin to money laundering and terrorism financing create doubts in the larger population that is yet to understand the disruptive tendency of the digital currency.The situation has been worsened by the several plans mentioned by African governments to regulate bitcoin use across the region through relevant institutions with none having achieved anything concrete yet.Rather, lingering talks of impending policies have become another factor that has added to the low level of public awareness about bitcoin to aid lack of interest in Africa’s growing fintech sector. In a position paper on virtual currencies by the South African Reserve Bank, it described Bitcoin, LiteCoin and Ripple as decentralised virtual currencies, stressing that there is potential for real growth of bitcoin in its current operational environment. However, the bank added that the currencies are not legal tender to be used as payment for the discharge of any obligation in a manner that suggests they are perfect substitute of legal tender in any part of the country.The situation is the same in Kenya with Apex bank stating in December that no entity is currently licensed to offer money remittance services and products in Kenya using virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. In Africa’s largest economy, Nigeria, its central bank has indicated its intention to regulate bitcoin use in the country specifically to deter its potential use for money laundering and terrorist financing.All these are coming at a time when the world’s largest money transfer firm, Western Union, is investing in Digital Currency Group which supports bitcoin and blockchain startups, so as to keep its “eye on innovation” according to Western Union’s chief technology officer, David Thompson. Hence, it is believed that, with time, bitcoin validation from Western Union and other such global firms will improve awareness among Africa’s tech-savvy generation and mitigate the various layers of negativity about the digital currency.Reassuringly, ongoing private sector initiatives will complement such efforts. In Ghana, for example, the FIC CEO mentioned the use of Bitcoin and Kitiwa as some of the most used mediums for money laundering since they use peer-to-peer technology with no central authority.Still, some bitcoin-related projects have emanated from the country to global commendations – it had a workable DIY land title recorded on a developed and tested blockchain last year by Bitnation and the country produced the first company to create a bitcoin-producing farm this year.However, whether and when a possible collaboration could be achieved among relevant stakeholders – and if such cooperation would settle the identified differences – for a common understanding of issues surrounding the growing use of bitcoin in Africa and other parts of the world will only be determined with time.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Africa    #Cryptocurrencies    #Economy    #Ghana    #Security  
Bitcoin Lightning Network: Can It Provide Privacy for the Masses?,Andrew Quentson,4/29/2016 11:26,1205,6,"Bitcoin was originally thought to be fully anonymous and in its early days it probably was. However, as most moved from mining Bitcoin to buying, systemic entry points, or exchanges, sprang up.As a ledger history was created, known addresses, often those belonging to Bitcoin exchanges, became, in effect, de-anonymising tools.When Bitcoin became more prominent and popular, regulators took enforcement action.The community’s pushback secured no regulation of the protocol itself, but Bitcoin exchanges were forced to comply with numerous financial regulations.Although Bitcoin addresses are made of random letters and numbers, each address is unique. Once ownership of the address is revealed, everyone can see all the transactions it performed.If, therefore, that address received or deposited to a known illegal or even undesirable (as regulators deem it) service provider, exchanges may freeze the account or deny service as well as perhaps or rather likely share data with third parties.If all exchanges or service providers share their data with a central entity, then it may be possible to track most transactions with reasonable confidence as the centralized points (exchanges or service providers) shed light on what likely occurred when the transaction is onchain.One method to retain privacy is to use a new address every time a new transaction is made.However, one could easily assume such action was performed, especially if subsequent transactions re-inforce the assumption in one way or another.There are mixing services, like coinjoin, which pools different amounts, mixes them all together and sends them off to different addresses, as well as other methods.However, would non-technical users be able or willing to spend time and effort into employing such methods?Should they, therefore, be incorporated in the protocol itself and if they are, how would regulators, which are currently engaged in an intense fight with Apple in the so-called crypto wars 2.0, react?Many companies, including Apple, are now employing end to end encryption and other cryptographic methods which provide full privacy for the masses.For Bitcoin, the answer is slightly more complex. Although methods have been suggested, such as Confidential Transactions or a Zerocash sidechain, some suggest that sending transactions off-chain to the Lightning Network may be the answer.In a short interview Peter Todd states:“The Lightning Network inherently means that less information about transactions ends up in the public blockchain, which makes anti-privacy coin tracking efforts like Chainalysis much less effective; Chainalysis is a perfect example of a company whose business will likely be wiped out entirely by Lightning.”As most transactions would occur off-chain, there would be no global ledger of transactions to track. However, it is not clear how much privacy within Lightning transactions would provide as Lombrozo states that it is not yet decided what algorithm Lightning will use.Lombrozo says:“You could use onion routing (like tor) so that hubs don't know the original source and destination. If you directly connect to the counterparty then you could use encrypted messages and nobody but the two of you would know about any of your transactions.” However, onion routing has trade-offs as “it tends to be slow and relatively inefficient.”While tor is a valuable tool, it has seen little adoption, primarily because it is slow. Moreover, many websites have taken action to deny access to tor users, thus increasing inconvenience.It may well be the case therefore that “several different routing algorithms will be used for different purposes” with most, probably, using the Firefox version of Lightning and the tor onion routing version.This ensures privacy for those who spend time and effort, comparable to the use of the inconvenient PGP tool today.The level of privacy for the rest, if any, is unclear with some suggesting that as scale is achieved, Lightning hubs would be able to see all transactions, comparable to exchanges and like exchanges can deny service if they so wish.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Lightning Network    #Privacy    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Transactions  
China Tightens Online Finance Regulations,Jacob J,4/22/2016 14:15,317,25,"China has suspended registration of new businesses with finance-related names, saying that these firms first need approvals from financial regulators. What effects will these measures have on the Chinese fintech competitive space?The restrictions imposed are part of the Government's measures to restrict the proliferation of online financial companies. According to reports citing Caixin, a Chinese magazine, the crackdown is expected to last one year and is expected to focus on P2P lending, crowdfunding, online insurance, etc.The reasons given for the crackdown include failure of P2P lending sites which has resulted in thousands of investors losing their money. Aggressive online financing is also suspected of fueling increase in housing prices and share prices in the past. The crackdown involves multiple government agencies and is led by the People’s Bank of China.The online P2P lending platform Ezubo was one of China's largest investment frauds, resulting in 900,000 investors losing a total of $7.6 billion through a classic ponzi scheme.The platform shut shop in December 2015 and had resulted in the Chinese regulators increasing the scrutiny on online finance firms.Over 95% of the investment projects which were listed on Ezubo are suspected to be fake and investigations into the company are still ongoing.The Chinese regulators have a strong dislike for investment bubbles, since large scale losses incurred by investors can lead to social unrest.Unlike the laissez-faire attitude of western nations, the Chinese believe in strong regulation to prevent bubbles from running for too long.In 2013, during Bitcoin's bull run, the Chinese regulators had implemented multiple measures including  banning third party payment processors from doing business with bitcoin exchanges and barring financial institutions from processing bitcoins.The measures had the desired effect, resulting in a cooling down of bitcoin's price.The crackdown on internet finance companies could result in foreign companies, looking to set up new investment businesses, going slow on their plans. In the long run, more oversight of financial companies is likely to benefit the sector, weeding out fly-by-night operators and increasing investor confidence.Existing large players like Alipay and Tencent are also likely to benefit from increased regulation, given their established nature and financial depth.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #P2P    #Fintech  
Technology of Tomorrow: Is Physical Currency Going Extinct?,Iyke Aru,4/21/2016 14:30,498,190,"Today’s infrastructure cannot accommodate on a global level for the technology of tomorrow, says our expert Brandon Kostinuk of Vanbex. However, progressive policies supported by global economic players can rapidly change that.Lisa Cheng, Vanbex Group CEO, who has years of experience dealing with Bitcoin and blockchain technology, says:“To begin usurping traditional models of banking and finance we have to move society beyond our current understanding of currency and see that it exists today as digital value. Paper currency is on its way out and will be replaced entirely by digital forms.”According Brandon Kostinuk, we are already in a globalized economy with digital assets floating everywhere. Even traditional banks, as it’s well known, store money electronically as financial information in databases.Countries like Barbados, Peru and Ecuador have already leaped passed conjecture, concurrently offering a digital variation alongside their physical currency. Citizens there use digital currency for everyday items like groceries and fuel for their car, facilitated by smartphone technology.Governments worldwide from the U.K. to China, Australia to Canada, are all looking at ways to develop, adopt and adapt to disruptive financial technology (fintech) to progressively move with the shifting sands pressed on society by the Internet-based economy.At its most reductive core, intangible assets need a physical carrier and that’s where the discussion of hardware wallets — devices that store a part of a user's wallet for digital currency securely in mostly-offline hardware — enters the fray.Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England, says:“Currently, deposits are backed mainly by illiquid loans, assets that can’t be sold on open markets; if we all tried simultaneously to close our accounts, banks wouldn’t have the liquid resources to meet the demand.”Just a decade ago, it’s safe to say most of mankind didn’t even know a thing like cryptocurrency existed, which, even before Bitcoin, it did.There was E-gold, which launched in 1996 and, as the name suggests, was a digital currency backed by gold. Ten years later, Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rica-based centralized digital currency, was founded as an exchange.However, both enterprises went down the path of criminal activity, specifically money laundering.The digital currency - a cryptocurrency - created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 reshaped the conversation. It changed the way money, the way a currency, was thought of and its underlying Blockchain technology, a decentralized virtual clearinghouse and asset registry, as described by Broadbent last month, is gearing up to change the very financial structure of the globalized economy.Bitcoin represents, in market cap today, over USD $6 billion. It has spawned an industry, from exchanges and financial services to infrastructure, gambling, news media and more. Much more.The now infamous Mt. Gox “hack,” an episode that came to light in April 2014, showed the world security against malicious intent was of paramount concern when it came to digital currency (and that could be said of any form of money).Launched in 2010, the Tokyo-based exchange, the largest at the time, eventually handled around 70 percent of all Bitcoin transactions at the height of operations in 2013.The total amount said to have been stolen hovered around $450 million (around 850,000 bitcoins).According to WizSec lead investigator, Kim Nilsson, ""most or all of the missing bitcoins were stolen straight out of the MtGox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011.""The need for secure, offline storage was apparent then and that need is no less great today.“Blockchain security has advanced much quicker than you would see in traditional banking,” Darin Stanchfield told CNBC’s On the Money.The KeepKey CEO was commenting on the Bangladesh bank hack that occurred at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where $100 million was reportedly stolen from the government’s account.Stanchfield explained, with a device like the hardware wallet (or a vault), credentials are presented to the Federal Reserve in order to move money. These credentials would be presented when the device is first initialized and those credentials don’t ever leave the device.This is in contrast to any ‘hot wallet’ and is the most effective standard to safeguard against hackers in the cryptographic age of computer security. Something offline can’t be invaded by external elements.But nations and their laws and regulations move at different speeds, especially when it comes to adoption of emerging technology.One of the most vibrant fintech hubs in the world exists in the U.K. with London’s ecosystem of startups and companies generating £6.6 billion ($9.4 billion) in revenue and attracted £524 million (over $700 million) in investment in 2015, according to accounting firm Ernst & Young.The study occurred because it was commissioned by the U.K. government. The British government is a leading example of progressive policy-making within the fintech sector and is the primary reason it is home to the fast-growing sector in the country.Ernst & Young further reported that the sector employs 61,000 people (5% of the total financial services workforce). More people are working in the U.K. fintech scene than in New York, or in the combined FinTech workforce of Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.In March 2015, HM Treasury — the government arm responsible for developing and executing public finance policy and economic policy in Britain — also published a report, stating, in response to the emerging fintech sector “the government intends to apply anti-money laundering regulation to digital currency exchanges, to support innovation and prevent criminal use.”Further, the government has been discussing the possibility and implications of issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC).Deputy Governor Broadbent states:“It seems very unlikely that, to any significant extent, we’ll ever be paying for things in bitcoins, rather than pounds, dollars or euros. The more important issue for central banks considering such a move [to issue digital currency] will be what it might mean for the funding of banks and the supply of credit.”The government in the UK, at least those in control of the nation’s monetary policy, is already thinking about implications, structural and otherwise, of appropriating digital currency.The conversation has leaped from opposition into adoption and it very much has to do with the underlying backbone of Nakamoto’s creation, touted as the next evolutionary step to the Internet.Part and parcel of the talked of and trialed evolution of the financial layer of industrialized societies is blockchain technology. This is where transactions are created, recorded and preserved in a secure, decentralized structure.The Internet economy has sprung the need to advance financial interactions the same way it has developed new ways of considering technology and conducting business altogether.The most practical concern, that of safely securing and using digital currency, is a phenomenon which is itself being worked and re-worked in regard to the implications outlined by Broadbent and others, like Financial Stability Board chairman and Bank of England governor, Mark Carney.But amid the pursuit, by Microsoft and IBM, to bring blockchain tools and enterprise access to  the market, along with the corporate race to build the blockchain of all blockchains for the financial services and banking industry, among other interested parties, it’s clear: digital currency is here and hardware wallets will be as ubiquitous to everyday life as smartphones.And as digital currency becomes commonplace, granted the technological and regulatory environment catches up, hardware wallets will be a vital instrument, used daily by individuals.Doug Miller, head of business development at KeepKey, the Washington-based maker of one of the few premium hardware wallets on the market today, explained, security and user-friendliness were core factors in their device’s design.Miller says:“It has to be simple and it can’t be complicated. What we wanted to do was streamline the process for use in an everyday aspect.""With KeepKey, a typical transaction doesn’t involve the computer client storing private keys and signing transactions. The computer client will pass transactions to KeepKey, request they be signed and the user signs for it on their end, following the on-screen demands legible on the a 3.12” OLED.It is, ostensibly, a private, offline bank account for digital currency.Setup and installation is conducted online, using Chrome extensions, and can be completed within a matter of seconds.Jordan Tuwiner, 21, who founded the site BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com, a resource for topics related to Bitcoin, has been involved in using digital currency and hardware wallets for the past two years.“A hardware wallet is pretty much what the average person will want to secure their Bitcoin."" said Tuwiner, adding, when searching for the right wallet, “The most important thing is to consider what you’re using the device for. If you’re serious about it, do your research.""The ecosystem of products is expanding and so are the advantages and disadvantages to each of the products on retail today.Tuwiner added, among the devices he used, KeepKey was quite easy to setup and install and is a good choice for novices and aficionados alike.“We look at ourselves as a hardware company for the blockchain and that’s our long-term vision,"" said Miller.His future-thinking objective illustrates a key perception, that the financial world is in a transitional state, one that moves beyond traditional institutions and legacy systems to deliver peer-to-peer transactions, self-executing contracts and best of all, a reduction in costs for financial institutions through to consumers.Companies “for the blockchain”, like KeepKey, is the global paradigm shift currently developing, and, in a reductive sense, hardware wallets are the core construct to establishing real-world connectivity to intangible financial innovation.Further, it offers the 21st century security and a level playing field where conditions for theft and fraud exist behind an interweaving mesh of 0s, 1s and coexisting protocols.",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Vanbex Group    #FinTech    #Economy    #Security    #KeepKey    #Bitcoin Wallet  
"Top Bitcoin Insiders Clandestinely Work with EU, Leaked Emails Show",Cyril Gilson,4/20/2016 14:30,486,76,"Ex Bitcoin Foundation Outreach Person Monica Monaco and her regulatory antics exposed in leaked e-mails. Is EU digital currency regulation being driven by Bitcoin insider lobbying?Cointelegraph gained access to certain emails sent out by Monica Monaco of TrustEUAffairs, which claims to operate in the regulatory affairs consultancy services arena.We are now releasing excerpts into the public domain to showcase how certain parties are working closely together with The European Union (EU) amid a backdrop of terrorist attacks to bring forth increased regulation.Before we released this article we sent out some questions to various Members of the European Parliament and got no response.  The purpose of this article is to showcase the close nexus between Bitcoin insiders and legislators in Brussels and how a very few people are driving policy on virtual currencies, which may affect a whole emerging technology and several of us.Legislation is often the result of wheeling and dealing and lobbying is certainly something that is a time-honoured tradition. The European Parliament based in Brussels is certainly not immune to it either. It is in fact considered a positive activity by the EU’s own publications.“The main criticism of the current situation regarding lobbying is the lack of transparency. Meanwhile lobbying is considered a positive element by EU policy-makers insofar as it ensures the participation of social and economic actors in the policy-making process and provides useful information.”  So when you read this article, this is no way a critique of either lobbying or lobbyists but more so an exposure of the shady backroom dealings of certain people who have formed themselves into workgroups and are exerting pressure in order to gain legitimacy in the eyes of traditional bankers and financial services providers.Monica Monaco is certainly no stranger to virtual currencies or the European Union; after all she was hired by Bitcoin Foundation itself to establish a working relationship with the EU.At her former employer Visa, she spent a great deal of time as a Manager for EU relations and regulatory affairs. Maybe it is her time at Bitcoin Foundation that enables her to speak with a great deal of confidence when she recently told bankingtech.com:“This is the first time I’ve worked for an industry that wants regulations.”Ms. Monaco and her friends seem to have appropriated an industry-wide voice on the issue. In an email that we have which originated from her official account at the domain trusteuaffairs.com on January 27, 2016, she lays the groundwork for a second meeting on February 10, 2016 at Science 14 Atrium, rue de la Science 14b in Brussels.The recipients of this mail include people like Marcel Roelants of bitpay.com, Laurent Kratz of neofacto.com and Michael Gronager of chainanlysis.com and several others.The meeting was supposedly to be held between her clients that include the recipients and a delegation from the European Parliament, which included the shadow rapporteurs.She claims in her email that a detailed agenda was to be circulated a week before the meeting on February 10 and asks the recipients about who all would be participating.The mail has a MS Word document as an attachment, which contains inputs, which were sent to the European Parliament by her and were constructed on the advice of her ‘working group’.Ms. Monaco is pushing the idea that somehow getting virtual currencies in a regulatory framework would legitimise their operation and allow players to be accepted by their peers in the financial services industry.Her inputs to the European Parliament are quite specific and we quote:“AML/Consumer Protection laws should be applied to the activities/functions being played out in this industry may prove more beneficial to the virtual currencies industry. This would incentivise early ecosystem participants to build out such controls and practices, as most of the industry players are already doing and continue to strengthen.”The terror attacks in Paris and Brussels could not have come at a better time for these champions of Bitcoin regulations.In a later email dated February 1, Ms. Monaco indulges in a bit of namedropping and goes on to say to her ‘workgroup’, “On a different note, I just had coffee with a contact from the European Commission DG FISMA. I understand they are going to publish this week –very likely tomorrow, the 2nd of February- an Action Plan on anti terrorism, following the Council announcement in December after the 13th of November terrorists attacks in Paris”.This email also has an attachment that includes her summary of the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affair’s Public Hearing on Virtual Currencies that was held on January 25, 2016 between 1500-1630 hrs. This hearing was held for preparing an upcoming own-initiative (INI) report from the European Parliament (Rapporteur: Jakob von Weizsaecker, S&D/DE). The panellists included representatives from the European Commission (DG FISMA) and the ECB as well as academia and stakeholders from the private sector.In submissions to Mr Jakob von Weizsaecker MEP (S&D, Germany), Rapporteur for the European Parliament - INI Report on digital currencies, Ms. Monaco explains in great detail about how the US deals with suspicions financial dealings and how they are reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the Department of Treasury.Here is an excerpt in her own words, “All money services business (MSB) - businesses that transmit or convert money, hence both banks and non-banks financial institutions - need to monitor and report suspicious activity.”  What is alarming though is that Ms. Monica and her friends instead of being constructive and creating an European solution for Europe want to impose a US system on a whole continent full of different countries and cultures. She advises the MEP under the header Desirable outcome of the Report, “Some minimum reporting compliance elements –such for example the system in place in the USA – could prove helpful.”When people like Ms. Monica and her friends are the voice of the virtual currency and Bitcoin community, there will always be more of the same old.Her years of working with regulators give her the idea that only regulations can bring about acceptability.The broader agenda that she and her friends have is to somehow remove the ‘tarnish’ of operating in an ‘unregulated’ sphere for her clients and make them one with the old boys’ network of the banking industry.She is certainly not shy about it either as she writes in her concluding remarks, “This would not only help to build the ecosystem, but foster prudent and good players. Furthermore, such a communication coming from the European Parliament should also help players obtaining banking accounts, further contributing to building trust in the banking sector for the virtual currencies industry.”Maybe Ms. Monica needs to understand that there are no ‘good boys’ and ‘bad boys’ but the fact that the virtual currency realm is the work of several independent people who aimed to create a decentralised model that could sustain itself due to the work of the people involved.The Bitcoin community does not crave legitimacy and is by design open and transparent. Her work to bring in more regulations is undermining the very structure of independent fintech.However we can understand that it is very difficult for someone like her to come up with “out of the box” ideas or to propagate them to the powers that be in the EU, a job for which she was hired in the first place not so long ago.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Monica Monaco    #Brussel  
Could Iceland Embrace Crypto Before Anyone Else?,Joël Valenzuela,4/18/2016 14:50,352,136,"It has been a rough decade for Iceland. Between the crash of three major banks to the prime minister’s resignation over corruption revealed by the Panama Papers, the insular island nation has experienced a heavy dose of failure in its most essential systems of governance. This curse, however, could turn into a blessing, as Iceland is uniquely positioned to take full advantage of cryptocurrency like no other nation.Back in 2008, Iceland’s three major banks collapsed, ushering in a corresponding economic collapse and prompting the heads of said banks to be jailed.In the country where common folks were forced to still use the failing króna and you need a permission to buy foreign currency for your holiday plane ticket, the revelation came that their prime minister had finances in offshore accounts. No wonder it has reopened fresh wounds from barely eight years earlier.As a result, the relatively new and radical Pirate Party has already taken the lead in Iceland’s polls.Rather than a tale of corruption, outrage, and justice, however, what Iceland’s struggles really underscore is the complete failure of central banking and capital controls, illuminated intimately as only possible in a small island nation of barely 300,000. And, regrettably, the government appears to be doubling down on its mistakes.Not only were the three bankers who were jailed in response to the 2008 collapse recently released from jail after serving only a fraction of their sentences, incoming Prime Minister Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson supports legislation banning Iceland’s citizens from keeping their money abroad in tax havens.Instead of learning from the errors of the past, Icelandic officials seem hell-bent on repeating them.As a solution to the banking system and the devalued króna, an anonymous development team created Auroracoin, a cryptocurrency meant specifically for the people of Iceland, and was distributed to them directly.The initial distribution saw a price spike and crash, caused by the collision of a swell of anticipation with an inadequate infrastructure for using and trading the cryptocurrency. The Auroracoin Foundation, however, plans a resurgence for the coin this year, as its price and transaction volume continue to spike in response to the country’s recent financial woes.The troubles the people of Iceland have had to endure at the hands of a government completely unresponsive to real change could end up working in their favor.National cryptocurrencies provide a meaningful alternative to the central banking system, allow a people to gather equity instead of debt, and have a more focused distribution model than general purpose cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.Since 10% of Iceland’s population already holds Auroracoin, an opportunity for a whole nation to embrace cryptocurrency has never been easier to grasp. Whether or not its people seize this unique chance remains to be seen.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Iceland    #Cryptocurrencies    #Auroracoin    #Banks  
"European Parliament Takes Initiative to Put Cryptocurrency, Blockchain on Fast Track",Niall Maye,4/17/2016 12:26,532,581,"Things are moving quickly in Europe at the moment in regards to cryptocurrency and the Blockchain. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament scheduled to vote on the virtual currencies report in a matter of days, with the hot summer for cryptocurrency and Blockchain legislation ahead.In February, the Council of the European Union put virtual currencies on top of a list of targeted areas for rapid progress which led to the topic of digital currencies rising up the ladder of policy agenda in all major institutions.A new independent non-profit trade body providing thorough regulatory understanding of virtual currencies Brussels-based European Digital Currency & Blockchain Technology Forum (EDCAB) has launched in response to this increased interest.Created as a public policy platform for digital currencies and distributed ledger technologies it is co-organising a flagship industry expo for policymakers in the European Parliament from 18 to 21 April 2016.An event that consists of just three roundtables moderated by the founder of the EDCAB Siân Jones for industry and policymakers with representatives from the IMF, World Bank, United Nations, OECD, Bank for International Settlements, Barclays, NASDAQ, Blockchain.info and Circle Internet Financial all in attendence in the European Parliament of Brussels for discussions focusing on virtual currencies is a sign of times.The European Parliament is preparing its own initiative report on virtual currencies, with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs scheduled to vote on the report on 25th April 2016.The European Commission has been considering regulation of virtual currencies through its Action Plan and proposals to combat terrorist financing, with legislation expected to be ready by the end of June.The newly formed EDCAB intents to shape a sound regulatory and policy agenda for virtual currencies and Blockchain technology in Europe, with EU policymakers, legislators, regulators, and law enforcement in mind.Founder Siân Jones said: ""For a strong and comprehensive policy and regulatory framework, collaboration based on in-depth understanding of the technology and open debate is vital. The creation of EDCAB signals the industry's commitment to work with policymakers over the long term to achieve positive outcomes for the sector and the European citizens it serves.”The forum is established as a safe environment in which views can be exchanged and to ensure policy decisions are made in full knowledge of the digital currency and blockchain-industry from a business perspective.Membership is open to non-profit organisations, academic and research institutions, businesses and anyone with an interest in digital currencies and Blockchain technology.Clearly this is a sign of just how close cryptocurrencies are to breaking through to the mainstream and there can only be positive outcomes from all these meetings and reports due to be completed by the end of June.

"Bitcoin Must Be Regulated, Panama Papers Scandal Exposes",Iyke Aru,4/16/2016 16:20,438,48,"The true meaning of decentralisation might be that a decentralized currency actually does require centralization. Cointelegraph speaks to Brandon Kostinuk of the Vanbex Group to look into the “common confusion”.It is Kostinuk who calls it “a common confusion”. He explains that in the financial world the realization of a decentralized system, one without a central clearing house or authority to act as the intermediary between transactions, is an ideal proposition for anonymity and personal privacy.Kostinuk argues that the above described arrangement is not a practical approach to financial governance in the 21st century, not with data already present on money laundering and other illicit financial activity.In its 2015 Anti-Money Laundering Index, the Basel Institute on Governance, an independent not-for-profit competence centre that specializes in corruption prevention, public governance, anti-money laundering and more, reported on the the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing of countries worldwide.The Basel Institute used 14 different indicators that deal with Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, corruption, financial standards, political disclosure and rule of law to aggregate an overall score, which is then used to compile an index rated from highest risk to the lowest.In examination of the top 10 on their list, the Basel Institute concludes:“The majority of high-risk countries are characterized by intrinsic weaknesses in both preventing and enforcing multiple aspects of the AML/CFT framework.”Reasons raised refer to structural and functional vulnerabilities such as high rates of perceived corruption, lack of judicial strength, but also, and most relevant to the subject here, a lack of resources to control the financial system, and lack of public and financial transparency.Kostinuk points out that to enable the kind of security, trust and level playing field a public-use financial system requires, it must be accessible to overseers.Further, that process, along with the system itself, must be as open and transparent as necessary to regulate and enforce against illicit activity.To push further his argument, Kostinuk makes reference to R3CEV’s announcement, which he describes as “an announcement in the waiting, the logical progression for the financial sector.”In this announcement contains the opinion that to make the step toward adopting next generation technology, that technology can’t mean a fatal disruption of such a prominent pillar within the global system.Further, it’s the technology, not the semantics attached and associated, that is most important.R3 is reverse-engineering, tackling the problem of adapting blockchain technology to fit to current constraints and frameworks.Richard G. Brown, chief technology officer at R3, writes:""We are not building a blockchain. Unlike other designs in this space, our starting point is individual agreements between firms. We reject the notion that all data should be copied to all participants, even if it is encrypted.""Maintaining a decentralized structure, R3’s latest technology helps adapt blockchain technology to long-established regulatory and supervisory frameworks.Key focuses of Corda that that help build trust and mainstream viability, include:These are frameworks, as the Basel Institute attests to, that are necessary to combat illegal activity like money laundering and terrorist financing, among other elements and actions of malefactors.Corda’s blockchain architecture also allows for interoperability and flexibility so as not to restrict and constrict inclusion. Agnostic is the best avenue in the digital space.Further, R3 reports that the technology will include agreement at the “local” or individual level as well as offer validation between just parties involved in a transaction in contrast to a “broader pool of unregulated validators.”Kostinuk explains that the fact financial institutions are at the core of this development also stands to reason individuals could then exist and operate on a layer above, supported by the same fiscal framework the global economy currently beats to, just one more efficient and cost-effective.He says to Cointelegraph:“To anyone that believes a decentralized, peer-to-peer system could operate without regulation and oversight, consider the Panama Papers scandal. Even with rules and regulations, citizens — some of the wealthiest and supposedly legitimate businesspeople — circumvented the system for their personal gain. You can point to that and say the system as it is is not working, but one devoid of any ability to regulate and oversee sounds all the more alarming.”Financial systems need some form of control, regulation and oversight and blockchain technology allows us to do just that. Another question is whether that is the kind of blockchain we want.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Brandon Kostinuk  
Owner Moves Bitcoin Exchange Out of Estonia After Landmark Supreme Court Decision,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,4/15/2016 9:37,605,114,"BTC.ee owner alleges threats by Estonian police and moves business out of the country as Supreme Court of the country on Monday ruled against Bitcoin in a landmark case.BTC.ee recently announced closure over threats by the Estonian police. The website had an ominous notice posted on it about the closure stating, “Apparently the Estonian police can re-interpret the law, keep their interpretation secret, and apply it retroactively and arbitrarily. Unfortunately the courts in Estonia do not appear to see a problem with that.”Supreme Court rejected the claim by de Voogd that his activity could in no way be linked with Estonia as the portal was not located in Estonian servers. Also irrelevant in the opinion of the court was the fact that Bitcoin was created much later than Estonian laws treating the “alternative means of payment”.It all began in March 2014, when Dutch citizen resident in Estonia, Otto Albert de Voogd launched BTC.ee, a web based service that helped people buy and sell Bitcoin.However, over the course of time the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) became interested in the operations of de Voogd’s bitcoin exchange service and asked him several oral and written questions.FIU asked to be given information on BTC.ee customers: their bank account numbers and the destination of where the money was being sent.The Postimees Estonian News reports that Otto Albert decided to contest the FIU’s competence to supervise Bitcoin transactions. We asked Otto Albert de Voogd of BTC.ee about exactly what happened and he said:“Back in February 2014 I received a threatening e-mail from Estonian policeman Urmas Pai, that suggested they could start a criminal investigation against me. Subsequently he demanded that I provide them with information. I was not inclined to cooperate with an investigation against myself, so I declined to answer. I was told that if I did not answer I should file an appeal to the courts, which I did. The Supreme Court now ruled that I do not have the right to silence (similar to the US 5th amendment), because in their words, the risk of self-incrimination is either ""distant"" or ""theoretical"". I obviously disagree with that.”Otto is of the view that Estonia has violated EU Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws by unilaterally extending the EU AML law without giving a proper justification and registering the extension of the law with the EU.He argues that proper procedures were not followed in enforcement of the law. He also says that he is ‘irked’ by the fact that Estonian police did not reveal its interpretation of the law till they contacted him. Instead of making their position clear, he says, the police went on to look for people “to make an example off (sic)”.Ray Youssef, CEO at Paxful Inc, a company that operated from Estonia, doesn’t agree with de Voogd’s stand. “We don't have a crystal ball but this usually happens when businesses have a standoffish attitude towards the police, - says Youssef. - The police then take measures to enforce their right to police the situation, especially in such a small state like Estonia. We at Paxful left New York State for Estonian when the Bit License essentially out lawed a bitcoin startup's agility. We at Paxful have zero tolerance for anything that would stifle innovation and we can say with confidence that we feel safe operating in Estonia.”What effect the regulation of Bitcoin by Estonia will have on the cryptocurrency in Estonia is also a matter of perspective and interpretation, depending on who you ask.According to Otto de Voogd, restrictions imposed by Estonia mean that customers that trade more than 1,000 Euros worth of Bitcoins should be met literally face-to-face by representatives of exchanges and other parties involved.De Voogd adds that the Estonian government had been aware of issues surrounding Bitcoin for more than two years but has chosen to do nothing to change the situation.Estonia imposed Value Added Tax (VAT) on the entire value of a Bitcoin transaction. De Voogd is of the view that the country’s arguments in European Court of Justice (ECJ) for extension of this policy EU-wide is a huge setback for Bitcoin in the EU.However, the ECJ has ruled otherwise.There are obvious differences among individuals as well as companies when it comes to regulations and their utility. It is also a matter of debate as to who should regulate what.Europe is a unique case because there are national and supranational laws as well as regulators and decision making bodies.Interestingly, the Estonian Supreme Court decision can be seen as a landmark case because the court ruled that even if the servers were not located in their jurisdiction, the regulators have  sufficient grounds to intervene.  The operations of Otto’s business were located in Estonia, collected money in cash from Estonia and had been specifically created for an Estonian clientele.While preventing money laundering is an obvious concern of any state, overreach by the establishment is also a valid concern. However not everyone thinks that this is an extreme decision by the court.Ray Youssef says, “Within Estonia this will have little effect as this legislation was, by all indicators, passed to protect the police from legal liability in ending what they saw as a unworkable situation. Bitcoin itself was never the issue in this case. The spirit of this law and the details surrounding it will certainly be lost on EU officials and it may very well be used by other politicians within the EU as precedent to suppress bitcoin as a whole.”As for Otto de Voogd, we asked him if he would take this matter to the EU courts and he had this to say, “If I can, I will take it up with the European Court of Human Rights, I am also considering to file a complaint at the European Commission.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #BTC.ee    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Estonia    #AML    #EU  
"UK Regulators Declare Start of ""Beautiful Friendship"" With Bitcoin, Ethereum",Andrew Quentson,4/12/2016 18:00,1770,306,"Christopher Woolard, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Director of Strategy and Competition, announced a regulatory sandbox for fintech companies, a first of its kind. Harriett Baldwin, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, described Bitcoin and Ethereum as “digital currencies” and proclaimed the start of a “beautiful friendship”.Both have been speakers at Innovate Finance Global Summit in London. As Christopher Woolard said in a groundbreaking speech, the aim of the sandbox is to “test out their innovative ideas without immediately incurring all the normal regulatory consequences.”Companies and start-ups that participate in the sandbox will be issued individual guidance on how FCA will interpret the rules under the understanding that if the guidance is followed they are in full compliance. The FCA may further waive or modify the rules or, in rare cases, may issue a “no enforcement action”, in effect throwing out FCA’s rulebook during the sandbox stage. Normal laws in regards to civil and criminal liability, of course, still apply. In explaining, Woolard stated:“These letters aim to give firms comfort that as long as they deal with us openly, keep to the agreed testing parameters and treat customers fairly, we accept that unexpected issues may arise and will not take disciplinary action.”Signalling a highly innovative and open approach, Woolard stated that the sandbox will run “not dissimilar to how accelerators operate”, with two cohorts a year. Moreover, the FCA intends to go further, announcing an “industry working group to explore options for industry led sandboxes.”In a further speech at the same summit, Harriett Baldwin, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, indicated UK’s openness and welcoming of fintech innovation not only by announcing new measures, but also by the words she chose. Describing currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as “digital currencies”, Baldwin assured attendees that this was just the start of a “beautiful friendship”.Announcing an industry-led fintech panel, the addition of “digital experts” criteria to the Visa Scheme, an information hub to facilitate “practical and cost-effective” access to professional services and “fintech bridges” to help UK businesses expand internationally, building on a first of its kind agreement with the Australian counterpart to streamline regulatory access to each other’s market, Baldwin went further. “We will be announcing other ways we can help you help UK consumers.” - she stated.Thus, expect even more measures in what seems to be a complete embrace of fintech, including digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and not only a partnership, but a “beautiful friendship”.The United Kingdom is widely recognized as the most welcoming regulatory environment for Fintech companies.George Osborn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, signaled UK’s embrace of Bitcoin and Fintech in 2014 by buying a bitcoin through an ATM, making him the highest ranking government official in the world to have publicly used bitcoin.At the time, a number of measures were announced, including the incorporation of a PaymentSystems Regulator tasked with ensuring, among other things, access to banking facilities.The decision to not only embrace, but champion fintech, may turn out to be one of the most astute in a century.US Regulators have noticed and many are now loudly calling for an overhaul of the complex and outdated US regulations to account for 21stcentury innovations, including a scrapping of the draconian double taxation by IRS and the disastrous bitlicense.Beginning with CFTC’s commissioner who stated that blockchain tech could have prevented Lehman’s collapse, more and more have asked for a more welcoming regulatory environment, seemingly culminating in a whitepaper asking for recommendations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the independent department charged with overseeing banks and hailed by some as the appropriate body to usher in a new, more welcoming, regulatory approach towards Fintech.The United States however has a more complex regulatory environment with numerous regulatory bodies and overlapping responsibilities as well as different states with different requirements. It is not clear whether US regulators will be able to move quickly, considering that UK has just upped a gear, but, undoubtedly, the whole world is paying great attention to UK's numerousinnovative measures and their championing of Fintech.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Ethereum News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #United Kingdom    #USA  
Coinkite Is Closing Down Its Web Wallet Citing Legal and DDoS Issues,Charlie McCombie,4/3/2016 12:29,376,44,"Coinkite, the popular wallet and hardware payment network service provider, has announced it is closing down its web wallet to focus on other projects after legal issues and DDoS attacks have impeded the use of the wallet.After a noticeable lack in posting on their blog after incredibly frequent posting over the last three years, Coinkite has announced it is shutting down its web wallet service. Users of the service need not worry about the hardware aspect of Coinkite, as that will remain unaffected, and the team in fact hopes to expand it.“We are winding down the web wallet part of Coinkite so that our team can focus on a number of new products that are more decentralized and embodied as hardware products. We’re still big Bitcoin fans, supporters and Hodlrs, and although Coinkite has been great adventure in the SaaS business, we want to spend more time where our heart is, hardware products, software-”not-as-a-service”, and other exciting new possibilities.”Coinkite cited the legal issues associated with being a centralized Bitcoin service, and hence the financial strain brought about by lawyers, and non-stop DDos-ing since launch for the closing down of the service.“Being a centralized bitcoin service does attract attention from state actors and other well funded pains in the butt, and as a matter of fact, we’ve been under DDoS since the first month we launched—over three years–yay. Plus we have put real fiat dollars into our lawyers’ pockets, to defend our customers from their own governments. This is not what we love to do, which is coding and delivering awesome services.”Part of the issue in the cryptocurrency industry is that many of those who are choosing to create businesses in this newly-fledged sector, are fundamentally programmers, and as such are ill-equipped to deal with the likes of lawyers and regulators.The simple solution to this problem is greater co-operation between the financial industry and the cryptocurrency industry. The financial sector has been around for far, far longer than the cryptocurrency industry. It has the infrastructure, processes, and people already in place to deal with a lot of the issues facing these programmers-turned-businessmen, and if more startups are to succeed, they are going to need to implement them.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Coinkite    #DDoD    #Bitcoin Wallet    #Hardware  
Bitcoin + Canada = Match Made In Heaven,Iyke Aru,3/12/2016 12:33,413,20,"With a Bitcoin exchange index of over 600BTC per day, the highest adoption rate of BTMs, and a population with a very high tendency for adopting new technologies, Bitcoin has great prospects in Canada.Bitcoin awareness has been on the rise across the globe, but statistics show an exceptional performance in the growth of Bitcoin in Canada, says Moe Adham, co-Founder of BitAccess.The existence of building infrastructure for the Bitcoin company, Blockstream, in Montreal reveals how tolerant the government has been towards the cryptocurrency.Giving examples of Bitcoin companies that are resident in Canada, Moe Adham says:“There is Blockstream, which is building infrastructure and employs a large number of bitcoin core developers. They are based in Montreal. There is also CoinKite, which offers a privacy-focused bitcoin wallet and developer API. They are based in Toronto.”Adham identified the only major challenge experienced by Bitcoin as the unclear nature of regulation at the moment. This, he says, makes it difficult for smaller firms to establish banking relationships.“Nevertheless, there are roughly 30 of our BTMs in operation all across Canada. Adding 6,000 new locations is just part of our goal to make access to bitcoin easier for everyone in Canada,” says Adham.According to Adham, there exists an almost collaborative relationship between Bitcoin exchanges in Canada. He says that exchanges use other exchanges for liquidity and wallets partner up, emphasizing that the Canadian Bitcoin market is huge and the existing rivalry between exchanges is more of a competition.Looking into the future, he says:“We see a very bright future.

Russian Ministry of Finance Proposes 7 Years in Prison for Cryptocurrency Use,James Smith Jr,3/11/2016 15:20,317,68,"Thursday the Russian Ministry of Finance proposed to punish citizens that use so-called “money surrogates” with up to 7 years in prison. Russian authorities consider Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as such “surrogates”.  The exact text of these planned changes in the Russian Criminal Code has not yet been revealed, however according to the Russian News Agency Interfax, it is expected that the corrections will be aimed at those who seek to distribute, purchase in the interest of selling, or sell “monetary surrogates”.The Ministry of Finance plans to punish citizens with an up to 500,000 Rubles fine or a prison sentence of up to 4 years. For those involved in organized groups, the punishments are raised to a fine of 500,000-1 Mln Rubles or a prison sentence of up to 6 years.For high-level managers of financial organizations, the Ministry wishes to impose even harsher measures for the same crimes: a fine measuring between 1-2.5 Mln Rubles, or a prison sentence of up to 7 years.In the release it was stated that, although it is forbidden in Russia to release monetary surrogates and other cryptocurrencies, in no legal documents is it clarified what constitutes a 'monetary surrogate' nor are there outlines for punishments relating to such crimes.""The possibilities offered by anonymity and freedom from control by national organs of governement brings to monetary surrogates a shady economic turn-around. Thanks to the anonymity of wallet-owners, these monetary surrogates have gained a large degree of popularity in the purchase of illegal materials and laundering of illegal funds.”“Besides this, as a result of this competition aimed at legally valid currencies the state's sovereignty (in the form of monetary monopoly) in the form of monetary emission is damaged and it's capabilities of raising money from it's seigniorage"": added the Ministry in a statement.The Ministry of Finance first attempted to introduce legislation targeted at 'monetary surrogates' and Bitcoin in 2014, but at the time the project was heavily critized by the Ministry of Economic Development.In September 2015, it was revealed that the Ministry of Finance had concluded work on the proposed legislation. The department wished to punish transgressors with either a fine of up to 500,000 Rubles or a prison sentence fo up to 2 years.In February 2016, the Assistant Minister of Finance Alexei Moiseyev said that the department ""wishes to limit and punish only for the exchange of cryptocurrencies to Rubles"", as an analogue to other laws connected with illegal currency operations.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies  
Time To Be Very Careful With Blockchain,Iyke Aru,3/11/2016 9:00,405,179,"The Blockchain must be handled with the utmost care. Financial market expert, Stephen Corliss speaks with Cointelegraph on this and other subjects.The financial sector has inflicted endless pain on itself and society, speaks out Corliss:“This was a result of a long history of bad actors, flawed business practices, excessive leverage and a shield of secrecy that has resulted in a longstanding lack of trust by their very customers, the general public.Casual observers of history often conclude that the industry must be riddled with greedy, inept and dishonest professionals whose excessive appetite for yield and large compensation packages outweighs the needs of society.As a self-proclaimed student of the financial industry who has spent more than half his life working within this industry and studying the history and current rules of the global financial system.I can tell you that both the industry at large and the regulatory bodies that oversee them consist of many talented individuals and institutions of very high character who care about society.""Its failures, however, have been quite devastating and, in most cases, the result of those who targeted the vulnerable or ill-informed, whether it be Charles Ponzi in the 1920’s or more recently Bernie Madoff.These scandals have certainly played a role in tainting the industry’s image but it’s the more systemic problems, such as the 2008 GFC, that have hurt the industry the most as they often result in global contagion, affecting all levels of society.It is these problems that worry me most as they are unintentional and typically the result of shortsightedness, inadequate controls, poor management oversight, failed policies or a simple lack of in-depth knowledge of products, processes and the rules that govern them.In a less complex environment, I believe Blockchain ledger and smart contract technologies provide the global financial industry with its first legitimate opportunity to transform itself into an industry with a much healthier ecosystem able to overcome the aforementioned issues to regain the trust of society.In this perfect world, Blockchain technology would allow the industry to replace certain of its outdated multi-layered technology infrastructures, associated processes and business models.In this simple environment, the industry would be able to perform almost anything on an open ledger with smart contracts including customer onboarding, establishing customer agreements, providing risk, fee and conflict-of-interest disclosures, finalize and agree contractual terms on anything from securities transactions to mortgage loans to insurance contracts.To even forming and transacting loan and underwriting syndications amongst institutions, operating securities finance facilities such as securities lending and repurchase agreements or even operating entire limited partnerships and master trusts on semi-private ledgers.Moreover, although unfamiliar by the broader public, a rather significant use for the industry also involves vast reporting that occurs after the fact where most global financial institutions today are mandated, by jurisdictional rules or laws, to report certain financial transactions to local regulators.This reporting often involves anything from stock and bond orders and trades (or trade and transaction reports), customer securities account free credit and margin balances or Client Asset Reports, CMAR’s, Call Reports, CTR’s (currency transaction reports), large trader reporting, Electronic Blue Sheets and so much more.If the financial industry developed Blockchain technology in such a way that it created ledgers that were accessible or visible by regulators and/or outside service providers, much of these additional very burdensome reporting processes and associated costs would be eliminated, or at a minimum significantly reduced, whilst allowing regulators to monitor markets and firms in real-time more transparently to reduce risk and market manipulation.Such a world would allow us to digitize almost anything from securities issuance and exchanges to payment and settlement systems, which would finally allow markets to achieve real-time settlement across the globe resulting in a system of much less risk.Although the financial industry could do almost anything with the technology, recognizing these benefits will take quite some time because of innumerable enterprise and capital market structural constraints and barriers that exist involving anything from global competition to legal risks associated with intellectual property, privacy rights, trade secrets to regulations and rules of law.However, with competitive pressures mounting, existing industry firms appear to be rushing to get out in front of this disruptive technology while Venture Capital firms invest large sums of capital in new entrants. This is actually what keeps me up at night nowadays as I can tell you from experience that there are only a very small handful of financial practitioners in the world who have the depth and breadth of knowledge of the global financial landscape that this work requires.Without their insight, I’m quite afraid that the financial industry (both new and existing firms) will repeat their mistakes from the past leading to major systemic problems or further exposure of consumers who can ill-afford it.In fact, this is partly what has prompted me to develop Impact Catalyst, which is a Social Curator for entrepreneurs, and dFused which will deliver Social Markets using blockchain and smart contracts.   I would say to those desiring a new financial system that serves society, as I do, that if we are to recognize this new reality we must first understand how capital markets work at the core within each market and across all products, before attempting to design a new model.If we do not move carefully, we run the risk of hurting society and missing a real opportunity to develop a healthier financial model accessible to everyone no matter one’s financial wealth.",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Stephen Corliss    #Banks  
New Regulations in Japan Recognise Bitcoin as a Legal Form of Payment,Charlie McCombie,3/8/2016 16:24,1184,989,"Last month, on February 26th, Cointelegraph wrote an article about the legislative revisions that were to be presented by the Financial Services Agency of Japan, which sought to see Bitcoin and other virtual currencies recognised as a legitimate currencies. It was deemed that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies did indeed fulfil the nation’s definition of the functions of a currency, and therefore, should be recognised as such.As was discussed in Cointelegraph’s previous article, the main reason for this move to legitimization is to “ensure tighter oversight from the [Financial Services Agency of Japan] over the virtual economy.” The agency’s revisions proposed that “all institutions that deal in the business of virtual currencies, i.e. all exchanges and bitcoin businesses, would need to register with the Financial Services Agency.”Heavy regulation has evidently been greatly pushed for in the Japanese cabinet, as it has arisen that cryptocurrency exchanges will be placed under the supervision of the agency, and as part of this supervision, they would be required to be audited by certified public accountants, and would need to have a minimum capital of 10 million yen, or 88,066.60 USD, a substantial sum. Annual financial reports will be made mandatory, along with segregation of company and customer assets, with the aim of forcing exchanges with poor finances to be exposed. Lastly, with the goal of protecting customers, full disclosure of fees and contracts with users will be mandatory.Previous to these revisions, exchanges were not required to have dedicated permissible investment reserves for use in case of bankruptcy, and external audits and the segregation of exchange asses and customers assets was not commonplace.The hope is that these measures will help to prevent money laundering, while still ensuring the protection of the interests and security of Japan’s cryptocurrency users.Many have asked the question of whether this new legislation will allow Japanese citizens to pay their taxes in Bitcoin, but regrettably, this will not be the case. As Reddit user, /u/ismith23 put it:“The change is not a particular recognition of Bitcoin as a currency. The new definition would consider anything that can be exchanged for goods and services or legal tender as a currency. The changes mean bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, can be more tightly regulated and taxed. Taxes are assessed in Yen so they are paid in Yen. No change there.”Whether consumption tax should be imposed on Bitcoin transactions has also been debated in the Japanese cabinet. At a lower house budget committee meeting in February, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Tsukasa Akimoto, asked Finance Minister, Taro AsoAso, “Can’t you consider not imposing consumption tax on bitcoins in line with the international trend?”, to which AsoAso responded by pointing out that Japan is not the only country intending to tax Bitcoin, with other countries, like Australia, also taxing virtual currencies.Lastly, the issue of the high amount of capital required to operate as a cryptocurrency exchange have troubled some of those interested in cryptocurrency innovation in Japan.

"With President Bernie Sanders, Bitcoin Will Thrive",Neer Varshney,2/27/2016 18:11,828,244,"Socialist governments like to keep control of the entire economy in their hands by controlling the means of production, but Bernie doesn’t simply call himself a socialist, he is a self-proclaimed “democratic socialist”. When compared to his socialist peers from other countries, Bernie seems very center-left.As per Sanders, democratic socialism is not tied to any Marxist belief or the abolition of capitalism. Speaking at Georgetown University, he said:“I don’t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal”Sanders says he wants to implement modest socialist reforms like free tuition at public universities, campaign finance reform, and single-payer healthcare.Patrick Dugan from Omni Foundation spoke to Cointelegraph about how this will be good for Bitcoin:“Bernie's plans, more directly than others, will require the monetization of more US debt in order to monetize the Quantitative Easing (QE) for the people in the form of expensive subsidies for healthcare and education. So as the centrist, Wall St. friendly QE would cause that new money to flow into Wall St. assets, the Main St. QE would flow into business revenue as people necessarily spend it, and those who don't need to spend it, will be able to try and protect the value by buying physical gold, hoarding cash (expecting negative rates to follow), or if they want the full range of financial services that banking provided with the sovereignty of fungible hard money, they will get their money on an open blockchain such as Bitcoin.”Bitcoin’s value always rises dramatically when large economies are in turmoil and national fiat currencies inflate. People are more drawn towards alternative currencies when governments implement strict capital controls to regain financial stability.On January 29th 2016,  Ashton Kutcher, the famed actor who has also invested in BitPay, made this tweet that became very popular:Why do I get the feeling that the best hedge against a Sanders or Trump nomination may be buying bitcoin?Both Sanders and Trump are from the extreme ends of the left and right political spectrum. While Trump wants to ban Muslims and immigrants, Sanders is calling for a ‘political revolution’ against the ‘billionaire class’ that is controlling an overwhelming majority of the wealth.It is difficult to say at this point whether Bernie Sanders’ election to presidency will have any implications on Bitcoin whatsoever, especially since he hasn’t made his views on Bitcoin public, and politicians don’t always implement/succeed in implementing what they promised before election.Tone Vays, the head of research at BraveNewCoin, believes that a President Sanders would be phenomenal for Bitcoin. He noted:""Bernie Sanders becoming the next US President will be amazing for Bitcoin. Many feel that with his attempts to legalize drugs that Bitcoin may use a lot of utility. However, with his borderline communist views on taxes, Bitcoin will thrive as a way of protecting your money from the extortionists and should become the conduit to transferring wealth cross borders. Once this realization is made by those with value to protect, I expect the Bitcoin price to leave the 2013 high in the dust. I am actually considering going against everything I believe and voting for Sanders just for this very reason and then look to live somewhere in Asia where they actually understand capitalism.""What if Bernie tries to strictly regulate Bitcoin? Tone Vays welcomes the challenge:""If there is an attempt by the incoming administration of Sanders, Trump, or Hilary, I welcome the challenge. The Bitcoin ecosystem should only get stronger and more valuable with every failed attempt to regulate it by Government in a similar way to how they are fighting the Drug War. Otherwise, I would consider Satoshi's Blockchain experiment a failure.""Patrick Dugan said:“Any attempt to ban crypto, if coupled with an oppressive environment of either negative rates and incremental cash bans or more classically negative real rates due to inflation will just put a premium on hard money.”",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Bernie Sanders    #US Government    #Patrick Dugan    #Tone Vays  
Japan May Recognize Bitcoin as Legitimate Currency,Charlie McCombie,2/26/2016 9:15,326,180,"Financial regulators in Japan proposed the recognition of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as legitimate methods of payment on par with fiat money.On the 23rd of February the Financial Services Agency of Japan submitted legislative revisions that would see Bitcoin and other virtual currencies recognised as legitimate currencies.This has come about as a result of realizing that virtual currencies essentially fulfil the nation’s definition of the functions of a currency.Currently, virtual currencies are recognised as ‘objects’, as such they do not have the same status and are not treated the same as fiat currencies. It also means that they are not subject to any regulation by the Japanese authorities or otherwise.The submission date for these changes has been set as the current ordinary ‘Diet’ session. The hope is that these changes will be passed before the current term ends. However, the predicted result of the decision is mostly unknown.If the new proposed definition passes, virtual currencies must serve as a medium of exchange, i.e. they can be used for the purchase of goods and services. Those who choose to do so must also be able to exchange the virtual currencies for legal tender through purchases or trades with an unspecified partner.All institutions that deal in the business of virtual currencies, i.e. all exchanges and bitcoin businesses, would need to register with the Financial Services Agency to ensure tighter oversight from the agency over the virtual economy.Mostly this has come about as a result of the 2014 collapse of the world’s largest bitcoin exchange at the time, Mt.Gox, as it greatly exposed the lack of consumer protection in the industry and highlighted other issues consumers had been having with missing funds despite deposits.The hope is that these steps will create a legal framework upon which virtual currencies will be able to spread more quickly and safely, that there will be strengthened consumer protection, and spurred growth in the virtual economy and the financial technology sector.Tomonori Kanda, a financial affairs official at the governing Liberal Democratic party, said:“There is a long way to go...But we have discussed reform and believe it is the right way to go.”Another Financial Services Agency official in Tokyo echoed Mr Kanda’s statement, but chose to remain anonymous on account of the sensitive nature of the subject:“We have not decided anything yet...The way things work here is that any change would have to be approved by parliament first, and then we would work on writing the legislation.”Oleg Khovayko, lead developer at Emercoin, spoke to Cointelegraph and offered his opinion on the proposed legislation:“Any way of legitimization is good, since it will make definitions and transparent rules for crypto-related business.”However, he also added that he feels that it is not important whether cryptocurrencies are treated as currencies, as is proposed in Japan, or as commodities, as is the case in the US. He feels that it is more important that governments show the correct manner in which cryptocurrencies should be treated, thereby allowing for correct accounting of these assets.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Cryptocurrencies    #Fiat Money  
European Council’s Bitcoin Regulation: Blessing or Curse?,Iyke Aru,2/21/2016 11:26,343,91,"The regulation of virtual currencies by the European Council creates unduly burden on exchanges, but at the same time adds legitimacy to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, says a European Parliament consultant on the matter.Cointelegraph asked Jonathan Chester, who is the head of Bitwage, a leading payroll company in Europe and a contributor at Forbes, what he thinks about the process and how regulation will affect the Bitcoin ecosystem. He is a part of a working group that is consulting the European Parliament on the subject of virtual currency and blockchain.In Jonathan’s opinion, the overall concept is a good thing, however, the way regulation is implemented may be a bad thing.He said that the main positive for regulation is the legitimacy that comes with it. According to him, for current users of Bitcoin, many people feel that regulation is not necessary, as it creates unduly burdens both on the exchanges they like to use and the users themselves as the exchanges will have to pass those burdens on in the form of heavier Know Your Customer checks and increased costs.However, he also stated that the legitimacy is needed to create trust on a mainstream level, with mainstream level represented by everyday users, people who are unbanked, enterprises interested in leveraging the technology, and even the banks themselves.He further described how his company has spoken with many enterprises on the subject of who would be interested in using technology like Bitwage’s, stating that trust is always a concern. “Are you doing your KYC properly?  What partners are you working with?  Will the government come after us for working with you?”According to Jonathan:“By being regulated, you create a level of trust that breaks down those barriers, as the companies know that  you have the approval of the government. This approval is also important for users who may not know so much about the technology we use, aka Bitcoin & blockchain, and need to rely on third parties to know that companies are not ponzi schemes.”On the demerits of regulation, Jonathan’s opinion is that the down side is if regulation is too harsh, like in a situation where there is too much regulation, users will move to underground exchanges, dark markets, and decentralized exchanges to avoid the costs that have been passed on to them through regulated entities. This will result in these unregulated markets flourishing while entities attempting to follow the rules will wither away, which would likely have the opposite affect of what is wanted, which is less money laundering and more consumer protection. He mentioned an example of regulation that goes too far as what can be seen in Estonia. Saying that currently, there is a decision being made as to whether facilitation, mediation, buying or selling of bitcoins on behalf of another is considered an alternative means of payment and warrants getting a local license. Lawyers say that as part of this license, it is required for institutions to perform Know Your Customer due diligence when users sign up for the first time in person.  So if a company has French, German and Estonian customers sign up, they need to meet face to face with a company representative. Jonathan believes that such a scenario is obviously going way too far, as not only would almost all Bitcoin companies be unable to fulfill such a requirement, but more traditional companies like Paypal as well.Mr. Chester pointed out that Europe is currently looking at two different types of revisions. One with the AMLD4 which is already live, so the revision would likely have to be made in the AMLD5, although he thinks that there may be a process by which it would be possible to make a small revision in the AMLD4 without having to call it a new AMLD. Saying that the revision would be a light touch which would be similar to what FinCEN has said in the US, which essentially states that certain types of virtual currency companies need to perform KYC and report suspicious activity, which is already being done by most exchanges in anticipation of this change.On another note, Jonathan said that the revision of the payment services directive is an entirely different beast altogether. First of all, the second payment services directive (PSD) is about to go live, so any changes can still be put into the second PSD. Secondly, the PSD is the article that requires licensing, so any edits in this case will be claiming that certain types of companies need certain licenses. According to him:“In the PSD 1, there are three main licenses that, at least, are relevant to how Bitwage would interact with it. There is a banking license, an e-money license and a payment institution license. In the PSD2, there will also be a Third Party Payment Processor license. The question is, if they decide to amend the PSD2 to include virtual currency, which licenses will companies be required to get or will there be even another license that will be included. These decisions may have a very big effect on newer companies that are trying to innovate in the space, but may not have necessarily raised enough money to be licensed in the way that is recommended.Luckily, the European Parliament is very open to learning from the community.  Bitwage is part of a working group that is educating the European Parliament right now on the subject of virtual currency and blockchain, so that if there is regulation, that the regulation can be done well. We met in February with members of the parliament and will likely be meeting in March again.”",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Europe    #KYC    #Jonathan Chester  
Terrorists not Using Bitcoin? Politicians Want to Regulate It Anyway,Martin Rojko,2/5/2016 11:07,756,114,"The European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol, has stated, in its recently published report, that the use of Bitcoin in financing terrorist activities has not been confirmed.""Despite third party reporting suggesting the use of anonymous currencies like Bitcoin by terrorists, there is no evidence however of IS-financing networks in existence.""Despite the clear conclusion reached in this report, another EU bureaucracy arm, the European Commision, has only just come out with a comprehensive package to tackle ""terrorist financing"". It seems this proposal is more about tightening capital controls than ""fighting terrorism,"" as digital currency economy accounts for only a tiny fraction of global money transfers.""To prevent their abuse for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, the Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive, so that these platforms have to apply customer due diligence controls when exchanging virtual for real currencies, ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges,"" the EC press release states.The reality is that these exchanges have been implementing KYC/AML requirements for some time, so this provision doesn't come as a surprise. Apparently, European regulators do not intend to stop here and want to proceed further in their plans to get cryptocurrencies under their control. According to information from EDCAB, published on their blog, the EC is preparing the Payment Services Directive under which exchanges and wallet providers must apply for licensing and supervision.However, as has been mentioned many times before, Bitcoin is not an anonymous means of transfer, only pseudonymous as all transactions are public. Thus the use of Bitcoin by criminals is in reality riskier than traditional methods, such as cash-in-hand transfers. Jeremy Millar, of Magister Advisors, believes that the Bitcoin blockchain is now much more closely monitored for illicit transactions than even the banking system.""More interesting has been the birth of software products that apply machine learning to inspect the Bitcoin blockchain for suspicious activity and monitoring the dark web for illicit transactions. This is far beyond the capabilities of banks today to monitor cash deposits,"" he said, at the recent EP hearing on virtual currencies.""It is not easy to connect Bitcoin transactions to a particular user, but it is possible to connect a transaction to a specific service or group of services, thereby linking it to for example a regulated exchange or dark market activities,"" Michael Gronager, CEO of Chainanalysis, explains to Cointelegraph. He denies finding any blockchain transactions which could be related to terrorism. ""To terrorism no, but several to other criminal activities like stolen Bitcoins from compromised exchanges, dark markets, or extortion schemes.""""It is easier to monitor digital cash than paper cash for possible criminal activity or the proceeds thereof. However, if the question is if blockchain [sic] is being more closely monitored than banking system [sic], to that I would say only partially. Monitoring and reporting only happens in some jurisdictions,” M. Gronager concludes.""The perception that cryptocurrencies are anonymous is largely myth. The corollary that cryptocurrencies are mainly used to launder money is grossly-overstated and unsubstantiated. The ability to trace past transactions render virtual currencies highly unsuitable for money laundering,” said Siân Jones, founder of EDCAB - the European Digital Currency & Blockchain Technology, at the recent European Parliament Committee hearing on virtual currencies.As she pointed out, the best estimates of global money laundering, according to UNODC and the Financial Action Task Force, are around $1.6 trillion, or 2.7 per cent of global GDP, in 2009. The total dollar value of cryptocurrencies is around $7 billion. “Detailed analysis of bitcoin blockchain - made possible by its inherent transparency allows us to deduce that virtual currencies account for something considerably less than 100,000th of 1% of global money laundering.”“According to a recent Europol report, €500 notes account for 30% of the €1 trillion banknotes in circulation, despite not being a common means of payment. It would not take much to conclude that the Euro is at least 92 times more likely to be used in money laundering than virtual currencies.”",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Terrorism    #Money Laundering    #EDCAB  
Meet the New Hampshire Legislators Pushing for Bitcoin Adoption,Joël Valenzuela,1/27/2016 15:40,450,142,"On January 20th, the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted 264-74 to defeat HB552, a bill that would have allowed the state government to accept payment of taxes and fees in Bitcoin. In 2015, the bill was tabled to be voted on at a later date so it could be further studied.Cointelegraph spoke to four of the legislators supporting the measure (and who have been active in pushing for pro-Bitcoin legislation over the years), three of whom served as co-sponsors: Representative Eric Schleien (the bill’s primary sponsor), Representative Keith Ammon, Representative James Spillane, and former Representative George Lambert.Rep. Schleien and Rep. Spillane (who accepted Bitcoin donations for his election campaign) first read about Bitcoin online somewhere they couldn’t recall. George Lambert, who is now an avid Bitcoin user, first heard about it at the Porcupine Freedom Festival, an annual festival held in New Hampshire by the Free State Project.“I sold webhosting for Bitcoin when BTC was around $3. So I was getting 5 BTC/ month.”Rep. Ammon, also an avid user who has been buying Bitcoin since the only way to do so was through an Internet Relay Chat (before the launch of any of the early exchanges), heard about Bitcoin at another Free State Project-sponsored event, the annual Liberty Forum conference, initially through a side discussion about RipplePay, the precursor to the modern Ripple network.“Back then, RipplePay was a centralized network that basically kept track of IOUs between people. I didn’t get it. Couldn’t understand it. It just seemed too easy to scam the system. So I kept up with some of the other participants in the room, continuing the discussion as we saw each other later at various gatherings. [Mathematics professor and early Bitcoin adopter] Darren Tapp was one of the participants and eventually he heard about Bitcoin and introduced me to it in one of our discussions. I did some investigation into it, and the light went off. It made total sense, and I’ve been a Bitcoin enthusiast ever since.”Rep. Schleien created HB552 to allow the state of NH to accept payment of taxes and fees in bitcoin through the use of a third party payment processor, calling it:“...simply a more secure and cheaper alternative for taxpayers than using a credit card and wouldn't cost the state any money. The state isn't allowed to work with a company that would cost them money because I created that constraint in the bill.”Rep. Spillane, in addition to co-sponsoring the legislation, also helped organize the debate before the vote. Lambert, in addition to proposing multiple Bitcoin-related bills during his term as State Representative, has testified in favor of similar legislation after leaving office, including HB552. Rep. Ammon co-sponsored the bill and testified to the committee on its merits, but admits he “didn’t do too much heavy lifting trying to get it to pass.”“It was mostly a symbolic bill. I didn’t anticipate too many people paying the state in bitcoin. But it would have sent a message to entrepreneurs in other parts of the country that New Hampshire was a technologically progressive state.”Lambert estimates only 40-60 of the 400 members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives understand Bitcoin. Rep. Spillane gave a similar estimate of 75, though he suggested that, after the testimony surrounding HB552, around 60% (or 240 members) would at least recognize the term. Rep. Ammon concurred, but added:“...many still think it’s magic Internet money and don’t understand the concepts behind it. It was kind of funny watching some of the older representatives trying to wrap their heads around it. Humans definitely have a universal facial expression for when they’re confused.”Rep. Spillane considers the inability of many legislators to understand Bitcoin to be a significant barrier to adoption.“We still can't accept credit cards in the secretary of state business office for crying out loud.”Rep. Schleien concurred that ignorance about the working of Bitcoin constitutes a barrier, as well as fear.“Psychology is often run by the fear of failure. There's also the fear of not understanding how this works. Education around this issue is key.”Lambert had a slightly different take on why Bitcoin adoption by the New Hampshire legislature had faced challenges, saying that they key was“...understanding [that government] does not know how to protect public rather than they shouldn't protect the public”Rep. Ammon took the non-governmental attitude in regards to Bitcoin even further, saying that he doesn’t know that the path to legitimacy goes through legislation.“In reality, Bitcoin and blockchain tech have the potential to make governments obsolete. I believe, governments, once they figure out what a powerful invention it is, will become more hostile to Bitcoin over time.”Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives Rep. Ammon hope for its continued adoption with or without government blessing because of how difficult it is to “put the genie back in the box.”“Another [saving grace] is that most legislators are far from technologically savvy, so they’re usually playing catch up when it comes to regulating technology. My hope is that crypto anarchists continue to stay one step ahead of stifling legislation and that this breakthrough new technology has the chance to grow to its full potential.”",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #New Hampshire    #USA    #Government    #Eric Schleien    #James Spillane    #George Lambert    #Keith Ammon  
European Union Wants to Surveil not Regulate Bitcoin,Neer Varshney,1/26/2016 14:30,299,78,"The European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) held a public hearing on Monday, January 25th 2016 on virtual currencies and the role of regulators.The role of virtual currencies in abetting illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorism funding was the central idea discussed during the meeting.  The ECON policy-makers took a balanced and careful consideration of the impact of virtual currencies and crypto-technologies, taking into account both the advantages and underlying risks of using the technology.Sean Ennis, Senior Economist at OECD spoke in favor of virtual currencies. He said that while many governments may have ruled virtual currencies out because of their possible use in illegal activities, virtual currencies are more secure in many ways than paper value; the negatives of virtual currencies being much weaker than the use of cash.He also added that the EU could learn lessons from how Britain has maintained lower regulatory requirements for peer-to-peer lending, enabling the fledgling sector to innovate and grow much faster than in the rest of Europe.Sian Jones, founder of EDCAB said:“Blockchain delivers trust in an otherwise trustless realm. It is the ability to provide an incontrovertible single source of truth that cannot be altered or corrupted.The potential of this trust mechanism has not been missed by the public sector or private sector.”She also added Cryptography offers a lot of transparency and as opposed to popular beliefs it is not anonymous but pseudo-anonymous, only having the appearance of being anonymous.One of the policymakers at the hearing said: “As regulators, European Union is watching carefully whether there is a need to closely regulate Bitcoin and whether it can be used to fund terrorism or money laundering. After the Paris-attacks in last november, we want to ensure that virtual currencies are not used to fund terrorism.”Olivier Salles, a senior financial officer at European Commission of the EU said that there are risks associated with virtual currencies like price volatility, platform stability, and cyber risks like theft and hacking, and added that he was in favor of monitoring these developments instead of proposing new rules.Jeremy Miller from Magister Advisors said on the regulation of Blockchain technology:""They are putting in regulatory capital, they are already registered with the regulators, by and large. If the companies and the activities are already regulated, I don't know what it means to regulate the technology"".The public hearing was a part of the process of preparing a report of the ECON committee. It remains to be seen what recommendations will the final report propose, if any.Cointelegraph talked to Sian Jones of EDCAB, who was one of the speakers at the public hearing for comments. She had also talked to us earlier, telling us about what to expect from this hearing.She said:  “Interestingly, there were no regulators at yesterday's hearing. The policy-makers on the panel and the legislators on the parliamentary committee seemed, largely, not to want to rush into legislative action and risk stifling innovation. However, the hearing is just the start of a process and we shall have to wait a few months to see what recommendations, if any, are made in the report. Of course, EDCAB will be continuing dialogue with all political groups and interested MEPs during the committee’s deliberations.”When asked what to expect from the final report of the hearing, she added “Experience of EU institutions has taught me not to predict the outcome of reports. I think amendments to European anti-money regulations are likely. Harder to predict are systemic and consumer protection responses. The possibility of preventive measures is still a possibility. I do expect some recommendations in the final report.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #EU    #Europe    #ECON    #Sian Jones  
White and Black Market Businesses Talk Bitcoin,Joël Valenzuela,1/15/2016 8:10,405,0,"During its early adoption phase, Bitcoin was frequently associated with black market uses, most notoriously the Silk Road. Today, CoinMap.org lists over 7,000 businesses employing Bitcoin worldwide.Cointelegraph talked to several business owners, both legal and extralegal, about their use of Bitcoin.Dr. Darren Tapp, Ph.D., a mathematics professor who teaches mainly homeschooled children, started using bitcoin as a toy.“As I learned more about it, I started to realize that bitcoin or something like it will change the future.”He believes accepting Bitcoin helps him retain certain clients who pay with it exclusively.Matthew Ping, a property manager who manages several rental units in the Manchester, New Hampshire area, adopted Bitcoin to facilitate the rent payment process.“There was a market demand for it in Manchester and I’m intrigued by the technology.  As a property manager I received the request to accept bitcoin because some of my residents get paid in bitcoin. I want to make it easier and less expensive for my residents to pay rent on time.”And largely, this has helped Ping’s business, since he can receive on-time payments when residents are traveling anywhere in the world, without accruing an additional transaction cost or waiting for a check to arrive. However, he doesn’t see using Bitcoin as being without complications.“It is sometimes difficult because the mortgage lenders and vendors don’t accept bitcoin yet. The rent payments have to be converted by using a service like Bitpay or Coinbase which make the facilitation much easier but still somewhat of a hassle.”Ping seeks to operate in complete compliance with all local governmental regulations for the security of his business.“I operate my business above ground because I am a licensed Real Estate Broker.  I follow all rules and regulations set forth by the state and I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize my livelihood.”Dr. Tapp also operates above ground and reports income etc. to all applicable authorities, but admittedly faces less regulatory hurdles than Ping.“The whole point of my project is to provide services outside of a highly regulated industry. Since I do not offer any certification,  I am not a school, and I do not claim to be accredited there are no applicable regulations to comply with.”On the other side of the equation, Cointelegraph interviewed Bitcoin-using business owners who explicitly choose to avoid government compliance. Ron Helwig, creator and owner of Shire Silver, an alternative currency based on precious metals, chooses not to report any of his activities to regulators.“Well, I have no contact with government, if that's what you mean. No registration of the business, no taxes, no filings. The business isn't a corporation of any kind.”Amanda B. Johnson, co-founder of daily cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer network news show, has also not sought out compliance with any legal or governmental framework.“We try to only do things that are profitable, and I wouldn’t consider a government partnership to be profitable.”Johnson, who heavily relies on Bitcoin as it makes up roughly 90% of her business, sees it as immensely practical.“Sending and receiving payments is so fast and easy, and when they’re received they’re confirmed within 20 minutes, so it’s not days with a bank, it’s not I have to go to an ATM now, it’s not I have to go deposit a check now. It’s I sent my client an invoice 5 minutes ago, they paid me 4 minutes ago, and now the money is right here on my computer.”Helwig, who runs a lean operation and whose business does just-in-time manufacturing, nonetheless stopped using Bitpay specifically to avoid government involvement.“When I started accepting it I was using a website plugin to use Coinapult's services. I switched after a while to a Bitpay plugin. But recently Bitpay has caved in to KYC/AML requirements (even though they shouldn't apply in my case) and I am not able to give them the information they demanded, so I stopped using their plugin. For now I've been using manual and ad-hoc processes, although I am planning on implementing my own plugin which won't rely on third parties.”Bitcoin allows Helwig to operate outside of a legal structure more freely.“When using a third party such as Bitpay, there really isn't much difference as far as legal ramifications since they will be required to behave similarly to Paypal or other more traditional money services. But if you handle things yourself then yes bitcoin can be more convenient in that you don't need to worry about things you do getting reported without your consent or knowledge. And of course bitcoin's non-legal advantages make it even more attractive.”Are you interested in bitcoin? Find it in our cryptocurrencies ratings and learn more.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Markets    #Government  
Bitcoin Is Well Aligned With The Texan Culture,Iyke Aru,12/23/2015 11:09,453,0,"Texas has proven to be a frontline state within the Bitcoin and Blockchain ecosystem. Sam Castaneda speaks with Cointelegraph on the peculiar characteristics of the state and why they have led in breaking new grounds within the ecosystem and milestones that have been achieved by the people of Texas.Sam Castaneda is the Co-Founder of UTXO, a Bitcoin company based in Texas. Sam was born in south Texas and moved to Houston to pursue economics at the university of Houston. Sam proudly says:“I have been a Texan all my life.”According to Sam, Texas has always been inclined to take a stance in monetary policies. Giving an example with Greg Abbot ""texans governor"" who signed house bill 483 which had an interesting proposal for a state run bullion depository. The Texas Bullion Depository, in essence a gold backed bank. Such would be a first of its kind in the nation. The policy would allow individuals and entities to be able to purchase goods and use assets in the vault the same way you would be able to use cash. Sam emphasized that Texans are on the front line of  adapting new technology in the finance sector.“Texas banking commission was the first state to come out and address virtual currencies. Now Bitcoin’s popularity in Texas is growing but I have no doubt that Texan culture will be among the first to adapt to the bitcoin technologies.” He said.Sam did not hold back in making it known that there is still a lot of room for achievement. Despite insisting that Texas is one of the leading states in the development of the Bitcoin market, he believes that there is still a lot left to be achieved. To this he said:“As Bitcoin grows and becomes more of a household name more people are wanting to use it, as well as merchants seeing the value it creates within the scope of running a business.”One major aspect in the acceptance of Bitcoin as a currency in Texas is that fact that Bitcoin users do pay tax. According to Sam, there are a multitude of different scenarios that taxation comes into play, one of which is sales tax which falls under state regulation. In addition he notes that the comptroller has not come out to make any direct statement on sales tax and virtual currencies but different states have expressed different outlooks on the issue as well as countries having to recognize it. He also said that what interests him is that Bitcoin just came roaring into existence, forcing countries and states to define how it will be taxed. This is still being fought over through different agencies worldwide.Mr. Castaneda analysed the taxation of Bitcoin by saying:“As a person holding bitcoin, under IRS and Texas guidelines it is seen as property. The same procedures of property taxation will apply; so the important things are time and USD relative price to BTC. If you take a loss on your property you can record that, if you have a gain you report that as well. In no way is BTC not subject to tax.”He noted though that the laws may not be as concrete as the tax laws that have always been in existence.Sam didn’t end without saying that he and his company (UTXO) are confident that the Texas market is the best place to start a business in the revolutionary cryptocurrency industry, saying:“As a Co-founder of UTXO and a native of Texas I see the similarities within both cultures, Texan and bitcoin culture align in many aspects.”We hope that you liked this article.

Serica Shuts Its Hard Assets Blockchain Trading,Martin Rojko,12/18/2015 16:22,539,0,"Serica, formerly DigitalTangible, announces the December closure of its hard assets and blockchain trading business that linked precious metals and other hard assets to the Blockchain via a browser-based trading wallet.The company was one of the first to bridge the old world of precious hard assets to the new world of the Blockchain. It spent a year and a half building and developing the world's first and only commercial bitcoin2.0 digital asset trading wallet and now says goodbye to the markets and customers that launched the company in 2014.Their innovative technology gave trading customers full control of their private keys that authorized the movement of their physical assets, anywhere in the world. In addition to converting hard assets into blockchain tokens, Serica built a network of global custodians in Singapore, Switzerland, Argentina and the United States. Asset trading included mostly precious metals, but also stock certificates, stored commodities and farmland titles.Serica founder and CEO, Taariq Lewis, shares his thoughts on exiting the precious metals industry: “We were lucky to have the early adopters of new blockchain services come to us to make the impossible a reality: Hard assets secured by the blockchain with easy Peer-to-Peer trading. However, we are exiting this market to identify new opportunities in FinTech on which we can continue our company's growth. There are many others doing great work in this space and we think they will continue building where we have left off.”Taariq Lewis further explains the reasons for closure to Cointelegraph: “Our competitors have easier legal clearance and seem to have the budget to cover the compliance costs needed to serve this business. The compliance costs to our company were simply too great for a technology startup at our stage of growth. We are leaving mostly because we have other more profitable business to pursue leveraging our technology. We think there's still a substantial opportunity to serve markets where bitcoin can solve big business problems, such as health-care payments. P2P hard-asset trading is exciting, but not as a big business problem as we had hoped.”“I’m sure they had valid reasons to discontinue the service. They’ve run an exceptional business, and we learned a lot from them in our early stages,” says Alexi Lane, CEO and founder of Bangkok based fintech company Amilabs and its flagship project MidasRezerv. “High cost of compliance can be the issue, but since we don’t operate in the United States I don’t really know how expensive this can be. In general, starting and operating any fintech business in the US is already disadvantageous for startup companies due to necessary licensing and regulation costs.”Lane never considered Serica to be a direct competitor, as they used a different business model, without issuing their own coin and allowing users to trade their assets in the blockchain marketspace. Something like a Bitcoin based Ebay. “We use more B2C sales oriented model, where we issue own gold-backed coin that represents gold already stored and fully verified with 3rd party custodian.““I could only imagine what a regulatory nightmare it is to issue your own gold backed token,“ Joshua Scigala, co-founder of Vaultoro, comments for CT. This Bitcoin-Gold exchange does not back a token because that would make it a currency issuer. Its transparency protocols use the blockchain to provide proof of a 100% reserve but they do not offer a transferable token backed by gold. When a member buys gold on the Vaultoro market place they buy the physical gold that is secured in their name as their property. When someone needs to spend that gold they convert it into Bitcoin instantly and spend it that way. “By doing this we are effectively a shop and not a currency issuer, we leave that part up to bitcoin.”",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Serica    #Tradings    #Assets    #Taariq Lewis    #USA    #Vaultoro    #Joshua Scigala    #Alexi Lane    #DigitalTangible  
Kenyan Central Bank Warns that BTC is Unregulated. No Mention of Inflation,Martin Rojko,12/15/2015 16:18,377,0,"The Central Bank of Kenya has warned the public against Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, citing that it’s not legal tender and is unregulated. People should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products.There are not many countries left in the world with a buoyant Bitcoin market where the central bank hasn't issued a cautious statement on using cryptocurrency. Now Kenya joins the club of frightened central bankers. “Domestic and international money transfer services in Kenya are regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya Act and other legislation. In this regard, no entity is currently licensed to offer money remittance services and products in Kenya using virtual currencies such as Bitcoin,“ the bank said in it’s announcement.Of course the bank uses the same old rhetoric, saying “(there is) no protection when transacting, the possibility of abuse by criminals in money laundering, terrorism finance, no underlying asset or speculative nature of the value...“""These types of government-issued warnings are always amusing because they act as if their own monopoly legal tender is the paragon of safety and stability while simultaneously ignoring the actual, real consumer benefits of Bitcoin,"" Jon Matonis, former Executive Director of Bitcoin Foundation comments for CT.“As the most counterfeit-proof currency in existence today, Bitcoin protects consumers from the risk of accepting or receiving counterfeit bank notes in commerce, which continues to plague the world's fiat note issuers. Using Bitcoin because it doesn't come with government assurances is like not flying because you might fall out of the sky. Bitcoin, with its fixed and predictable supply, provides an alternative store of value to the currency of nations with printing presses run amok,“ adds J. Matonis.1 Bitcoin is currently worth 45 300 Kenyan Shillings (KES). It costed 32 770 KES/BTC a month ago and 24 400 KES/BTC three months ago.

Investors Developing Confidence in Bitcoin: Nigeria’s Apex Bank Plans Regulation,Iyke Aru,11/27/2015 7:57,259,0,"“Every investor settles in an area of superior confidence and that is the gap between the Nigerian investor and Cryptocurrencies”. This assertion was made to Cointelegraph in a telephone talk with seasoned investment banker Stephen Ekene Isiuwe, a Business Professional with Investment One Financial Services Limited, Abuja on Tuesday November 24th, 2015.Stephen Isiuwe is a Business Professional with Investment One Financial Services Limited, formerly known as GTB Asset Management Limited (GTBAM), the former investment and wealth management subsidiary of Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GTBank), one of Africa’s leading Banks.Having been in the industry for about two decades, Mr Isiuwe said that prior to this time the average Nigerian investor possessed a gullible approach to new investment opportunities and usually jumped at new options with unprecedented enthusiasm. This was true until about five years ago when the so called “wonder-banks” emerged with different brands of products that looked very promising, but when things eventually turned bad, there was no safety net to fall back to. That, in his opinion, is the reason for the relative reluctance in accepting bitcoin within the Nigerian population.Asked what in his opinion with the outlook of the local investor, he said that investors crave new opportunities so desperately like it has never been within the Nigerian investment sector. According to him, several factors have influenced the investors’ withdrawal syndrome from the Nigerian economic environment. He mentioned such factors as:Six months into the tenure of the present government, the economic development policies are yet to be made known. This leaves room for a lot of uncertainty and fear as revealed by the inaction of even foreign investors within the Nigerian economy. As reflected in the Africa’s Business Attractiveness Index Ranking by Rand Merchant Bank on October 4th 2015, where the Country dropped from 2nd to 5th position in just Six months.He stressed that the nation’s inability to conquer the Boko Haram terrorists so far leaves more to be desired within the minds of individuals and corporations who will want to put their resources into the economy.In his final analysis, Mr. Isiuwe insisted that the average Nigerian investor is searching for opportunities that are not directly dependent on the nation’s policies for now. Furthermore, investing in Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies remains one of such opportunities as long as a safety net of regulation can be put in place. This will safeguard against eventualities where institutions like the National Deposits Insurance Corporation (NDIC) could protect at least a portion of the investments when things go south.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Nigeria    #Investments  
"‘Go Beyond Headlines, Hype to Find Crypto Risks’ Urges Idaho Finance Chief",William Suberg,1/5/2018 22:40,59486,233,"Idaho lawmakers have told the public to “look beyond the headlines” so they can “understand the risks” posed by investing in cryptocurrency.In an official news release Thursday, the state’s Department of Finance (DATE) quoted director Gavin Lee saying investors should avoid “hype” when products or services involving cryptocurrency of any kind are involved.He warned:“Investors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptocurrency futures contracts and other financial products where these virtual currencies are linked in some way to the underlying investment.”In issuing the warning, Idaho joins the growing regulatory patchwork in effect across the US, with different states adopting fragmented attitudes towards virtual currency. Alaska also entered the fray this week, with Division of Banking and Securities director Kevin Anselm telling residents to exercise caution.“We’re seeing a number of people contacted by sellers of virtual currencies or sellers that want people to get in on initial coin offerings, including virtual currencies.”At the national level, traders are waiting with bated breath for what may be a breakout year for Bitcoin-related financial instruments in 2018.

Texas Regulator Orders Bitconnect to Cease and Desist Marketing ‘Securities’,David Dinkins,1/5/2018 3:30,69302,1019,"The Texas Securities Commissioner issued an Emergency Cease and Desist Order on Jan. 4 against Bitconnect for the selling of unlicensed securities. According to the Texas State Securities Board news release:“The Securities Commissioner found that the BitConnect investments are securities, but were not registered as required by the Texas Securities Act and State Securities Board Rules and Regulations. In addition, the company is not registered to sell securities in Texas.”Bitconnect markets itself as an open-source “crypto community platform” that offers multiple ways to invest and transact in its native cryptocurrency, BCC. According to the Order, Bitconnect offers users investments in “programs that the company claims will deliver annualized returns of 100% or more”.As the release clearly states, Bitconnect is based in England and this order does not affect the company directly. However, the regulator does have the authority to ban Bitconnect from dealing with Texas residents. Of course, it is likely to be quite challenging for the company to separate users of Bitconnect tokens in Texas from those in the rest of the world.While cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been largely focusing on regulation at the national level, Texas’ ruling shows that sub-national regulators can easily affect the regulatory landscape. This adds an extraordinary level of complexity to regulatory compliance. Cryptocurrency users and businesses may find themselves dealing with countless state and provincial regulators, in addition to national authorities, if other jurisdictions follow Texas’ lead.The Texas regulator harshly condemned Bitconnect, writing:“BitConnect has disclosed virtually nothing about its principals, financial condition, or strategies for earning profits for investors. It has not provided a physical address in England.“Despite providing no information on how it will make money for investors – including the algorithms behind the Trading Bot – BitConnect is touting its investments as a “safe way to earn a high rate of return.”“Investing in cryptocurrencies, however, carries significant risk because of regulatory and legal actions, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and the extreme volatility in the price of many cryptocurrencies.”The release continues, explaining in greater detail:“The company operates websites and deploys online advertising to recruit sales agents, which it calls “affiliates.” The company provides marketing material to affiliates, including online presentations, and pays them commissions for referrals that result in investments in BitConnect programs.Sales agents for BitConnect are targeting Texas residents, as well as residents of other states, through websites, social media, and online marketplaces like craigslist.The sales agents are not, however, registered as agents of BitConnect to sell securities in Texas.The Securities Commissioner’s action follows BitConnect’s recent announcement that it will hold an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in the U.S. on Jan. 9. Companies use coin offerings, also called token sales, to raise capital.”",64,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitconnect    #Texas    #SEC    #Security  
Egypt's Top Cleric Declares Bitcoin Trading 'Unlawful',David Dinkins,1/4/2018 3:15,80812,865,"Egypt’s highest official of religious law, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam, called Bitcoin trading “unlawful” under Sharia law, online publication Ahram reported today. In the fatwa issued Monday, Allam wrote that Bitcoin isn’t an “acceptable interface of exchange” and is therefore unlawful to trade. The cleric also cited Bitcoin’s potential for money laundering and pointed out that because it isn’t subject to any government’s control, Bitcoin could potentially undermine the Egyptian economy.Allam further stated that Bitcoin negatively affects “dealers’ legal safety” and that:""Bitcoin is forbidden in Sharia as it causes harm to individuals, groups and institutions.”One of the grand mufti’s advisors told BBC that Bitcoin is “used directly to fund terrorists.” Egypt’s government is also no fan of cryptocurrencies, having called Bitcoin a “form of deception that falls under legal liability.”Back in February 2017, Cointelegraph spoke to several experts about Bitcoin’s status under Sharia law. Matthew Martin of Blossom Finance explained his belief that Bitcoin is halal, writing:“As a payment network, Bitcoin is halal. In fact, Bitcoin goes beyond what more conventional closed banking networks offer. Unlike conventional bank networks which use private ledgers where there's no guarantee that the originator actually owns the underlying assets, Bitcoin guarantees with mathematical certainty that the originator of the transfer owns the underlying assets. Conventional banks operate using the principle of fractional reserve, which is prohibited in Islam.”Matthews did agree that Bitcoin isn’t likely to be considered money under Islamic law:““Historically, though, Islam has only recognized commodities of intrinsic value as money including things like gold (Dinar), silver (Dirham); rice, dates, wheat, barley and salt. In a strict interpretation of what qualifies as money, Bitcoin probably misses the mark.”",26,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Law    #Egypt    #Tradings    #Government    #BBC  
"India Falsely Condemns Bitcoin as Ponzi Scheme, Flawed Logic",Joseph Young,1/1/2018 14:03,38632,595,"Recently the Indian finance ministry criticized Bitcoin and the rest of the digital currencies in the market for their lack of intrinsic value.The Indian finance ministry stated:""There is a real and heightened risk of investment bubble of the type seen in Ponzi schemes which can result in sudden and prolonged crash exposing investors, especially retail consumers losing their hard-earned money. Consumers need to be alert and extremely cautious as to avoid getting trapped in such Ponzi schemes.”Billionaire investor Mark Cuban, a former Bitcoin critic turned holder, previously emphasized that the concept of intrinsic value simply does not exist. Even fiat currencies such as the US dollar and Indian rupee do not have intrinsic value, given that their valuations are decided by two major factors: the market’s demand and the manipulation of supply by central authorities. Cuban said:“It is interesting because there are a lot of assets which their value is just based on supply and demand. Most stocks, there is no intrinsic value because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. Bitcoin is the same thing. Its value is based on supply demand. I have bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange.”Hence, the Indian finance ministry’s argument in that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are Ponzi scheme-like because they do not have assets backing their value is flawed, as the same argument can be applied to fiat currencies.More importantly, analysts have questioned such irrational statement from the Indian finance ministry considering that the country has just recovered from a disastrous financial turmoil triggered by the country’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi controversial decision to crackdown on criminals by eliminating 500 and 1,000 banknotes.Sunny Ray, the co-founder and president of Unocoin, India’s second largest Bitcoin exchange, wrote:Is bitcoin a pyramid or ponzi scheme? Short answer: no. Long answer: see below. #IndiaBitcoin pic.twitter.com/58eQa2lI1fA sudden and unforeseen crackdown on the national currency led to months-long confusion and financial instability, leading to a period in which fatalities were recorded as people died out of exhaustion waiting in lines to withdraw cash. Because the supply of banknotes was cut so significantly in a short period of time, at one point, more than 90 percent of the country’s ATMs did not have any cash to dispense.In November 2016, LA Times reported that the unprecedented ban on large bills and banknote denominations backfired on the poor, and the vast majority of the population struggled to obtain enough cash to finance day-to-day operations. Ramesh Sisodia, a local merchant, told LA Times:""People don't have money to buy bread — why would they stroll out for a coffee? Those who can afford it would prefer to pay 10 times more for a coffee at Barista — a Starbucks-like chain — because they can pay by card.”Highly regarded Indian Entrepreneur Gaurav Munjal also revealed that a large portion of the population had relied on the barter system to exchange goods because cash was no longer available for the poor and middle class.Day 2 in Bombay with no cash - no ATMs working. Paid the autowalla 5kgs of rice from a store. Long live barter system. pic.twitter.com/uWtejp60AMThe Indian government was condemned for its statement on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market because it has irrationally attacked a decentralized currency system and stores of value that are providing financial stability and independence to their users, unlike the government-owned and issued fiat money.It also falsely claimed that the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on pure speculation, failing to acknowledge the fact that crypto assets of the Bitcoin network, Ripple, Ethereum, and others are being used to send and receive transactions, store wealth, process large payments, run decentralized applications and settle private transactions.""The price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, therefore, is entirely a matter of mere speculation resulting in spurt and volatility in their prices,” the finance ministry added.As a decentralized and distributed currency system which exists on a peer-to-peer protocol, Bitcoin eliminates the necessity of intermediaries and third-party service providers like the Indian central bank. It could render the existence of central authorities and their control over the country’s monetary system useless.But, over the upcoming years, it would become more difficult for certain governments to remain indifferent or negative toward the cryptocurrency market because major markets like the US, Japan, and South Korea have already embraced Bitcoin as a legitimate currency and asset class.",22,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Ponzi Scheme

This may result in an immediate and prolonged crash where investors, particularly the retail consumers, may lose all their hard-earned money.Part of the statement reads:“There is a real and heightened risk of investment bubble of the type seen in Ponzi schemes which can result in sudden and prolonged crash exposing investors, especially retail consumers losing their hard-earned money.

The opinion comes from Bair’s op-ed article published on Yahoo Finance this Tuesday.The former chair further explains that Bitcoin should not be prohibited just for the reason that it has “no readily-apparent intrinsic worth.”In her article, Bair also said that governments should ensure that policies covering digital currencies shouldn’t feed the frenzy and should not make their own value judgments about Bitcoin.“Instead of making its own value judgments about Bitcoin, what government should do is first make sure our policies don’t feed the frenzy.”The fiat currencies in circulation today have also experienced the same predicament that Bitcoin is in at present, Bair claims. According to her, the fiat currencies were created by societies in order to meet the need by the people of a medium to trade and that relied ‘more on psychology than physical attributes.’""Since the beginning of commerce, humans have assigned value to things of no readily-apparent intrinsic worth. Particularly in the case of mediums of exchange, a.k.a. currency, we assign value simply because those with whom we transact do so as well.”Bair added that a government should focus on making sure that a fair and well-informed market is established. A market that is free from fraud, manipulation and outsized speculation.The former FDIC chair’s show of support to Bitcoin is not surprising since she currently serves as an independent advisor and director of several Blockchain and virtual currency projects.Her views, however, are still notable due to her stint at FDIC, an agency that was established by the US Congress to maintain financial confidence and stability.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Investments    #USA    #Government

The watchdog based its decision on the fact that it does not consider digital currencies to be a substitute for money, as they are not legal tender in the country.During a press conference on the issue, FSS Governor Choe Heung-sik claimed that the only role the regulator should play in the digital currency space is warning the public about potential risks:“All we can do is to warn people as we don’t see virtual currencies as actual types of currency, meaning that we cannot step up regulation for now.”He also added that the introduction of any cryptocurrency regulation in the country will only promote digital currency trading, as investors will think that the watchdog already recognizes cryptocurrency as “actual” currency.The remarks of the governor are similar to his previous statements. In November 2017, he announced that the FSS will not directly supervise the operations and activities of digital currency exchanges since the virtual currencies being traded are not legal tender in the country.Given its position, the government was content issuing several rules, rather than establishing regulations, to oversee the local Bitcoin and digital currency industry.In the past, major exchanges in the country braced themselves and were ready to undergo all sorts of regulatory and compliance steps should financial regulators in the country decide to take action.Apart from a number of rules that were already issued, the National Tax Service (NTS) is currently drafting a framework on how to effectively collect taxes on cryptocurrency trading transactions.The NTS will most likely introduce capital gains taxes on companies and individuals who trade digital currencies.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tradings    #Government

There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate Bitcoin.”Bitcoin’s notable price rise this year has been attracting more and more attention not only in mainstream media but from governmental authorities throughout the world. However, individual governments globally are approaching cryptocurrency, and Blockchain technology more broadly, differently.Some of the countries already regulating cryptocurrency include the US and Japan. So far, only a few countries have instituted a full crypto ban, including Morocco and Bolivia. South Korea may follow suit.Last week, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz described how the “noise” around cryptocurrency “keeps him awake at night,” while a US regulator conversely said the “impact” of Bitcoin on global economic policy was barely perceptible.Underscoring the lack of consensus globally on cryptocurrency, the Bank of France Governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, countered the notion that Bitcoin is even a currency, and that it should not be treated as one. At a conference in Beijing last month he reportedly told attendees:“We need to be clear: Bitcoin is in no way a currency, or even a cryptocurrency is a speculative asset.

An example is a recent claim by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, that Bitcoin is a ‘fraud’ and should not be taken seriously.The report also cited various monetary threats, geopolitical risks and cybersecurity threats that confront the global financial system. Bitcoin was not cited as a threat.The virtual currency market registered considerable growth throughout 2017.

Venezuela to Regulate Bitcoin Mining,Joshua Althauser,12/15/2017 18:07,28607,355,"According to local sources, the government of Venezuela is scheduled to launch an online registry for Bitcoin miners by Dec. 22. All Bitcoin miners in the country will be required to sign up. The registry is the first step in the development of a full legal framework to tax and regulate cryptocurrency mining in the country.Proponents of the decision argue that it will protect cryptocurrency miners in the country. Angel Salazar, a member of an advisory commission helping the Venezuelan government implement cryptocurrency regulations, stated:""Miners are working under difficult conditions and formalizing the structure through this registry will help protect them from extortion and harassment.”At a recent press conference, the newly appointed Superintendent of Venezuelan Cryptocurrency, Carlos Vargas claimed that the government is creating the registry to identify and monitor Bitcoin mining more closely, ominously stating:“We want to know who they are, we want to know where they are, we want to know what equipment they are using.”Cryptocurrency mining has gained popularity in Venezuela in the past few months, as it provides gainful employment for both poor and rich Venezuelans who are affected by the ongoing financial crisis in the country, marked by wide-ranging hyperinflation.Although cryptocurrency mining isn't technically illegal in Venezuela, local police have been arresting miners since early 2016, charging them with electricity theft, exchange fraud, cybercrime, and financing terrorism. Extortion is also a serious problem with the police -- miners are sometimes asked to pay protection money in exchange for their charges being dropped.Most recently, during a raid in Lara on Dec. 9, police confiscated 21 mining rigs and arrested the 31-year-old who owned them.The miner was charged with computer crimes, exchange fraud, financing terrorism, damage to the national electric system and money laundering.",19,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Mining    #Venezuela    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
US Fed Chair Speaks Out On Bitcoin and National Crypto,Jon Buck,12/15/2017 12:16,26253,290,"The outgoing US Federal Reserve (the Fed) chair, Janet Yellen, commented on Bitcoin and the Fed’s relationship to the digital currency at a press conference in Washington on Wednesday.During the meeting, Yellen addressed three areas relating to cryptocurrency -- speculation, regulation and government-issued digital currencies. On the nature of Bitcoin, she commented that though the cryptocurrency has seen a remarkable growth in recent months, it is still a “highly speculative asset” and “not a stable source of value."" She also noted that Bitcoin remains a very small part of the overall payment system.Yellen also commented on the Fed’s relationship to Bitcoin. She reiterated her 2014 position that the Fed does not have the authority to regulate the cryptocurrency. On Wednesday, she confirmed that the scope of the Fed’s regulatory power extends only to those banking institutions that they already supervise, stating:""The Fed doesn't really play any regulatory role with respect to Bitcoin, other than assuring that banking organizations that we do supervise are attentive, that they are appropriately managing any interactions they have with participants in that market, and appropriately monitoring anti-money laundering, bank secrecy act responsibilities that they have.”Yellen noted that the Fed does not differentiate between Bitcoin and any other type of currency -- the central bank is responsible for supervising other banks, regardless of the currency being used.During the conference, Yellen also made a distinction between decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin that are neither issued nor given value by any particular state, and digital currencies issued by governments themselves.She stated that, though central bankers globally are discussing the option of making centralized digital currencies that constitute legal tender, at the present moment, the Fed has no serious intention of introducing a digital dollar. She stated:""I really want to caution, this is not something the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at this stage. While we're looking at research on this topic, there are, I think to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a limited need for it and some substantial concerns.""This year multiple governments around the world have indicated their intention to research and implement a national digital currency. Just in the past few months, the governments of Catalonia and Russia declared their interest in issuing their own official digital currencies.

India’s Tax Man Knocks on Door of Cryptocurrency Exchanges; Seeks Identifying Information,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,12/14/2017 22:45,15955,193,"India’s Income Tax Department, which falls under the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance, began conducting surveys across the country on December 13, 2017. Investigators for the government agency visited nine exchanges spread out across Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Cochin and Gurgaon according to India’s Economic Times. The publication also said that these surveys were undertaken under Section 133A of the Income Tax Act, which is for the purpose of gathering evidence.Business Standard reported that the tax men visited exchanges with financial data and inputs already in their possession and wanted to know more about the workings of cryptocurrency exchanges in India. According to the Indian Express, Section 133 A related surveys can be used for:“Gathering evidence for establishing the identity of investors and traders, transaction undertaken by them, identity of counterparties, related bank accounts used, among others.”Indian Express also reported that these investigative teams were under the command of the Bangalore Investigation Wing.The Indian government has been rumbling about Bitcoin of late. We had reported as early as December 6, 2017 about how the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had repeated its warnings on Virtual Currencies. It is important to mention here that the status of Bitcoin and other digital currencies is currently before the Indian Supreme Court.The Reserve Bank, in its warning, had said:“Attention of members of public is drawn to the Press Release issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on December 24, 2013, cautioning users, holders and traders of Virtual Currencies (VCs) including Bitcoins regarding the potential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks associated in dealing with such VCs. Vide press release dated February 1, 2017, RBI has also clarified that it has not given any licence/authorisation to any entity/company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any VC. In the wake of significant spurt in the valuation of many VCs and rapid growth in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), RBI reiterates the concerns conveyed in the earlier press releases.”Increased valuations seem to be the factor behind the tax authorities’ investigations. The Mint newspaper reported that Bitcoin has soared:“17-fold this year as people rushed to buy the digital currency in the hope it will become an alternative to gold or traditional money.”It would also appear from the warnings issued by RBI that valuations are certainly an important factor and the Indian government seems to want to know who is dabbling in cryptocurrencies.India’s income tax raids on Bitcoin are a worrying development for the future of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain in this country of over a billion people. Indian Income Tax authorities have a peremptory character and this sort of “raid” - as it’s known in the local vernacular - can have a severely dampening effect on the nascent crypto sector.It remains to be seen what the motivations of these raids were and if the information that was obtained as a result of them will be used by the department to do a follow-up.

"If True Value of Cryptocurrency Is Freedom, Why Do We Need to Regulate It?",Guest Author,8/1/2017 19:50,15152,577,"Like many technological advantages before it, cryptocurrencies represent massive strides forward in social, economical and technological advances for all of us.To be clear, this reflection shouldn't be taken from a technical stand point, the technical debate around cryptocurrencies is long and in depth and best reserved for another time. This review should be undertaken at a much more top level.Better explained sticking with the aircraft analogy, most of us don't know (or care) how the jet propulsion engine works, but we still happily drink a Gin and Tonic at 40,000 feet while heading off to our next vacation.The same is true of the cryptocurrency. In the future, and indeed today, many individuals will use these technological advances with little to no understanding of the technology behind it. Of course, those of us who follow technology closely will know this ignorance doesn't come from not caring how it works, its the opposite, its putting total faith in the system working, and working well.Let's put it this way, much like the combustion engine or the turbo prop doesn't show us what the car or aircraft truly represents, much of the technology behind the cryptocurrency doesn't show us its true value. Freedom. Freedom to trade across borders with anyone for anything. Now Stop. Think about this for a moment. For the first time in the history of mankind since the “Gold Coin,” the same currency can be used in Moscow to pay for flowers that can be used in Johannesburg to buy a new TV (although, yes, gold coins were not used to buy TV's).Further to that, the concept that my money is worth as much in Downtown London as it is in Uptown Singapore is fundamentally mind blowing. A future in which you are as rich in Dublin as you are in Mumbai is an exciting one that can only help to unify and grow both commerce and the world closer together.However, as the cryptocurrency “grows up” it has had to overcome some serious compliance and regulatory problems internationally. These regulatory issues are numerous in nature depending on which country you read this in. Yet one problem seems to slip under the radar time and time again. Money Laundering. For those of you reading this in certain jurisdictions that don't have laws against Money Laundering, the concept of Laundering is taking funds gained from illegal sources and “filtering” (or as the name implies “laundering”) them to appear as a legitimate source of income. With the rise of much smaller cryptocurrencies in the last few years, money laundering investigators and enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up.As an example of this, the US Department of State (INCSR) identified countries such as Canada, Germany and even France as those of “Primary Concern” for money laundering purposes. To put this into perspective, these countries feature on the same list as countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Guatemala.  While its true there are a number of reasons those countries are included on that list, such as the volume of money attributed to serious organized crime, and various other elements, we would be remiss if we did not seriously consider ?ryptocurrencies role within the battle against money laundering. For anyone who doubts that cryptocurrencies pose a threat with respect to money laundering, on June 27, 2017 a man was arrested in Greece for money laundering $3 bln through the use of cryptocurrencies. More than just pushing a few hundred dollars worth.Therefore, regardless of how you see the future of cryptocurrencies, one thing that needs to be addressed urgently is ensuring compliance with national laws, enforced with a strong anti-money laundering methodology.Companies such as Gresham International have been working with ICO's for the last two years helping new coin offerings to develop compliance frameworks and impact assessments in money laundering hot spots (through more than just simple words in their White Papers).Additionally, they have been taking steps to assist operators of those more well-known currencies to put in place safeguards to assist with making cryptocurrencies safer. In doing so, they are trying to highlight the positives of using a digital based currency over the traditional tangible cash we are all used to.After all, the reality is that money will be laundered regardless of if it is digital or tangible in nature. It's illegal. Where there are laws, there are crimes. No one can blame cryptocurrencies for that.However, looking at it from an objective level, security is one of the key reasons why a number of legislators refuse to give cryptocurrencies of any form domestic backing to operate as a legitimate currency in some jurisdictions.Even in countries such as Montenegro which has no national currency. Those providers who operate in the cryptocurrency world are much more likely to become accepted by not only the legislators but also the general public if they presented a unified front to tackling money laundering at the source. (Politics and other issues aside). Effectively, digital currencies offer something that, unlike the gold coin, mankind truly has never seen before. The ability to stomp out money laundering all together.Through basic track and check status at the source, users can be monitored in their jurisdictions while the currency itself still maintains the freedom we all know and love. Yes, the freedom of cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulated involvement is a blessing.However, we have seen in some cases where that freedom has been a curse, such as the stealing of coins and tokens from individuals and some guy in Greece helping drug cartels clean three billion in cash.Regardless of what side of the regulation vs. freedom side of the fence you sit on one thing is clear. Cryptocurrencies pose amazing possibilities for the future and give us the ability to re-write the playbook on compliance and regulation to suit everyone, not just governments and financial institutions.To best resolve this, people need to stop looking at the old solutions for new technologies.- By Cal EvansCal Evans is an International Technology Lawyer from London who studied Financial Markets at Yale and has experience working with some of the best-known companies in Silicone Valley.

"As China Plans to Regulate ICOs, Blockchain Consortia Form Framework",Joseph Young,7/29/2017 13:40,5264,306,"Six Chinese Blockchain technology industry associations have co-published the Guiyang Blockchain ICO Consensus, to establish an industry-wide standard for initial coin offerings (ICOs).On June 4, Cointelegraph reported that the Chinese central bank, the People’s Bank of China, was planning to regulate the ICO market. The Chinese government intends to pursue its plan to regulate the ICO and Ethereum markets in China, to ensure that token sales and development activity around Ethereum are deemed legal under Chinese financial regulations.At the time, local sources including CnLedger reported that Yao Qian, the head of Digital Currency Research Institute at PBoC, stated that it will regulate ICOs soon and provide a specific regulatory framework for its Ethereum industry.Earlier this week, sources including the China Money Network revealed that six Chinese Blockchain associations have come together to establish an industry-wide framework for ICOs.Considering the fact that there are already 43 Blockchain projects in China that have conducted ICO campaigns, the group of Blockchain associations believed that it was necessary for the industry to regulate itself before the involvement of PBoC.The group includes Guizhou Blockchain Industry Technology Innovation Alliance, Zhongguancun Blockchain Industry Alliance, Blockchain Finance Association, Guiyang Blockchain Innovation Research Institute along with two other unnamed Blockchain associations.According to the China Money Network, China-based Blockchain projects and ICOs have already raised over $420 mln, which is around 30 percent of the total amount of money raised by ICOs to date.The SEC has already started to investigate into ICOs that have conducted their token sale to US-based investors. In the upcoming months, based on the statement of Qian, the PBoC and the Chinese government will likely investigate into major ICOs that have raised tens of millions of dollars in their ICOs.Within less than two years, the ICO market has become a competitor to traditional venture capital firms within the cryptocurrency sector. The vast majority of Blockchain projects and companies have conducted ICO campaigns rather than seeking for early-stage investment. As a result, ICOs have outpaced VC funding in 2017.There are a variety of factors as to why Blockchain projects and companies prefer to conduct ICO campaigns than receive venture capital funding. First off, within the ICO market, there is no pressure from their investors. The vast majority of ICO projects that have raised hundreds of millions of US dollars have demonstrated no viable product or software. Yet, they have obtained large capital within a relatively short period of time.In order to secure that amount of money through traditional and regulated channels, projects and companies need to provide actual market data and evidence of stable user base, consistent revenue and return on investment for investors.Analysts note that it is a positive decision from the six Blockchain associations to self-regulate the ICO market before the PBoC decides to regulate it and prevent ICOs from suffering large penalties or legal violations that could lead to conflicts with the PBoC.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Peopleâ€™s Bank of China    #Markets    #Government    #Investments  
India’s Karnataka State Plans to Regulate Blockchain in Public Sector,Joshua Althauser,7/29/2017 13:12,4073,195,"Government officials in Karnataka State, India have scheduled a seminar to tackle issues over the use of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the state.The move may eventually result in the enactment of new laws for the digital currency market.In his tweet in late July 2017, Priyank Kharge said that the event will focus on Blockchain for governance and Bitcoin. Kharge leads the state’s information technology and biotechnology programs.Govt will soon host a seminar to understand blockchains for governance & bitcoins. If necessary evolve a policy. https://t.co/R4JoglCyygThe government of Karnataka is already advancing efforts to establish a new legal framework for digital currencies or virtual currencies. The move is due to such factors as the increasing market size of cryptocurrencies, the rising cases of fraud and the expanding investor base of digital currencies.One of the possible solutions to regulate the cryptocurrency market is the introduction of a goods and services tax to transactions using digital currencies. There are, however, several issues that were raised like which agency will be responsible for supervising the market. Among the possible regulators are the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).Aside from Karnataka, there are other Indian states which are planning or moving to adopt or integrate the Blockchain technology and digital currencies in the public sector.Both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are advancing projects aimed at integrating Blockchain technology in their land registry systems. The projects are part of the digital reworking of the land registration process in both states.Moreover, the Telangana government is also planning to use Blockchain to improve the operations of its Revenue Department. The project will be supported by India’s Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC).",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Government    #Digital Currency    #Markets    #Transactions    #Reserve Bank of India  
US Retailer Overstock Welcomes SEC Ruling on Trading Regulated ICOs,Joshua Althauser,7/28/2017 18:40,11457,129,"As a growing number of companies and industries involved in cryptocurrency weigh in SEC’s latest decision, US retailer Overstock has lauded the ruling body in its decision to regulate the trading of initial coin offerings (ICO).In its mid-2017 report, the SEC said that once a digital token issued in an ICO is considered as a security, its trading should only be participated in by national securities exchanges such as Nasdaq and some alternative trading systems (ATS).The retail giant has already established its regulated, Blockchain-powered stock exchange called tO, which is involved in the selling of tokenized and compliant securities. The exchange has successfully traded the first SEC-regulated crypto securities in December 2016.However, the promise of a new era of regulated Blockchain securities was abruptly cut short by the emergence of the wildly popular concept called an ICO. An ICO is an unregulated means of raising funds for a certain project using cryptocurrencies. It is aimed at cutting out licensed platform providers like tO and the regulators altogether.In his comment on the emergence of ICOs, tO President Joseph Cammarata said that he compares the ICOs to the Wild West:""We were kind of annoyed when these ICOs started taking off. They weren't getting approval, it was the Wild West. We thought long and hard about doing our own ICO ... But we held off, going down the regulatory road.""The concept of regulated ICOs in which there are no middlemen involved in the trading is gradually being advanced in the financial services industry.In early 2017, Blockchain Capital has raised $10 mln of a $50 mln fund through the sale of its tokenized securities. The company exploited the same JOBS Act exemptions cited in the SEC report in conducting its regulated ICO.Several ICOs are also looking to advance compliance projects and are already in the works as of mid-2017.",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #US    #SEC    #Overstock    #Exchanges  
Washington State Requires Bitcoin Exchanges to Secure Licenses,Joshua Althauser,7/28/2017 16:50,4713,111,"Washington State legislators have started the implementation of new regulations covering digital currency exchanges adopted on July 23, 2017. State legislators passed the money transmitter bill in April and submitted it to Governor Jay Inslee for signing.Under the new law, cryptocurrency exchanges should secure a license from the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions before they can conduct their business in the state. They are also required to provide a third-party audit of their data systems.The other requirements include the new transmitter bond requirement, with the amount of the bond to be determined based on the amount of cryptocurrency exchanged in the previous year.State legislators have started deliberating Senate Bill 5031 in January. The bill aims to amend the state’s existing transmission laws to cover companies that are involved in transactions using digital currencies.A part of the bill states:""A licensee transmitting virtual currencies must hold like-kind virtual currencies of the same volume as that held by the licensee but which is obligated to consumers in lieu of the permissible investments required in of this subsection.""There were contrasting views and moves of several cryptocurrency exchanges on the new regulation. Exchanges Poloniex and Bitfinex have announced that they would cease operating in the state due to the new law.New York-based exchange startup Gemini, meanwhile, has secured approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to start its operation in Washington in early 2017.According to NYDFS Superintendent Maria T.

"SEC Deals Blow To ICOs: DAO Tokens Are Securities, Subject to Securities Laws",Jacob J,7/26/2017 7:40,11181,178,"Initial Coin Offerings have had a free run until now, raising millions of dollars in a matter of minutes thanks to a cryptocurrency frenzy. All that may change now, with the SEC concluding that ICO tokens may be securities and subject to federal securities laws.It was found that the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) tokens which were issued in 2016 were securities.There has been a spate of Initial Coin Offerings recently, which have managed to raise millions of dollars.Some organizations have found ICOs to be a convenient method to raise money for development, by tapping a new set of investors and avoiding the hassles associated with the traditional venture capital route.There are no disclosure norms to be followed and anybody can invest in ICOs. Most investors consider ICOs a speculative asset and their interest in ICOs stem primarily from the rapid appreciation in price of the issued tokens, rather than the strength of the underlying business model.The ‘easy money’ associated with ICOs has resulted in many fly-by-night operators issuing tokens and resulted in regulators across the world examining the legality of such offerings.The SEC’s Enforcement Division had launched an investigation into whether the DAO and associated entities were subject to securities laws when they launched the sale of DAO tokens for Ether.The investigation concluded the DAO token was indeed a security and the sale of these tokens were subject to federal securities laws.Although the DAO was described as a crowdfunding contract, it did not meet the requirements of the Regulation Crowdfunding exemption, as it was not a registered broker-dealer/funding portal.Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division said""The innovative technology behind these virtual transactions does not exempt securities offerings and trading platforms from the regulatory framework designed to protect investors and the integrity of the markets.""The SEC has decided not to file charges in this particular case, but use it as an opportunity to caution the industry and participants about ICOs. Securities laws apply to all entities which issue securities, irrespective of whether the entity is a traditional company or decentralized organization.It does not matter whether the securities are purchased using fiat currency or using virtual currencies. The SEC has issued an investor bulletin, highlighting the risks associated with ICOs to investors.While the SEC has unequivocally concluded that the DAO tokens were indeed securities, not all ICOs have been brought under securities laws. It has stated that the facts and circumstances of any investment transaction (including economic realities) will determine whether the transaction constitutes the offer of sale of a security.Token issuers may now have to turn to lawyers to confirm that the token that they intend to issue does not qualify as a security under federal securities laws.If it indeed qualifies as a security, then the compliance costs associated with the offering may outweigh the benefits of raising money through an ICO.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Tokens    #DAO    #Security    #Law    #SEC  
State of Delaware Governor Signs Blockchain Legislation,Joshua Althauser,7/25/2017 17:30,9674,277,"State of Delaware Governor John C. Carney Jr. has officially signed the bill that was introduced and passed last May 4, 2017. The bill turned into law would officially legalize and recognize Blockchain transactions for accounting and other business records for companies registered in the state.A portion of the law explains:“Any records administered by or on behalf of the corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any information storage device, method, or one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time.""In spite of the vague wording in the bill, this fairly means that corporate entities, many of which are registered in Delaware, can store financial records in any electronic means regardless of the traditional technical requirements on how it’s done, which includes Blockchain records.As long as these records can be printed on paper “within a reasonable time” the State of Delaware would accept these records as authentic and verifiable.After a swift passage this effectively amends Delaware's General Corporation Law, Blockchain advocates sought to label the passage as a""historic"" milestone, given the State of Delaware now recognizes electronic transactions recorded in Blockchains as verifiable data.Therefore, it defines with certainty that all transactions are done using cryptocurrencies and can now be recorded in accounting ledgers without question of its validity. This could potentially help prevent future taxation-related problems and more centralized records of the corporations.Jack Markell, former Delaware governor, has also launched an initiative to promote Blockchain efficiencies in government with this law being one of the baby steps.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Delaware    #Transactions    #Law  
Texas Congressman Calls for Stricter Cryptocurrency Regulations,Joshua Althauser,7/24/2017 9:23,31529,263,"Texas congressman Roger Williams has called for controls on cryptocurrencies to ensure they do not aid crime or terrorist activities.The rapid rise in popularity of Bitcoin has highlighted the evolution of cryptocurrency. Consequently, it has invited a lot of criticism and skepticism as well.  Most skeptics address risks due to high volatility, lack of consumer protection and the possibility of problems in central control on currency in cases of cryptocurrency being used at a large scale.Williams has called for cryptocurrency startups to be subjected to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations.These points were added as an addendum to a hearing entitled ""Virtual Currency: Financial Innovation and National Security Implications,"" held by the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance of the House Financial Services Committee on July 8, 2017.While Williams acknowledged that cryptocurrency is restructuring international finance and is increasingly offering a wide range of unprecedented opportunities, he stressed that it needs to be monitored.Since cryptocurrency is run through digital media, it makes it vulnerable to being used by anti-state elements, terrorists and criminals, he claims.Hence, it must have protective regulations to ensure it is not misused. To accomplish this, Williams suggested that all the cryptocurrencies in circulation must be subject to same legal requirements as the other financial institutions.The argument put forward by digital currency operators and users is that cryptocurrency requires relaxation of these regulations to function efficiently. Williams disagrees, insisting that safeguards and controls will ensure that criminal activities are not aided and that it is used for betterment only.",28,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Texas    #AML    #KYC    #USA  
"Thousands of Japanese Retailers, Restaurants May Halt Accepting Bitcoin",Lisa Froelings,7/22/2017 11:20,20218,197,"More than 5,000 retail stores and restaurants in Japan may stop accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment starting Aug. 1, 2017. This possibility could push through if Bitcoin payment processors will halt their services.The retailers and restaurants accept Bitcoin through payment processors bitFlyer and Coincheck. The latter is also partnering with Recruit Lifestyle in order to expand its operation and accept more than 260,000 additional stores across Japan as clients.BitFlyer, however, has announced that it could stop Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, along with its payment services from July 31 to Aug. 2. Coincheck has separately announced that it will temporarily halt Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal starting Aug. 1.The company says:“On Aug. 1, 2017, we may temporarily suspend Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal for Coincheck exchange and payment services to protect users assets…The resume date is unspecified, but we expect several hours to several days. Also, if we decide that a Bitcoin fork will not take place on Aug. 1, 2017, 12 am, the suspension of services will not happen.”The move by the government of Japan to recognize the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a legal tender in the country has led to the increase in the number of stores and retailers which use it in their operations.Among them are restaurant chain Heichinrou, eyeglass retail chain Meganesuper and the electronics retail group Bic Camera.The plans by the payment processors and the various Japanese establishments were triggered by impending developments in Bitcoin platform. These include the planned scaling for Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the possible split of the platform.The plans to temporarily halt Bitcoin payments, however, are expected to have limited effects on the operations of the retailers and restaurants as their businesses are mainly transacted in cash or credit cards.",15,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Payments    #BitFlyer    #Coincheck    #Government    #SegWit  
China Reforms Financial Regulatory Body to Improve Financial Security,Joshua Althauser,7/21/2017 23:40,13279,95,"From June 14 - 15, 2017, China held the fifth National Financial Work Conference in Beijing, manifesting a new regulatory institution. The institution is called the National Financial Stability and Development Committee, which will be the decision-making body that has the power to supervise the existing Chinese regulatory agencies.Since 1997, China has been conducting the National Financial Work Conference twice every 10 years. The conference was created to review current financial policies and the agencies that will regulate them. All these are geared towards the improvement of China's financial system.During the meeting, members have discussed the reformation that the National Financial Stability and Development Committee will bring. One of their major roles is to control the jurisdictional overlaps of the other three regulatory bodies in China.Now under their supervision are The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), and the  China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). One more bank included in the list is the People’s Bank of China (PBoC).The new financial regulatory body is to organize and centralize the interactions of the regulatory bodies in an effort to grow the economy in accordance with China’s 13th Five-Year Plan. Also, according to the director of China’s Financial Reform Institute, Liu Shengjun, the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China deem that the changes are critical steps for increasing national financial security.In his op-ed, Shenjun also explained the five areas of the new financial regulation that supports this idea.Recent news also suggests that along with the goal of economic  improvement, China is also aiming  to modernize the economy.

Corrupt Governments Tend to Declare Bitcoin Illegal: Analysis,Guest Author,7/17/2017 18:55,20166,625,"Many governments impose heavy regulation on Bitcoin with the justification that Bitcoin can and has been used to aid illegal activities. What governments do not say is that that Bitcoin is a medium of exchange that is outside of their control.Given this fact, it’s time to inquire about other motives/agendas that may underlie efforts to regulate Bitcoin and other digital currencies. I developed an index of Bitcoin regulation in 62 countries and correlated it with a well-known index of government corruption in the same countries during 2016.This analysis finds that corrupt governments tend to declare Bitcoin illegal while countries with good governance have a friendly regulatory framework for Bitcoin. Fear of Bitcoin as a trustless, decentralized and transparent transaction network may play a role in authoritarian governments’ distrust of Bitcoin.Bitcoin regulations are rapidly evolving country by country. In some countries such as the US, additional layers of regulations are being imposed at the state level.Classifying these regulations is difficult, but various websites collect and summarize information. Wikipedia summarizes and references current legal developments of Bitcoin and other digital currency.Although limited, these data sources were used to create a Bitcoin Regulation Index (BRI) for 62 countries. The system for ordering Bitcoin acceptance by countries uses a scale of 0-100 with 0 defined as Bitcoin is illegal and 100 means Bitcoin is completely unregulated by the government and the government has deliberately decided not to regulate.Several values also exist between the two ends of the scale. A value of 25 means Bitcoin is legal, but banks and other financial institutions are prohibited from using it. A value of 50 means Bitcoin is legal, but the government strongly discourages its use. A value of 75 means Bitcoin is legal and the government is regulating use in some fashion. Finally, a value of 90 means Bitcoin is legal, but unregulated due to lack of government oversight. The second column for Table 1 shows the BRI for 2016 for each of the 62 countries under.Governance is essential to the general performance of an economy and its components.For example, according to the World Bank:“Weaknesses in governance – governance being defined as the way in which public institutions perform their functions in a country – are strongly correlated with deficiencies in development. Bad governance is associated with corruption, distortion of government budgets, inequitable growth, social exclusion, and lack of trust in authorities. Inefficiency of formal governance institutions leads to creation of informal institutions that substitute for the functions that the formal ones are unable to perform.”Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) provides one measure of good governance. The CPI is an index which describes the quality of governance annually for many countries since 1996.The CPI describes governance in a country by a number in the [0, 100] interval with 100 reflecting excellent governance. The CPI for 2016 for each of the 62 countries under consideration is shown in the infographics.The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables which falls in the [-1, 1] interval. The correlation coefficient between BRI and CPI for 2016 is .31.""This positive relationship suggests that good governance is positively associated with a friendly regulatory environment for Bitcoin from a global perspective. Inversely, corrupt regimes tend to pursue more stringent regulation of Bitcoin and probably other digital currencies.""Given the limitations and qualitative nature of the data sets used, a positive correlation, although not at the strongest level, does support anecdotal evidence of country corruption and hostility toward Bitcoin.Another way to look at the data is to combine the BRI and CPI scores by country to get a ranking. A maximum score of 200 is possible for a country with good governance and a Bitcoin friendly regulatory environment while the lowest possible score is 0 for a country with bad governance and laws making Bitcoin illegal.  The infographics shows the rankings of the top scoring countries and the bottom scoring countries.  It is interesting that some of the more corrupt regimes on the planet, as measured by the CPI, seem to have found an interest in making an effort to declare Bitcoin, and by extension other digital currencies, illegal.  In contrast, countries widely regarded as models of good governance have accepted Bitcoin.The limited data available show a positive correlation between a Bitcoin friendly regulatory environment and good governance.  This could indicate that the potential for digital currencies and the underlying Blockchain technology may be a threat to countries that rank low in the corruption index, which generally measures the misuse of public power for private benefits.  Of course, there could be another explanation. The countries that had the highest combined score also were high-income nations while the countries with the lowest combined score were very poor nations. Some less developed countries may simply not understand digital currencies and the Blockchain and are reluctant to accept such technologies for that reason.If it is true that corrupt governments tend to impose heavy restrictions on, if not outright ban, Bitcoin, then the next question to ask is why?  Authoritarian governments tend to either control or ban certain products or ideas that are a threat to their power. Bitcoin, due to its decentralized nature, has an essentially incorruptible ledger. Corrupt governments may understand the potential for a more transparent and trustless ledger to counteract government abuses and so they fear it.The Bitcoin regulatory environment is rapidly changing and the conclusions here are subject to change. There are also some good governance countries that remain suspicious of Bitcoin.The analysis does suggest that governments, where public power is routinely used for private gain, may see Bitcoin and the Blockchain underlying it as a threat rather than a helpful technology.- By Jennifer L.

The risk of terror groups using anonymous funds has made the government leery of embracing them and surely have contributed to the “never” approach.Other countries have warned against the presumed dangers of cryptocurrencies as well.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Egypt    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Markets  
Bitcoin To Be Taxed Like Gold In India,Darryn Pollock,7/14/2017 13:30,12067,475,"India is tabling ideas on how to integrate Bitcoin into the country's regulations and, with banning it being an unpopular option, it seems that a goods-and-services tax may be slapped on instead.In recent months a legal framework has been discussed by Indian officials as to how best to integrate the booming digital currency into its structures. A taskforce has been working to determine the legality of things like Bitcoin under the law in India as there was once a thought to place a full blanket ban on the currency in the heavily populated nation.Now, however, it is being reported that taxes are the probable outcome from this enquiry which will render the cryptocurrency legal, but also affect its growth as a decentralized alternative currency.It seems likely that the regulatory regime that comes in to monitor Bitcoin and its affiliated digital currencies will fall under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).This board will then hope to treat digital currencies much like gold; trading it on registered exchanges and thus promoting a formal tax.This will also allow the regulators to keep tabs on the transactions in order to stop nefarious uses such as money laundering, terror funding, and drug trafficking.Banning digital currencies has been discussed in India, but also dismissed, which has led the taskforce to consider alternatives that will allow the government some sort of regulation in order to maintain a supervised ecosystem over the anonymous currency.One of the officials told The Hindu Publication:""Banning will give a clear message that all related activities are illegal and will disincentivize those interested in taking speculative risks, but it was pointed out it will impede tax collection on gains made in such activities and that regulating the currency instead would signal a boost to blockchain technology, encourage the development of a supervision ecosystem (that tracks legal activities and may also assist in tracking illegal activities) and promote a formal tax base.""This is but one of the ideas that is being tossed around, with another idea to take a less regulated and controlled stance, leaving the risk in the hands of the users.In this case, cryptocurrencies would not be recognised by the government, and all risks associated will fall onto those who use them, but any illegal activities conducted through them will be addressed.Blockchain technology, however, will be promoted and held in a separate light from the digital currency it supports.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taxes    #India    #Digital Currency    #Transactions    #Government  
Reserve Bank of India ?losely Watching Transactions With Cryptocurrencies,Jacob J,7/14/2017 11:15,8811,180,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is keeping a close watch on transactions involving cryptocurrencies, says RBI Governor Urjit Patel to Parliamentary Panel.The Indian Government has taken multiple moves to curb tax evasion. The government demonetized high value currency notes in November 2016, in an attempt to flush out black money stored in the form of cash.It has also cracked down on tax havens like Mauritius and passed stringent laws against corruption and tax evasion. The government has imposed a cap of INR 200,000 (~$3,000) for cash transactions.Given the increasing popularity of Bitcoin in India, politicians have raised concerns that Bitcoin could be used for money laundering.""Bitcoin trades at a premium in Indian markets, primarily due to high demands and capital controls which make purchases from international exchanges difficult.""As per Mint, the members of the Standing Committee on Finance raised concerns about increasing the number of cryptocurrency transactions and wanted the views of the RBI governor on the legality of these transactions.Members also stated that it is difficult to establish the source of funds for these transactions, raising the possibility of money laundering.The Governor of the RBI assured the parliamentary committee that the RBI is keeping a close watch on such transactions and an inter-disciplinary committee is looking into their legality.The debate on the Indian legal position was kicked off in March 2017, when Kirit Somaiya, a Member of Parliament raised questions on whether Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme and could be used for money laundering.Although the RBI had periodically warned Bitcoin users about the risks involved, it had shied away from explicitly commenting on the legality of Bitcoins.The government had formed a committee in April 2017 to study the prevailing framework for virtual currencies.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Reserve Bank    #India    #Transactions    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Cash    #Markets  
US Legislators Partner With MIT and NIST to Develop Blockchain Security Standards,Joshua Althauser,8/23/2017 22:59,11443,881,"The group of US lawmakers called the Congressional Blockchain Caucus has partnered with several institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to study how to establish security standards for the use of Blockchain technology in the country.In a recent podcast, the House Joint Economic Committee said that their group is committed to speeding the adoption of Blockchain technology for the benefit of the American public. Co-chairperson David Schweikert said:""It is our job as members of Congress…to embrace and in some ways evangelize what these things could mean for economic growth and society.""Schweikert added that the technology is among the disruptive and elegant ideas that could transform the society for the better.The Congressional Blockchain Caucus was launched in September 2016 to advance the mainstream adoption of the Blockchain technology in the US. The caucus was launched by a group of lawmakers led by Congressmen Jared Polis and Mick Mulvaney.The launching of the caucus coincided with the inauguration of the DC Blockchain Center, which is an information center for policymakers. The center was founded by the trade association Chamber of Digital Commerce and the technology incubator 1776 to serve as a platform for the public and private sectors to collaborate on possible Blockchain applications.During the month, the House of Representatives has also approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for the drafting of a national technology innovation policy including a supportive language for digital currencies and Blockchain.These developments have shown increasing interest and support for Blockchain technology by both the government and private sector.",3,  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation  
Japan Financial Services Agency Claims that 50 Bitcoin Exchanges Filed for License,Joshua Althauser,8/22/2017 22:13,17246,984,"The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has announced that it received registration applications from 50 Bitcoin exchanges as of August 2017. The applications are being reviewed for compliance.A report by the local newspaper Sankei Shimbun claimed that the agency has started their review on whether the exchanges dealing with virtual currencies like Bitcoin have implemented measures aimed at protecting their users.The government of Japan amended its fund settlement law in April 2017 to allow recognition of Bitcoin as a legal payment method. Many have credited that decision with Bitcoin’s extraordinary bull run this year.With that approval, the FSA was required to ensure the registration of virtual currency exchanges in the country. Exchanges must be registered by the end of September.Under the law, the FSA should ensure that the exchanges are compliant with the requirements before they can be officially registered. Among the requirements are the implementation of appropriate measures to guarantee the full protection of users. Additionally, exchanges are required to communicate with the FSA about the risk of financial losses due to such factors as price volatility.The FSA also checks whether the assets of an exchange are clearly separated from its user deposits and ensures that a proper risk management system is established.Major companies in Japan are already adding Bitcoin exchanges to their service offerings. In March 2016, the publicly-traded conglomerate Remix Point Inc. launched its Bitcoin exchange called Bitpoint. Fisco Ltd., a Jasdaq-listed financial information provider, has introduced its Bitcoin exchange.The other companies which set up exchanges include Internet major GMO, SBI Holdings, and the Money Partners Group.The continued integration of Bitcoin into Japan’s economy almost certainly bodes well for its continued price appreciation.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Japan

The third largest Bitcoin exchange has already secured regulatory clearance in 34 states for customers to buy and sell Bitcoin through its US entity, bitFlyer USA.The company’s desire to reach the US is in line with the vision of its CEO, Yuzo Kano, who said:“While bitFlyer, Inc. is headquartered in Japan, my vision was always to create a global company, and I am excited that the US will be its first step toward global expansion. Bitcoin is a global currency, and now our exchange will be global too.”The announcement also indicated that the exchange would target institutional investors and professional traders and then move to the public sector.The announcement from bitFlyer follows on the heels of other large exchanges and Bitcoin companies offering new and improved ways for consumers to buy, sell and use their Bitcoin.CryptoPay’s recent announcement of a future trading platform, as well as increasing numbers of crypto debit cards, indicate that accessibility is growing globally. BitFlyer’s business model includes such mainstream acceptance.BitFlyer’s COO said:“There is a concept of ‘Mrs. Watanabe’ in the Japanese forex market; she is the personification of household trading in Japan. BitFlyer aims to be the first exchange to allow US Bitcoin traders to trade with Mrs. Watanabe.”Exchanges are not the only system proliferating. Other companies are also installing ATMs in regions where none existed previously, increasing accessibility.The recent statement from Bitlish about 5,000 new ATMs in Europe before year end, as well as other companies adding ATMs globally, will continue to increase access.Daniel Polotsky, CEO of CoinFlip, a Bitcoin ATM provider, stated:“The crypto ATM is fantastic because it spurs the adoption of cryptocurrency via a familiar model (an ATM) and a familiar medium of exchange (cash).

Australian Government Moves to Regulate Cryptocurrency Exchanges,Joshua Althauser,8/18/2017 14:42,10052,362,"The Australian government has introduced legislation in mid-August 2017 that will regulate virtual currency exchanges in the country.The bill forms part of the plan by the government to strengthen the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act and bolster the authority of the Australian Transactions and Reporting Analysis Centre (Austrac).In its announcement, the coalition government said that the bill will empower Austrac to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.Austrac is a financial intelligence agency which is responsible for implementing the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations:“The bill provides a net regulatory relief to industry of $36 mln annually, with the digital currency exchange sector being regulated for the first time, while deregulating low-risk industries such as cash-in-transit, which is already subject to state and territory licensing requirements.”Australia is just one of the countries worldwide to regulate cryptocurrencies and prevent money laundering in their jurisdictions.In Japan, the government has approved Bitcoin as a form of payment across the country in April 2017.The government has also implemented tough rules on Bitcoin exchanges to comply with the country’s AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.In China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has conducted probes on the operation of Bitcoin exchanges in the country. These investigations prompted the exchanges to stop Bitcoin withdrawals and upgraded their systems to comply with the AML and KYC requirements.In the EU, governments have been discussing the imposition of rules and regulations covering Bitcoin exchanges as part of the region’s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.Meanwhile, several Australian lawmakers and government officials have expressed their opposition to the adoption of digital currencies.Among them is leftist opposition leader Bill Shorten, who wants to stop the use of digital currencies, including Bitcoin, because they could be exploited by terrorists.Two senators, however, proposed that Bitcoin should be adopted as the country’s official currency to bolster its financial competitiveness.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Government    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Money Laundering  
Terror Attacks to Threaten Bitcoin Anonymity in Europe,Darryn Pollock,8/17/2017 19:00,6990,195,"European regulators are looking to cut terrorism off at its source by stopping its funding in the wake of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks. For them, this means casting a scrutinizing eye over the anonymous digital currencies such as Bitcoin.The European Commission (the legislative arm of the European Union), has already taken steps to crack open the anonymous nature of Bitcoin when in June it updated its anti-money laundering rules to force digital currency exchanges to check their clients are who they claim.Because cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are characterized by the ability to send and receive money with no need to identify oneself to a centralized authority, regulators fear that it could be an attractive avenue for criminals to use.However, there is not a lot of evidence that suggests terrorists are all rushing to use Bitcoin, or that the digital currency is funding terrorists’ plights.Customer verification is already a major part of established exchanges, and it is this sort of controls that the commission hopes will help in monitoring criminal activities, as well as money laundering.""The Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms under the scope of the anti-money laundering directive, so that these platforms have to apply customer due-diligence controls when exchanging virtual for real currencies, ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges,"" the European Commission said in a news release.Because Exchanges, like Kraken, for example, are already in compliance, the effects of European regulation has been negligible. According to Garrick Hileman, an academic at the University of Cambridge in England's Judge Business School, exchanges already operate with best practice on anti-money laundering and ""know your customer"" rules.Allegedly, part of the crackdown has come from the supposed funding of the so-called Islamic State through the Dark Web.""There is a shadow banking system that now exists around the world that is capable of moving unlimited amounts of money… Terrorists know the banking system is well-monitored,"" Scott Dueweke, the founder of Zebryx, a digital identity consultancy, told CNBC.",4,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Anonymous    #Paris    #Brussels  
Ukraine Issues Clarification on Legal Status of Bitcoin,Joshua Althauser,8/15/2017 10:03,10343,236,"Ukraine’s central bank, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), has issued a statement about the regulations covering digital currencies like Bitcoin, as well as the legal status of the cryptocurrencies.The move was made by the central bank following the arrest of several individuals for allegedly mining Bitcoin illegally in the second week of August 2017.During a raid at the state-owned Paton Electric Welding Institute in the country’s capital of Kiev, the Ukrainian National Police has found 200 computers that were set up in an unused swimming pool inside the institute’s campus for Bitcoin mining.In its statement, the NBU clarified that there is only one currency that is being used in Ukraine and that is the hryvnia. No other currency or substitute currency can be issued or used as a form of payment in the country other than hryvnia.The NBU also claimed that the status of Bitcoin in the country is complicated by the absence of a consolidated effort to classify and manage the cryptocurrency around the world as it is considering to better regulate digital currencies:“In different countries, Bitcoin is classified in different ways – as virtual currency, money surrogate, intangible value, virtual goods and the like. For its part, the NBU has not officially supported any of the above definitions.”Several lawyers, however, have contradicted the position statement issued by the NBU. They claimed that cryptocurrency mining is lawful in the country.According to law firm Yuskutum managing partner Artem Afyan, engaging in digital currency mining in the country is absolutely legal:“The arguments of the National Bank that the cryptocurrency is an unsecured ‘money surrogate’ are only a warning. It does not mean prohibition of their use.”",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ukraine    #NBU    #Cryptocurrencies    #Bitcoin Mining    #Payments  
"Mainstream Acceptance of Bitcoin is Almost Certain, But We’re Not There Yet",David Dinkins,8/14/2017 22:42,21519,630,"The current bull market is outrageous. Long-dead altcoins are being pumped to 10,000% gains, ICOs are raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and the talk over on /r/ethtrader is dominated by folks with lambos. In the midst of it all, Bitcoin has gradually increased its price, from just over $1000 at the beginning of the year to $4250 at press time.Many are calling this market a bubble, saying that everything that goes up must come down eventually. They are likely correct this time. But there is reason to believe that digital currency is beginning to reach mainstream acceptance.Regulatory uncertainty is arguably the biggest obstacle to the mass adoption of digital currencies. While tales of “Bitcoin bans” have gradually faded over the years, and governments are looking more favorably upon digital currency, it still has a long way to go. The biggest regulatory obstacles are tax policy, anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and securities regulators.Recently the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a report condemning many ICOs as violating securities laws. This has resulted in Bitfinex ceasing all trade of ERC20 (ICO) tokens and suspending service to U.S. users.Despite this, most regulators do seem to hold generally favorable views, or are at least willing to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Japan and South Korea both officially legalized digital currency in recent months, which has proven to be quite a boon to the markets. A large percentage of exchange volume has been coming from both those countries recently, fueling the current bull run.Though the IRS issued general guidance on taxes in early 2014, many questions remain unanswered. The agency has also shown a troubling propensity to go on fishing expeditions, exemplified by the recent subpoenas against Coinbase.The IRS has further confused things by declaring that Bitcoin will be taxed like property. This means that even buying a cup of coffee becomes a taxable event. According to U.S. tax law, you actually owe capital gains taxes on any currency appreciation you might have experienced. That’s because you’re technically selling your digital currency in order to purchase coffee, which means you are “realizing” a capital gain.Globally, tax authorities still have a great deal to figure out. Some countries treat digital currency as property, others as currency, and still others have no policies at all.Bitcoin’s first attempt to enter the mainstream financial system began in 2014, when the Winklevoss twins proposed a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). An ETF tracks the price of an underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin. The Winklevoss ETF would have had to purchase Bitcoin every time investors bought shares, and they would have sold Bitcoin every time investors sold shares.ETFs are important because they are very easy for both ordinary investors and institutions to use. Pensions funds and other institutional investors don’t want the headache and challenges that come with trying to store and secure Bitcoin. For that matter, neither does your grandma.Both ordinary investors and institutions are looking for an easy way to purchase and hold Bitcoin. ETFs offer that ease-of-use. ETFs are also an easy way to invest tax-advantaged retirement funds in Bitcoin.Unfortunately, the SEC has so far rejected two Bitcoin ETF proposals, citing inadequate markets. The SEC is concerned that the markets on which Bitcoin trades are largely unregulated, which could allow manipulation of Bitcoin prices in a way that would be harmful to mainstream investors.The good news is that the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a bit more optimistic about Bitcoin. They recently gave permission to a company called LedgerX to offer Bitcoin futures. This is doubly good, because the SEC hinted that they may reconsider their decision on a Bitcoin ETF in the event that regulated futures markets are developed.The Bitcoin Investment Trust, whose shares trade under the GBTC ticker, also provides a way for investors to hold Bitcoin in their retirement account. While GBTC does not offer the same advantages as an ETF, or the same appeal to institutional investors, it is an early inroad into the traditional financial system.Many digital currency exchanges have been under fire lately because of their inability to handle the huge volume of orders being generated as a result of this bull market. GDAX, Kraken, Poloniex, and others have all been blamed for poor (or nonexistent) order execution, heavy lag, connectivity problems, and poor customer service.To be fair, none of them had any reason to believe that digital currency adoption would come so quickly. Nobody foresaw the present market mania. Still, it seems reasonable that a digital currency exchange that really believed in the future of digital money would have built considerable over-capacity.Bitcoin and other digital currencies desperately need reliable and fast exchanges. Until cryptocurrency exchanges are as good as mainstream stock exchanges and brokerages, the adoption of digital currency is going to be stymied.However, all of these exchanges have pointed out that they are increasing their capacity and ramping up their operations as quickly as possible. They also have plenty of money, as fees from their incredibly high trade volumes should easily finance new systems.Finally, Blockchain is everywhere. It’s almost impossible to read industry news without hearing something about a new Blockchain-based system that is being tested or piloted somewhere. Recently there has been news about Blockchain in medicine, Blockchain in the food supply chain, and Blockchain in government.Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt a great many industries and become a game-changer worldwide. Every time a new Blockchain initiative is successful, people are reminded of the original Blockchain application: Bitcoin.",19,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Government  
National Bank of Ukraine Considers Regulating Digital Currencies,Joshua Althauser,8/14/2017 18:18,17385,187,"Despite its previous plans to go cashless, Ukraine’s Central Bank has hinted that it may begin regulating the use of cryptocurrencies in the country.According to the central bank, legal issues involving the use of digital currencies will be tackled at the scheduled Financial Stability Board of Ukraine meeting in late August 2017.The central bank also announced that discussion about virtual currencies will be the main focus of the meeting.

How Blockchain Can Help Solve Global Regulatory Challenges: Analysis,Guest Author,8/14/2017 10:17,10668,452,"In today’s world, talk abounds about the ever-increasing regulatory hurdles every modern global industry now faces.The way to address any risk is to impose more and more regulations on an industry to ensure the sins of the past are not repeated, and politicians can best show the electorate concrete steps in legislation they have developed to prevent future disasters.  The issue currently facing businesses is the ever-increasing burden of regulations responsible for driving up costs.The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis has determined regulatory costs of $1.9 tln amounting to 10 percent of the US gross domestic product, which was estimated for 2016 at more than $18.8 tln.Additionally, if one considers all costs of federal regulation and intervention flowing all the way down to households, US households would pay 21 percent of the average income – or $14,809 annually – in a regulatory hidden tax, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.Previously, these regulations were limited by the counterweight of global competition and the need to be price competitive at a country level.The reality today is that we live in a global economy and pervasive standards are set in industries regardless of where a company operates.Failing to comply with these standards and regulations alienates a company from the global economy – giving a strong economic rationale to participate in these standards and regulatory activities.  How can we reduce the burden and cost of compliance? And how can we be transparent to an increasingly global regulatory environment?If you produce drugs, for example, you need to comply with US FDA regulations and pass regular audits to access the marketplace.If you trade in US currency, even if it’s with only one financial US branch, then you need to comply globally with US financial regulations.If you plan to sell anything to an EU citizen, then you must comply with the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standards (even if you don’t have operations in the EU).  To comply with regulations, you need to prove you have done the right thing in implementing them while providing a clear audit trail to auditors.     Increasingly, these auditors are transnational; you need to provide information to them in a defined standardized format on a regular basis. This drives the need to put in place processes to repeat this operation and seriously look at how these processes can be automated as much as possible.  One solution is the Blockchain, which can provide a means of cost-effectively producing and sharing this information to regulators while reducing the burden of “report exhaustion” many organizations find themselves currently facing.The two key properties the Blockchain can address include provenance of assets and chain of custody for operations on assets.The provenance of an asset is a critical activity in most industries. An asset can be represented in digital form.However, that form needs to be unique, and have the properties of whomever created it, where and when it was created. Checks also need to be conducted to ensure the asset is genuine.Call it a “Know Your Asset” process. Without this, it is possible to place “counterfeit” assets on a Blockchain.  Chain of custody is a vital reporting element. Documenting what activities have been done by which parties when is a key requirement. Some industries are further advanced than others because of existing regulatory requirements.However, the direction of travel is to implement this across all industries to provide a distributed tamper proof ledger of activities performed on digital assets.  All of this relies on identity and access management standards, which are currently being worked upon by most government bodies. Universal standards are yet to evolve.  However, in a permissioned private Blockchain, these standards can be set and achieved.  The Blockchain, with its global reach, immutability and enforcement of such key protocols as no double spend of an asset enables an auditable, real time record designed to be inspected by a regulator no matter where on the planet they physically reside.  The cost advantage for businesses is that the reports then become the domain of the regulators. The meta data provided about the assets and processes are baked into business as usual and enable ever-increasing automation as part of any business process.  After all, when was the last time a regulator removed a regulatory reporting rule?  You may wonder, what is the missing piece to this approach?  The answer is acceptance of the Blockchain by regulators as an automated reporting platform and the adoption of global standards.Considering the entire process of reporting to regulators is due for a major overhaul, Blockchain can prove essential in providing a mutually beneficial solution for all parties, including US taxpayers.- By Stephen HolmesStephen Holmes is Vice President of VirtusaPolaris‘ FinTech Lab, where he investigates the application of core technologies in solving current digital banking challenges, including Blockchain technologies and smart contracts.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Government    #Taxes  
India Completes Draft Proposal for Cryptocurrency Regulations,Joshua Althauser,8/11/2017 12:48,15218,221,"The government of India has already finalized as of early August 2017 the draft proposal recommending how to regulate the use of digital currencies in the country effectively.The plan was already submitted by the intergovernmental panel that was formed in April 2017 for said purpose to the Indian Ministry of Finance.The contents of the draft proposal are relatively unknown, but based on previous reports, some of the members of the panel favor the imposition of a stricter regulation against the use of the digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin in the country.Others, meanwhile, have proposed that the Indian government should introduce some kind of a tax policy for the cryptocurrencies.Before the creation of the panel to study the existing framework for virtual currencies in India, startup companies involved with Bitcoin or the Blockchain technology have appealed to the government to adopt a more inclusive stance for the digital currencies.They also urged the government to clarify the exact legal status of the technology and the virtual currencies in order to enlighten the majority of consumers who are still confused on the issue.Meanwhile, the Indian government has continued to advance initiatives to study the regulatory environment for Blockchain and the cryptocurrencies.Among these programs is the creation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) of a broad advisory committee that will conduct research on Blockchain and other technologies.According to SEBI, the goal of the project is to determine whether the technology can be integrated into its own regulatory processes.Part of the SEBI statement reads:""[The committee will assess] technological solutions for regulatory functions of SEBI viz. information management and data mining, risk management including cyber security, intermediary supervision, consumer protection, etc. through application of new technological solutions like application of distributed ledger technology, big data, data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine Learning etc.""",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Security  
ICO Regulations: Lack of Concern Could Lead to SEC Exchange Fines,William Suberg,8/8/2017 15:52,6709,125,"Major cryptocurrency exchanges could fall victim to US regulators for failing to register in order to offer ICO tokens.That is according to a source speaking to the New York Times as the ICO market continues to expand in light of recent comments by the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).“I’m sad to say that I think we will see one or more exchanges get hit by a fairly significant S.E.C. enforcement,” Emma Channing, general counsel at Argon Group told the publication.Argon is specifically geared to help ICO startups raise capital, and with significant exposure to any regulatory decisions, Channing is notably more on edge than others who have responded to last month’s SEC report.“The broader detail and the silences in the report should give many people pause and that doesn’t seem to have happened yet,” she said. “I don’t understand why everyone isn’t as concerned as I am.”The US organization indicated any exchange serving tokens to US customers should be registered. As none are, the implication is that even the most well-known exchanges could soon face consequences and prices could suffer due to lack of liquidity.The mood at Argon is notably more nervous than that of industry startups such as KICKICO. An ICO hosting and outsourcing platform, it is confident regulatory shifts will not serve to unravel the industry, including its own forthcoming token sale.Disclaimer.

Australian Central Bank Should Adopt Bitcoin: Bipartisan Senate Campaign,William Suberg,8/8/2017 14:10,14160,342,"Two Australian senators have moved to ask the country’s central bank to adopt Bitcoin in a “revolutionary leap.”Multiple sources report Tuesday how Senators Sam Dastyari and Jane Hume abandoned party politics to join forces on the issue of the Australia’s future financial services industry.“This will be a revolutionary leap for the Reserve Bank and for Australian financial institutions,” Dastyari said quoted by local news source the Sydney Morning Herald.“What we want to do here in Parliament is to create the political environment to allow that leap to occur.”The push marks a departure for Australia’s hitherto somewhat stale approach to cryptocurrency implementation at state level, in contrast to its stance on Blockchain.Similar to senator Mick Mulvaney’s bipartisan Bitcoin Caucus at the US Congress, Dastyari and Hume envisage multiple benefits for increased state participation, beginning it would seem with education.“I don't get what the issue is, don't they just melt all the coin bits they don't use?” Dastyari said was the response of a colleague after speaking about Bitcoin.If successful, Australian efforts could see a swing towards the kind of attitude adopted to cryptocurrency by the state in jurisdictions such as Switzerland. There, citizens are already able to use Bitcoin to perform a variety of municipal duties.""We can't compete with our Asian neighbors when it comes to producing cheap goods and services anymore. We can compete when it comes to financial services, but that is going to mean big, bold decisions,” Dastyari continued.Financial services is now Australia’s biggest industry, worth around $145 bln a year.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia  
India’s Finance Ministry Panel Recommends Government Discourage Use of Digital Currencies,Joshua Althauser,8/7/2017 8:20,18053,268,"The multi-ministerial panel created by India’s Finance Ministry has reportedly recommended that the government take urgent steps to discontinue or discourage the use of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin in the country. The panel also proposed that the government should regulate any commercial establishments and intermediaries if they continue using the digital currencies.This would put a great onus on such businesses and likely force them to stop accepting cryptocurrencies. Before making its recommendations, the panel consulted the public, digital currency startups and other stakeholders in the market.The government of India has yet to decide on how to effectively deal with the use of digital currencies in the country. Aside from the panel, however, the government has also created a task force to study the feasibility of regulating the cryptocurrencies while certain states already plan on regulating Blockchain in the public sector.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has issued an order to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to conduct an investigation on the complaints about its lack of action about virtual currencies. The central bank was given four weeks to issue a report on the matter.The use of digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, continues to grow rapidly across India. According to Bangalore-based Bitcoin exchange Unocoin, there were more than 50 new merchants who had accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment in July 2017 alone.Meanwhile, a recent survey showed that professionals in the majority of industries have already heard about Bitcoin but had not actually used it.Given these developments, it will be interesting to see if the Indian government follows the panel’s recommendation. If they do, it remains to be seen how this will affect the adoption of cryptocurrencies in India.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Government    #Digital Currency    #Markets    #Reserve Bank of India    #Unocoin    #Bitcoin Adoption  
"Singapore Clarifies ICO Token Regulation, Follows US",William Suberg,8/2/2017 16:35,11006,218,"Singapore’s financial regulator has joined the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in clarifying its stance on DAO and ICO tokens.In a circular issued Tuesday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) stated tokens would fall under its jurisdiction if they “constitute products regulated under the Securities and Futures Act.”“The types of digital tokens offered in Singapore and elsewhere vary widely,” the note finds.“Some offers may be subject to the SFA while others may not be. All issuers of digital tokens, intermediaries facilitating or advising on an offer of digital tokens and platforms facilitating trading in digital tokens should, therefore, seek independent legal advice to ensure they comply with all applicable laws and consult MAS where appropriate.”The tone taken in Singapore broadly echoes that in the US, with the SEC also stating it would use a case-by-case method of assessing the identity of a newly-issued token offered for US consumers.“In addition, platforms facilitating secondary trading of such tokens would also have to be approved or recognized by MAS as an approved exchange or recognised market operator respectively under the SFA,” the MAS’ rules continue.Addy Crezee, CEO at Cointelegraph Events, organizing BlockShow Asia 2017 powered by Cointelegraph in Singapore, says that after the SEC statement had been published, a lot of discussions arose.However, he notes:“The statement itself does not reveal anything new: just like before it, they will continue to consider ICOs case by case; and companies running ICO campaigns will have to be honest and straight in dealings with their investors and should not deceive anyone, especially citizens of the United States and Singapore. For honest people with good ideas, nothing has really changed. It’s just that Singapore can not remain silent as they have already taken many steps to implement Blockchain technology and, of course, they are exploring the market.”While not striking an unexpected note, reactions to the clarification were mixed, with attorney Marco Santori suggesting it meant Singapore was not as liberal an environment for innovative offerings as many thought.Turns out Singapore is no ""crypto haven"" after all.

India: Bitcoin Prices Drop As Media Misinterprets Govt’s Regulation Speech,William Suberg,2/1/2018 11:39,171696,1616,"Bitcoin markets are reacting to fresh regulatory comments on crypto from India’s finance minister Arun Jaitley, made during his most recent budget speech in the Parliament today, Feb.1.After Jaitley noted in his speech that cryptocurrency is not legal tender in the country and promised a crackdown on “illegitimate activities” involving crypto, a flood of misinterpreted comments warning of an outright ban appeared across the mainstream press and social media.Markets in turn fell in trading on Thursday, Bitcoin dipping below $9,512 after breaking $10,300 Wednesday, Jan. 31, data from Bitstamp shows.India has been sporadic in its attempts to formalize cryptocurrency regulation over the past two years. Since the country’s currency reforms, interest in Bitcoin especially has skyrocketed, with local exchanges reporting huge growth.At the same time, India’s central bank has issued repeated warnings on cryptocurrency investment, some of which appeared tantamount to calling it illegal.During his budget speech today, Jaitley stated:“The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.”While Jaitley’s speech noticeably avoided any mention of legality of crypto in and of itself, commentaries by third parties and mainstream media journalists controversially claimed that a ban was imminent.“Arun Jaitley has just killed India’s cryptocurrency party,” Quartz’s article on the subject proclaims, citing a lawyer who expects “a legislative mechanism or... suitable amendment in existing legislation to ensure that dealing and trading in cryptocurrency is made illegal and to penalise entities and individuals who are involved in their trade and circulation.”On Twitter, the curious reading of Jaitley’s words continued, with declarations of Bitcoin being “illegal” and soon to be “eliminated.”Cryptocurrencies are illegal.

Authorities have recently made known a desire to slowly reduce participation in Bitcoin mining, while regulators are also moving to eradicate the last traces of centralized crypto-to-fiat trading.P2P Nodes also represents an apparent U-turn for Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who in December declared that the world was “not ready” for engagement with cryptocurrency.In an interview with CNBC around the same time, Ma revealed that Alibaba had “spent a lot of efforts” researching Blockchain technology, but that Bitcoin is “not for [him]”.Cryptocurrency markets continue to feel the pressure in part from China’s latest regulatory moves, with Bitcoin losing almost 15% and altcoins much more in the past 24 hours’ trading.",16,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Mining    #Alibaba    #China    #CNBC  
BREAKING: Russia Issuing ‘CryptoRuble’,Jon Buck,10/15/2017 15:01,161705,6226,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially stated that Russia will issue its own ‘CryptoRuble’ at a closed door meeting in Moscow, according to local news sources. The news broke through Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov.According to the official, the state issued cryptocurrency cannot be mined and will be issued and controlled and maintained only by the authorities. The CryptoRubles can be exchanged for regular Rubles at any time, though if the holder is unable to explain where the CryptoRubles came from, a 13 percent tax will be levied. The same tax will be applied to any earned difference between the price of the purchase of the token and the price of the sale. Nikiforov said:“I confidently declare that we run CryptoRuble for one simple reason: if we do not, then after 2 months our neighbors in the EurAsEC will.”While the announcement means that Russia will enter the cryptocurrency world, it is in no way an affirmation or legalization of Bitcoin or any other decentralized cryptocurrency. On the contrary, Putin quite recently called for a complete ban on all cryptocurrencies within Russia.The statement from Putin seemed apparently to contradict the earlier comments from other ministers who seemed pro-crypto, but only with regulations, as well as Putin’s recent meetings with Buterin and others. Now, with the issuance of the CryptoRuble, the apparent contradiction has been made clear.",75,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Vitalik Buterin    #Banned Bitcoin    #Putin  
Metropolitan Bank Halts All Cryptocurrency-Related Wire Transfers,Jon Buck,1/14/2018 17:37,144685,1128,"In a move that will have far-reaching implications, Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp has halted all cryptocurrency related wire transfers, effective immediately, per a report from Fortune. The information came from statements by Metropolitan customers who were informed that the bank would be “ceasing all international crypto-related wire transfers.”The decision is highly significant for the cryptocurrency industry. Metropolitan Bank has earned a reputation for being Bitcoin-friendly, according to Fortune, which will likely impact its stock price.For example, Metropolitan is reportedly one of the main service providers for US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.The bank’s official position has not yet been made clear, but it appears that the risk of inability of verification for international cryptocurrency transactions has led to the move. The need to meet Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations has increased the potential for increased regulation in the currently loose cryptocurrency climate.Friday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that an international effort to control and manage transfers in cryptocurrency could be forthcoming.",27,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies  
"JPMorgan CEO Makes Unclear Statements On Bitcoin and Government, Suddenly Likes Blockchain",Olivia Capozzalo,1/9/2018 15:12,143687,1357," Today, Jan. 9. the Chairman & CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, spoke ambiguously about cryptocurrency, noting he regretted calling Bitcoin a “fraud” earlier, and was not particularly interested in the subject. He made his comments in an exclusive interview with Fox Business at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco.In September 2017 at a banking conference, Dimon called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" and said that he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded Bitcoin on the company’s accounts, in part for being “stupid”.He also told Fox Business today that he “regrets” making the September comments, but is “not interested that much in the subject at all.”However, despite his lack of interest, Dimon made an ambiguous statement about the government’s relationship to Bitcoin, telling Fox Business:“The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people.”Though it is unclear exactly what Dimon intended to say with these words, in the context of his earlier comments on the subject from 2015, he may have meant that cryptocurrency would eventually become fully government-controlled.In 2015, responding to a question about the potential for a decentralized “shadow economy” of cryptocurrencies, Dimon stated more clearly:“It’s just not gonna happen, you’re wasting your time. This is my personal opinion. There will be no real non-controlled currency in the world. There’s no government that’s gonna put up with it for long.”During the Jan. 9 interview with Fox, Dimon asserted, as he did in 2015, that the viable digital currencies will be those that are government-backed, or fiat, such as a digital yen or dollar:“You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO's you have to look at individually.”Dimon seemed optimistic about Blockchain technology, noting:“The blockchain is real.”In 2017, multiple governments around the world announced that they were considering implementing a national digital currency. Others, such as Venezuela, have already done so.An earlier version of this article implied that Dimon's 2015 statements were in fact made Jan. 9, 2018. The text has been edited to clarify timing.

Canada: TD Bank Bans Credit Card Purchases of Crypto Following Global Trend,Helen Partz,2/24/2018 22:05,139623,428,"Following in the footsteps of several major banks globally, the Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), one of the largest banks in North America, announced  in an email statement to customers on Friday, Feb. 23, that it is banning the purchase of cryptocurrency with credit cards, local journal The Globe and Mail reports.A representative of TD, the first major Canadian bank to enact such a ban, said that the bank regularly evaluates its policies and security measures “in order to serve and protect our customers, as well as the bank.”TD’s move is part of a larger global trend of banks banning customers from credit card purchases of cryptocurrency. The wave of bans was initiated by US giants J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup on Feb. 3, and followed by the largest bank in the UK, Lloyds Banking Group, Feb. 5, and Virgin Money in Australia, South Africa, and the UK on Feb. 6. Last week, Citibank India went ahead with banning both credit and debit cards for crypto purchases.According to The Globe and Mail on Feb. 23, the Royal Bank of Canada made of point of stating that it does allow both debit and credit card purchases of cryptocurrency, but it warns its customers about high volatility risks which ""could expose them to substantially higher debt levels than they are able to repay.”In a contrasting move for the local industry, on Feb. 13, a Canadian stock exchange announced that it will soon launch its own Blockchain-based securities clearing and settlement platform that help companies raise funds via fully regulated security tokens issued by the exchange.",19,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Credit Cards    #Banks    #Canada    #Cryptocurrencies

South Korea Clarifies Position on Crypto Regulation Amidst Confusion in Mainstream Media,William Suberg,1/15/2018 14:55,132811,359,"Stricter regulations for South Korea’s cryptocurrency trading industry were announced Sunday, Jan. 14, amidst continued confusion in mainstream media about a proposed ban on cryptocurrency trading by the country’s Justice Minister last week.Reports in local news agency Yonhap claimed Sunday, Jan. 14, that requirements for Korean traders to use their real names for cryptocurrency trading accounts, a potential regulation reported earlier in January, will indeed come into effect by the end of this month, citing “the authorities.”Yonhap reports that fines will also be imposed for those who do not comply with the new regulations, though the fine amount has yet to be determined.Yonhap quotes today’s government statement as saying:“The proposed shutdown of exchanges that the justice minister recently mentioned is one of the measures suggested by the justice ministry to curb speculation.A governmentwide decision will be made in the future after sufficient consultation and coordination of opinions.”The publication added:“Monday's announcement suggests that a shutdown is not likely in the near future.”The turbulent regulatory landscape in South Korea has resulted in fragmented information appearing on a daily basis as to how cryptocurrency will ultimately fare under Seoul’s jurisdiction.In the latest news from Monday, Jan. 15, an official statement from the Office for Government Policy Coordination was released stating that a ban on cryptocurrency is not in the works and that the government has yet to come to a final decision.On Jan. 11, Justice Minister Park Sang-ki proposed banning crypto trading in a press conference. The subsequent misinterpretation of his comments in mainstream media caused confusion on social media, which was repeatedly corrected by local correspondents and traders on Twitter.Nevertheless, the FUD -- Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt -- caused by the Minister’s comments and the misleading reporting on them evidently led to a cryptocurrency sell-off that same day.Public sentiment on the ground suggests a genuine consensus to keep trading open and accessible, with last week’s petition to reject a ban on cryptocurrency trading gathering over 150,000 signatures by press time. If the petition reaches 200,000 signatures by Jan. 27, it will compel a government response, the Wall Street Journal reports.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Wall Street    #Tradings  
Harvard Professors Predict Bitcoin Collapse Due to Government Regulation,Jon Buck,1/9/2018 3:45,122923,901,"According to some Harvard economics professors, Bitcoin will eventually be destroyed through the weight of government regulation. Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff believes that the risk of financial anonymity will eventually create an environment where regulation would crush Bitcoin. He said:“Small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies…would be desirable but large-scale anonymous payments would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.”The perspective is shared, though in a different vein, by the counterpart, Jeffrey A. Miron, whose Libertarian perspective makes him more lassez-faire. Nevertheless, he believes that central governments will eventually drive the technology out of existence. He said:“It [government] could let cryptocurrencies peacefully exist, and not accept them as a means of payment, and that’s what I think it should do. But my guess is that sooner or later governments are going to regulate cryptocurrencies out of existence.”The potential for government regulation is certainly real, as multiple nations have limited access to or exchange of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. China famously banned ICOs (initial coin offerings) and has restricted Bitcoin exchange access.It should also, of course, be remembered that Bitcoin is by no means anonymous. Users routinely make mistakes which weaken or eliminate Bitcoin’s psuedo-anonymity. As Cointelegraph has previously reported, the IRS has engaged the services of Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to help them tax cheats who don’t report their Bitcoin profits.",60,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government  
"Suddenly, Bitcoin to Be Officially Legal in India",Joseph Young,6/20/2017 18:55,119632,0,"CNBC India has revealed that the Indian government committee has ruled in favor of regulating Bitcoin.On April 14, Cointelegraph reported that the Inter-Disciplinary Committee within India’s Ministry of Finance was actively investigating the legal status of Bitcoin and considering the possibility of regulating the market.Over the past three years, the big three Indian Bitcoin exchanges including Zebpay, Coinsecure and Unocoin operated with self-regulated trading platforms with strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering systems in place, despite the lack of regulations in the digital currency industry and market.The efforts of the Bitcoin exchanges in India to self-regulate the market allowed the Indian government to reconsider the Bitcoin and digital currency sectors, regardless of the criticisms by several politicians that significantly lack knowledge in cryptocurrency.On March 24, Cointelegraph reported that Kirit Somaiya, a member of parliament of the ruling BJP in India, was harshly criticized for his description of Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme.In a letter to the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India, Somaiya explained that Bitcoin is a pyramid Ponzi-type scheme. However, Somaiya was criticized for his inability to understand the structural and fundamental difference between a Ponzi scheme and Bitcoin.In spite of the negative attitude of certain politicians, the Indian government has come to a decision to regulate the market and provide an even playing field for Bitcoin exchanges that have allocated a significant amount of resources to standardize the market and industry.Back in April, Mohit Kalra, CEO of Coinsecure, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in India, told Cointelegraph in an interview that the Indian government has finally started to take Bitcoin seriously and are considering the possibility of regulating the market.Kalra said:“Finally, something positive for the industry. Authorities are now taking this technology seriously. We have been trying to get their attention for years now. I am glad it's all happening at the right time. At Coinsecure, we are seeing a massive increase in the number of users and volumes. We are positive with what will happen in these coming three months.”On June 20, CNBC India announced that the Indian government committee has ruled in favor of regulating Bitcoin and is currently establishing a task force to create various regulatory frameworks with the aim of fully legalizing Bitcoin in the short-term.Prior to the announcement of the Indian government, Chris Burniske, ARK Invest’s crypto lead, noted that the trading volumes in India have been on the rise.

The report states:“The amount of observed Bitcoin laundering [is] small and darknet marketplaces such as Silk Road and, later, AlphaBay are [generally] the source of almost all of the illicit Bitcoins laundered through conversion services.”The report also indicates that the vast majority of illicit transactions using Bitcoin were processed in Europe, receiving more than five times as many illicit transactions as North America.The report suggests that the best way to combat such illicit activity is through more stringent anti-money laundering (AML) measures.

This security breach, along with several other breaches of South Korean exchanges, has recently been more definitively linked to North Korean hackers.The South Korean government has recently been stepping up enforcement of cryptocurrency regulation within the country. Besides ordering the financial probe, the government has banned the use of anonymous virtual accounts, frozen the opening of new virtual accounts, and forbid underage and foreign users from trading on exchanges.The South Korean public has fought back with a petition to stop the recent government regulations.

Green Light for Crypto: Market Gets Back on Its Feet,Darryn Pollock,1/18/2018 12:44,103243,622,"For the umpteenth time, Bitcoin was declared dead this week as the cryptocurrency market took a major dive in value. Bitcoin dipped below $10,000 as others followed suit with even bigger drops as the panic spread about a burst bubble.However, the negative charts across the board took a positive turn as most of the numbers turned green across the major coins. The crypto market has generally been in a downturn since Bitcoin hit the $20,000 mark, but this recent collapse ignited genuine fear and panic.As the adage goes, a rising tide floats all boats, and conversely, the same happens when the tide drains. In other words, when Bitcoin is up, many coins follow, but as it has been in the last week, the entire cryptomarket took a hit as Bitcoin led the way in loss of value.In fact, most of the top 10 cryptos, and the more established and well-known ones fell harder than Bitcoin, leaving nowhere for digital currency investors to flee - other than out.There was a large outflow of money from the cryptocurrency market in these recent days, with the global cryptocurrency market cap dropping from over $700 bln to $400 bln.It was rounded out that Bitcoin’s fall - from about $14,000 to just under $10,000 equated to a 30 percent swing, which, looking back in history is relatively normal and expected.Bitcoin faced three similar, if not bigger drops in 2017:While not out of the woods yet, the crypto market definitely looked a lot more optimistic as the floor seemed to be reached and green numbers were showing a turn in fortunes.The reasoning behind the most recent crash can, to a large part, be put down to the confusion that has been coming from Korea on alleged plans to ban cryptocurrencies in the booming Asian market.The country’s citizens spoke out recently about these rumors, making their position known with a petition containing 200,000 signatures, demanding the government respond.",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Banned Bitcoin    #Cryptocurrencies    #Markets

Notably, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb also supports “the right set of regulations”.Worried about a ‘cryptocurrency obsession’ in the country, the South Korean government started considering a range of regulatory measures for crypto.Some of the proposed regulations include banning anonymous virtual trading accounts, forbidding underaged investors and foreigners from investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the Korean market, and even banning cryptocurrency trading outright.Cryptocurrency investing has become especially popular among South Korean youth since the country’s economic situation is notably hard for the young population. According to Quartz, the youth unemployment hit an all-time high rate of 12.5% in February 2017, compared to the average overall unemployment rate of 4.2%.Overall, the stance of the South Korean government towards cryptocurrency regulation has been contradictory during the last month, made particularly confusing by the Justice Minister’s informal proposal of a cryptocurrency trading ban, which was then widely misreported by mainstream media.",32,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
Is Global Front on Bitcoin Regulation Possible?,Darryn Pollock,1/16/2018 19:36,101783,550,"On a day where confusing news continues to emanate from South Korea and China on new proposed bans and restrictions on Bitcoin, a member of the board of Germany’s Bundesbank has called for a united global regulatory front.Joachim Wuermeling of Bundesbank believes there is very little chance of containing this digital global phenomenon with differing national rules across the globe. With international co-operation in regulating Bitcoin comes a chance for regulators to take control, says Wuermeling.There has been increased regulatory pressure on Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market recently, which has been felt across the board. The confusion that began in Korea caused a major dip, and even the retraction of those statements helped the market grow.Within these regulatory moves, from individual national countries, there are often powerful moves seen across the entire global cryptocurrency market. However, they are never really big enough to bring it under full control.These are case-by-case regulations, and these instances are not strong enough on their own for the free running cryptomarket to be constrained by.“Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited,” Wuermeling said.The issue is that there are two very different views to regulating Bitcoin, and these views can differ from country to country.Japan is one of the strongest supporters of the digital currency market, giving Bitcoin currency status last year. However, just across the Sea of Japan, on the mainland, China has been the lead actor in the war against Bitcoin.First there was the ICO ban, then the ban on exchanges, and now there is more bad news for those who even deal in exchange-like services.It is hard to find an agreeable position on digital currencies for nations with so many torn between different ends of the scale. This is one of the reasons why regulation is so difficult.There is also the discussion of the need for regulation as it seemingly flies in the face of what Bitcoin is trying to accomplish with its decentralized nature. Cal Evans, an International Technology Lawyer from London, says:“As the cryptocurrency “grows up” it has had to overcome some serious compliance and regulatory problems internationally. These regulatory issues are numerous in nature depending on which country you read this in. Yet one problem seems to slip under the radar time and time again. Money Laundering.”Adding to the devious nature, an unregulated currency brings London’s Kingston University economics professor Steve Keen echoes similar sentiments.“You can’t be deregulated in a system where there will be criminal attacks. The code itself is clearly not foolproof. People will find their way in, forks will be forced upon them, whether they want them or not. In that situation, regulation may be the only future.”It is clear that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to exist in ways that many regulators disapprove of unless there is a united front on wresting the digital currency economy under global control.Even banning the stuff in countries in China has only proved to be a speed bump in the road, Bitcoiners, and the likes can always find a way.",28,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Central Bank    #Germany    #South Korea    #China  
How Chinese Bitcoin Buyers Are Getting Around Government Ban,Joseph Young,1/27/2018 7:11,95570,1054,"Chinese citizens are still investing in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market despite the government’s heavy crackdown.In September 2017, Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin were ordered by the government to shut down their businesses. At one point, executives of the three cryptocurrency exchanges were prevented from leaving the country, due to a government investigation into local cryptocurrency exchanges.Three months later, in December of 2017, China’s three largest cryptocurrency exchanges relocated their businesses to Hong Kong. BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin rebranded to BTCC, Huobi Pro and OKEx, respectively. They intended to address the rapidly growing demand from Hong Kong-based investors.Shortly after their move, the three trading platforms started to see daily volumes from Chinese investors grow exponentially. Somehow, Chinese investors were managing to circumvent Chinese trading restrictions by using Hong Kong-based exchanges. How is this possible?In Hong Kong, it is relatively easy for investors to set up businesses. With less than $1,000, businesses can be legally created, which allows the opening of business bank accounts at Hong Kong-based financial institutions. Beginning in December 2017, many Chinese investors moved their funds from their Chinese bank accounts to Hong Kong bank accounts and started to trade cryptocurrencies more actively, effectively bypassing China’s restrictions.But, unlike China, Hong Kong has a substantially lower supply to meet the growing demand. While China is home to major miners like Bitmain, Hong Kong does not produce much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As such, premiums in the Hong Kong cryptocurrency market increased, surpassing even that of the South Korean market. On January 18, when the global average price of Bitcoin was around $11,500, Bitcoin was being traded at above $13,000 on Huobi Pro.Krystal Hu, a Hong Kong-based finance journalist, noted that traders outside of China have also started to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity presented by the Hong Kong market. For instance, on January 18, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase was $11,800. Purchasing Bitcoin from Coinbase and selling it on any Hong Kong-based market would have generated $1,200 in profit.Hong Kong’s exchanges have also integrated widely-used fintech applications in China such as Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay. Alipay is a $60 billion fintech app that is used by more than 50 percent of mobile users. WeChat Pay, which was only used by seven percent of mobile users in 2014, is now being used by more than 40 percent of mobile users in China.The integration of the two fintech payment networks has increased the accessibility of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency OTC exchanges for Chinese investors, easing the process of investing in the cryptocurrency market.To prevent Chinese investors from buying digital currencies, the Chinese government and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), have asked local banks to disclose any suspicious transactions linked to Hong Kong-based markets. However, even this action will not be able to prevent Chinese investors from accessing Hong Kong-based markets, due to apps such as Alipay and WeChat Pay.",57,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Huobi    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Tradings  
New Report: Bitcoin Drug Money Laundering Is Highly Centralized,Jon Buck,1/16/2018 3:35,91476,403,"A joint report by Center on Sanctions & Illicit Finance and Elliptic, a cryptocurrency forensics firm, has indicated that Bitcoin laundering for illicit drug activity is a highly centralized process. The report’s authors, Yaya Fanusi and Tom Robinson, indicate that much of illicit Bitcoin is laundered through mixers, saying:“Mixers have consistently processed about a quarter of incoming illicit Bitcoins per year. The proportion laundered through exchanges and gambling combined has been roughly constant (66 to 72 percent). Of note, Bitcoin exchanges processed 45 percent of laundered Bitcoins, but, as they received much higher volumes, a much lower proportion of their activity is illicit.”The report also indicated that the vast bulk of those mixer and gambling laundering schemes occur through just three sites. In fact, the report indicates that “97 percent of the volume in their categories and 50 percent of the volume overall” is processed by these few sites.Metropolitan Bank recently ceased wire transfers for cryptocurrencies, due to the increasing risk of money laundering and other illicit activities being conducted through Bitcoin. At the same time, China has sought to close ‘exchange-like’ sites for Bitcoin, believing greater regulation and control are critical.",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Germany    #Russia    #China  
Bitcoin To Become ‘Just Like Money’ In Australia July 1,William Suberg,5/10/2017 12:53,88242,9318,"Australia has officially confirmed it will treat Bitcoin “just like money” from this year and it will no longer be subject to double taxation.In its budget summary for 2017-18, the government states that as part of its plan to “make it easier” for digital currency businesses to operate in the country. It will ensure that nowhere in the supply chain is general sales tax (GST) paid more than once.“The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia,” the summary reads.“From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes. Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.”Australia has had a troubled relationship with cryptocurrency regulation until recently. The decision to allow double taxation originally caused several well-known operators to quit the country back in 2014, while innovation has subsequently lagged behind markets in which businesses have enjoyed greater freedom.Innovative fintech deals involving Blockchain have surfaced this year, however, and the tone of the budget extract points to a desire to change Australia’s environment.“Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia,” it continues.“The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (FinTech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.”Meanwhile, local business optimism is also increasing.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia  
"Blink And You’ll Miss It: US, UK Officials Both Say They’re ‘Looking At’ Crypto",William Suberg,1/25/2018 16:30,87736,341,"Government officials from the US and UK have said they are “looking at” cryptocurrency this week as the topic gains considerable focus at the ongoing World Economic Forum 2018.Speaking separately at the annual event, US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and UK prime minister Theresa May both said that “illicit” or “criminal” use of Bitcoin was cause for ensuring appropriate regulation.“My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities,” Mnuchin told CNBC.“So in the U.S., our regulations (state that) if you're a bitcoin wallet you're subject to the same regulations as a bank.”Theresa May meanwhile echoed the need to ensure Bitcoin had only bonafide uses in the UK as it prepares to leave the European Union with only limited regulation in place surrounding cryptocurrency.“In areas like cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously, precisely because of the way they can be used, particularly by criminals,” May said in an interview with Bloomberg.“It is something that has been developing… I think it’s something that we do need to look at.”As Cointelegraph reveals insights into cryptocurrency from the world’s leaders at Davos, in the US, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton co-authored an article in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Jan. 24.Clayton’s piece is dedicated to so-called ‘distributed ledger technology’ and how its regulatory future should look. Echoing May and Mnuchin, SEC chairman has reiterated the need for strict oversight of the “offer, sale and trading” of cryptocurrencies:“The SEC will vigorously pursue those [cryptocurrencies] who seek to evade the registration, disclosure and antifraud requirements of our securities laws,” he wrote in the WSJ.“If history is any guide, DLT is likely to be followed by many more life-changing innovations.

"Central Bank of Indonesia Warns Against All Cryptocurrency Use, Cites High Risk",Molly Jane Zuckerman,1/14/2018 12:25,87104,665,"Bank Indonesia issued a press release on Jan. 13, warning its citizens against the use of selling, buying or trading cryptocurrency and reiterating that virtual currency is not legitimate within Indonesia.This statement comes after the September reassertion that Bank Indonesia will not accept Bitcoin (BTC) as payment, leading to the voluntary closure of two Indonesian-based crypto exchanges, BitBayar and TokoBitcoin. Bank Indonesia cites concerns over potential use in money laundering and funding terrorism as reasons behind their anti-cryptocurrency campaign:“Virtual currencies are vulnerable to bubble risks and susceptible to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing, therefore can potentially impact financial system stability and cause financial harm to society.”While there is no official ban on Bitcoin within the country, per Wikipedia, the press release forbidding all activity relating to cryptocurrency takes a harsher tone than previous statements that merely advised citizens to be careful around Bitcoin.Algeria’s government has also taken steps towards a crypto ban, with reports that the 2018 Finance Bill will make Bitcoin ownership and trading illegal within the country.

"Bitfinex, Tether Get Subpoenas From US Regulators",William Suberg,1/30/2018 19:35,82118,546,"Update: Nathaniel Popper, a reporter from New York Times, has claimed in a tweet that the subpoenas were delivered on Dec. 6 and not last week, according to ‘source familiar with the matter.’Major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and token issuer Tether have received subpoenas from US regulators as questions continue to arise about the latter’s ‘true’ value.As Bloomberg reports Tuesday, Jan. 30 quoting sources who opted to remain anonymous, Tether’s notional USD peg has come under increasing suspicion, with authorities “routinely” querying its legal providence.“We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations,” the publication quotes emailed statements from Bitfinex and Tether sent this week. “It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.”Controversy has swelled around Tether, whose chief executive officer Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is also the CEO of Bitfinex, after volatility and rumors of Bitcoin price manipulation surfaced late last year.While it remains unclear as to what specifically triggered the subpoenas, which both companies received last week, the move comes as less of a surprise amid the flurry of suspicion surrounding them on social media in January.In reactions following the news, cryptocurrency industry commentators had mixed opinions.WhalePanda, who has become known for his trading and business-related tweets, noted the lack of connection between Bitfinex, Tether and US authorities.I'm a clueless idiot but what does the CTFC have to do with Bitfinex (not US company), Tether (not US company) and the fact that Bitfinex doesn't allow any US customers on their platform. Although it might be from before that they enforced that rule.Meanwhile, Bitcoin prices have taken a plunge on Tuesday, likely caused in part by the news. Charlie Shrem considered those selling off Bitcoin to be “truly stupid,” as Tether holdings presented the risk and cryptocurrency presented a “way out” of any financial losses.Panic sellers of #bitcoin are truly stupid. Think about it, if you are holding Tether, the only way out would be to *buy* crypto with it. https://t.co/15NBl7IeP7As of press time Tuesday, Tether was trading at an average of $0.998, just below parity, with prices having swung as high as $1.05 in the last month.Bitcoin fell an average of 11% according to data from Coinmarketcap.",15,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitfinex    #USA    #CoinMarketCap  
Chinese Might be Able to Trade Bitcoin Again Soon,Alex Gao,10/29/2017 13:40,80279,3925,"19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the most important conference in China this year, ended on Oct. 24. With the end of the conference, some temporary regulations and policies are canceled as well. Among the regulations, the shutdown of Bitcoin trading in China might be one.On Oct. 28 ZB.com, which is a new cryptocurrency trading platform, announced that all trading functionality will be available from Nov. 1. Users can sign up for accounts and deposit now.The platform claims that people all over the world, including those in mainland China, can exchange and trade on the platform. The languages of the website are Chinese and English. However, it’s too soon to state that the regulation toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is invalid. Maybe the platform will be closed by the government soon. Nevertheless, there are also people saying that the Chinese government is behind the platform.For now, nobody knows exactly what’s going to happen after Nov. 1. It's good news if Chinese Bitcoin traders may operate more easily. Since the shutdown of Bitcoin trading platforms in China, people have started to trade Bitcoin through Taobao, which is the Chinese version of eBay which belongs to Alibaba Group, Wechat chatting group, and QQ chatting group.

Shark Tank’s Herjavec Thinks Bitcoin And Blockchain Are ‘Here To Stay’,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/18/2018 18:52,76586,863,"According to Shark Tank’s Robert Herjavec, Bitcoin is “here to stay” in the long term, cryptocurrency will definitely be regulated, and investors should both get in and get out now, according to an interview with financial news outlet TheStreet.While Herjavec says that he himself is not an investor in crypto, he predicts that Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise in the short term, even above the January high of 20,000:“It’ll take out that high, I’m saying it right now.”He believes that cryptocurrencies should and will be regulated, and that as firm regulation becomes closer to reality, the price of Bitcoin will continue to speculate but then drop way down. Based on this idea, while maintaining that Bitcoin is around for the long term, Herjavec tells TheStreet that “I don’t know if you want to own Bitcoin right now. I think you want to get in, and you want to get out,” a mentality that is opposed to the traditional crypto geek’s desire to “hodl,” that is hold onto your coins.Besides Shark Tank, Herjavec is the CEO of the cybersecurity firm the Herjavec Group.When asked about the security of cryptocurrencies, Herjavic doesn’t think that crypto exchanges themselves are “prone to great security,” referencing the hack of over $500 mln in NEM from the Japanese-based crypto exchange Coincheck last month, but that cryptocurrency transactions are secure.In answer to a question about the future of Blockchain, Herjavic thinks that Blockchain shows a lot of promise because of its “inherent security of a transaction.” He predicts that 10 years down the line, due to the power of Blockchain:“I will walk somewhere and a sensor will automatically know it’s me, the sensor will be linked to my bank, it’ll know how much money I have, I’ll pick up something like at the Amazon store, it’ll automatically be scanned, and as I leave, it will automatically be verified and paid for.”",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price

Tax-Free Ways to Transfer Bitcoin and Other Crypto: Expert Take,Robert W. Wood,2/17/2018 8:29,68005,611,"In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation, and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas and CV to a.mcqueen@cointelegraph.com.Despite recent corrections in crypto markets, you might have some big gains in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But taxes are an ever-present danger, and it is clear that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is looking for reporting. With all the worry about so-called 1031 tax-free exchanges that can no longer be used for cryptocurrency, are there any other ways to transfer your crypto without triggering taxes? Here are some ideas, each way has pluses and minuses.How about contributing your cryptocurrency to a corporation or partnership that you will control? In general, transferring property into a corporation in exchange for its stock is a taxable event.That is, the transaction is treated as if you sold the property to the corporation in return for cash. The difference between the stock value you received, and the tax basis in the property you transferred to the corporation, will result in a gain or loss. That means taxes. Of course, you generally don’t want this sale treatment.Fortunately, Section 351 of the tax code generally allows people to transfer property to a corporation in exchange for stock without trigger tax, even if the property is appreciated. The corporation can be either an S corporation (basically taxed as a flow-through) or a C corporation (that itself pays taxes). The corporation can be newly organized or already existing.Of course, some requirements must be met. But if you meet them, some gains on an exchange of property for stock can be delayed. The IRS can tax it later when the shareholder eventually sells the stock received in the exchange. No gain or loss is triggered as long as you receive only stock in exchange for your property and you are in control of the corporation immediately after the exchange.The control means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of outstanding shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. If you, along with others, transfer property into a corporation, you can do this as a group.  So you don’t have to have control personally.The same kind of thing can work for partnership or LLC. Contributions of property or money in exchange for partnership interest are usually non-recognition events. In a way that is similar to the rule for corporations, the contributions can be tax-free, both to the contributing partner and to the partnership.For partnerships, this non-recognition rule is contained in Section 721(a) of the Tax Code. It generally applies regardless of whether the contribution is made on the formation of the partnership or after it has been in existence and operating for some time. But there are some potential traps, more so with partnerships than with corporations. For example, this non-recognition rule does not apply to transactions between the partnership and a partner acting outside his capacity as a partner, or when the purported contribution is a disguised sale.Moreover, under Section 721(b), the no tax rule also does not apply to gain realized upon a contribution of property to a partnership “investment company,” where the contribution results in the diversification of the transferor’s assets. All of these issues that can trigger taxes can be hard to spot.You can give crypto as a gift, and it doesn’t trigger income taxes. That’s right, no income tax to you as the donor, and no income tax to the recipient. Of course, when the recipient transfers or sells it, there would be income taxes then.And at that point, the donee would need to calculate gain or loss. What is his or her tax basis, since it was a gift? The tax basis is the same as it was in your hands when you made the gift.Keep in mind that to avoid income taxes, a gift has to be really a gift. The tax law is littered with cases of people who claimed something was a gift, but who got stuck with income taxes. With gifts not being subject to income taxes, it can seem tempting to try to characterize money or property you receive as gifts. But be careful: the IRS hears this ‘it was a gift’ excuse a lot.And the IRS is unlikely to be persuaded unless you can document it. Plus, the IRS will expect a gift to occur in a normal gift-like setting. For example, if an employer or former employer gives a loyal employee $10,000 is that a gift? No, it is a bonus, treated as wages. Even trying to document it as a gift may not change that result.True gifts may not trigger any income taxes, but there could be gift taxes involved. If you give crypto to a friend or family member —to anyone really— ask how much it is worth. If the gift is worth more than $15,000, it requires you to file a gift tax return. For 2018, $15,000 is the amount of so-called “annual exclusion.” You can give gifts up to this amount each year to any number of people with no reporting required.Any gifts over that $15,000 amount require a gift tax return, even though you may not have to pay any gift tax. Rather than paying it, you normally would use up a small portion of your lifetime exclusion from gift and estate tax. For 2018, that number went up dramatically. The amount you can transfer tax-free during your life or on death just went up to $11.2 mln per person. That is $22.4 mln per married couple.What if your gift isn’t to a person, but to charity? If you give to charity, that can be very tax-smart. If you give crypto to a qualified charity, you should normally get an income tax deduction for the full fair market value of the crypto. If you bought it for $500, and donate to a 501(c)(3) charity when it is worth $15,000, you should get a $15,000 charitable contribution deduction. What’s more, you won’t have to pay the capital gain or income tax on the $14,500 spread. That’s a good deal. It’s why most savvy people, think Warren Buffett, want to donate appreciated property rather than money to charity.Remember, if you use crypto to buy something, the IRS considers that a sale of your crypto. You have to calculate gain or loss. You might have bought something with your crypto. But you made a sale in the process!The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.",14,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Taxes    #IRS  
Regulations And Their Influence On Cryptocurrency Prices,Nikolai Kuznetsov,2/24/2018 7:10,58222,568,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.2017 saw cryptocurrencies swing wildly in valuations daily. Despite a mostly upward trajectory, the market remains susceptible to unpredictable and sometimes extreme fluctuations in prices.While some of this volatility can be attributed to how the current cryptocurrency model was conceived—namely its deflationary nature—and the fact that most coins are still viewed mainly as investment and speculative assets, there have been external factors that drive price momentum as well.The increased spotlight on Bitcoin and its digital contemporaries led the original cryptocurrency to skyrocket in value. This meteoric rise results in widespread market participation, inviting retail investors in droves to the crypto industry. However, it also focused the gaze of governments and international actors on the industry, a factor that has and could still play a large role in this volatility, especially if past regulatory efforts are any indication.A prominent example of how regulations can lead to unintended consequences in financial markets comes courtesy of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the restrictions placed on deposit-taking banks, many prominent financial institutions were forced to reduce their market-making activities in certain asset classes to reach higher capital ratios required by the regulations. In effect, the reduction in market-making liquidity harmed the price discovery process. Especially in the bond market, which is not as liquid as foreign exchange or stock markets, it can conceivably result in a snowball effect that amplifies directional price movements instead of reducing overall volatility.Despite regulators’ best intentions, cryptocurrencies’ values remain heavily tied to speculation and optimism. For this reason, drastic policy changes can have an outsized impact on short-term direction, as several prominent examples revealed over the past year.Nonetheless, the long-term impact is slightly hazier, as many of these regulations are only months old. Even so, while they could lead to a more stable market in the future, an abundance of questions surrounding the matter shows just how effective regulations will really be, and to what degree they will impact prices in the future.The original boom in cryptocurrencies occurred in an unregulated environment. Even as news outlets and investors paid closer attention to the market, regulators and international actors remained largely distant from the action, and prices continued to soar unabated.While in 2017 regulatory bodies take their first steps toward reining in the market, the previous near-decade saw cryptocurrencies evolve and grow relatively unrestricted. For regulators, this means attempting to box in a system that grew chaotically mostly by design.This trend was largely visible thanks to the explosive growth in ICO funding many Blockchain companies attained last year. In 2017 new Blockchain-based companies reach an unheard-of $4 bln in funding even as regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission began to circle. The capital raising was not without its flaws, with several well-publicized incidents underlining the relative lawlessness of the current model.Hartej Sawhney - Co-founder of Hosho – a Blockchain and smart contracts auditing and security firm who’ve seen and audited a vast amount of smart contracts noted:""There is currently no regulatory body that is enforcing standard practices for companies within the Blockchain ecosystem.The number of successful high-profile attacks and data breaches are also indicative of the security weaknesses that many companies and organizations have, but choose to ignore due to lack of regulation which is a big factor to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices.Sophisticated projects within the Blockchain ecosystem will only grow a stronger support from investors and exchanges upon the rise of a regulatory environment.Having clarity on laws is better than none. Gibraltar is a great example of a nation that has made its stance on regulation of the Blockchain space clear, thus companies globally are flocking to incorporate there.""This ‘wild west’ the cryptocurrency market catalyzed has had a psychological impact on investors. Due to the decentralized nature and lack of power structures inherent in cryptocurrencies, many view regulations as a tactic that could stunt this explosive growth, and reduce the volatility that has been a hallmark of the industry.The result is a market in which news or speculation of upcoming regulation leads to massive moves in one direction or another, as investors rush to sell off coins or purchase them, creating instability in prices and wild swings in valuations. Bitcoin, for example, lost nearly half of its value as popular exchange Coinbase launched an internal investigation into fraudulent practices and potential market manipulation on their platform.More recently, prices of most cryptocurrencies dropped significantly after South Korean regulators announced they would ban crypto trading entirely, or at least implement significant controls on the market.The result was a more than 15% slide in Bitcoin, while Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and most other major cryptocurrencies lost double digits amounts in market capitalization within hours.But not all regulations result in negative shocks. After the South Korean government changed its tack and sounded a more positive note, cryptocurrencies quickly reversed their slide and generated significant upward momentum.Even before that, Japan’s public and outward embrace of cryptocurrencies helped push Bitcoin prices to then-historic highs.After falling to near $3,000 following a Chinese ban on cryptocurrencies in September, prices leapt by 96 percent to $5,855 following the news. The country’s announcement of Bitcoin’s legalization as a payment method drove a new frenzy in Asia to buy cryptocurrencies.Adv. Aviya Arika, Head of Blockchain Innovation at Porat & Co. Law Firm, who has been dealing with uncertain regulatory environments for a long while, noted:“Contrary to what your instinct may tell you, regulation actually makes cryptocurrencies prices flourish.Regulatory uncertainty, as well as outright bans by governments, have proved to be harmful to the crypto markets.When an investor/user is not sure about how they are going to be taxed when they sell their crypto, or about the mere legitimacy of their use of crypto, they will most likely steer clear of it altogether or just hodl until further notice. These behaviors lead to a bearish market.However, when regulators shed light on the way they view cryptocurrency, investors and users feel more certain regarding the way they can use crypto, whether it be as a medium of exchange, a financial instrument or any other form.Generally speaking, I think that as more jurisdictions regulate and clarify legal statuses of cryptocurrencies, crypto markets will become substantially more stable and widely adopted.”Furthermore, cryptocurrencies’ introduction into mainstream investments has proven uneven at best. When the Chicago Board Options Exchange announced it would start offering Bitcoin futures contracts, trading was halted three times in six days after prices swung too far, triggering alerts and downtime.Overall, user sentiment still outweighs cryptocurrencies’ abilities to retain value, and the divergence from real-world assets, such as gold, means that speculation and knee-jerk reactions will continue to have an outsized impact on price fluctuations.Even with the increased attention being paid to the sector, cryptocurrencies remain a mystery to many financial observers who attempt to project prices. Despite its nearly 10-year existence, the cryptocurrency industry remains very much in its infancy. Regulators have only recently started to think of ways to restrain some of the more dangerous practices that abound in the market, but have run into challenging headwinds.Most recognize that blockchain—the underlying technology that supports cryptocurrencies’ many popular features—is a vital component of the future, but regulating the broader market has so far proven to also put a damper on the blockchain sector.Moreover, ICOs remain a serious concern for governments and regulators considering their high vulnerability to fraud, theft, hacking, and other unethical practices.The sector’s young age also makes it difficult to measure the long-term impact of regulations. Even after its most violent price swings, Bitcoin prices have self-corrected, as do most other cryptocurrencies. The real effect regulations across the globe will have is becoming clearer, but the picture remains murky.2018 should be an important measuring stick as to how regulations impact the industry. In the meantime, investors need to always remain vigilant considering more and not less regulation is on the horizon, likely spurring violent reactions in the short-term while rendering long-term investment strategies a haphazard guess at best.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Bitcoin Price    #Bitcoin Adoption    #South Korea    #Japan    #ICO    #SEC  
Google To Ban All Crypto-Related Ads Starting June 2018,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/14/2018 9:49,57113,1255,"Google will ban all cryptocurrency-related advertising of all types in June 2018, according to a recent update to their Financial Services policy.The news of a crypto ad ban comes just days after crypto advertisers using Google Adwords noticed a drastic drop in the number of views of their advertisements, according to posts on the Adwords support pages. However, Google Adwords had at that time denied any change in their Financial Services regulations that would block cryptocurrency or Initial Coin Offering (ICO) related advertisements.Under Google’s newly updated financial products policy, no advertisements for “cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice),” will be accepted.The move affects all of Google's ad products, meaning companies will not be able to serve crypto-related ads on the search engine giant’s own sites, as well as third-party sites in its network.Scott Spencer, the Director of Sustainable Ads at Google, told CNBC today, March 14:""We don't have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we've seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it's an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.”Facebook had already banned crypto related advertisements in January of this year, citing the potential for “deceptive promotional practices.”Cryptocurrency advertisements have also reportedly been disappearing from Chinese social media sites amidst China’s bans of crypto exchanges and ICOs.",96,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Google    #Cryptocurrencies    #ICO    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
"Russia’s Ministry of Finance Legalizes Cryptocurrency Trading, Central Bank Disagrees",Helen Partz,1/26/2018 6:55,55565,778,"The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (Minfin) has presented the Digital Assets Regulation Bill which defines and establishes a regulatory system for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, mining and trading, local news agency TASS reported today Jan. 25.Notably, the central bank of Russia disagrees with Ministry of Finance that cryptocurrency exchange should be legally accepted. According to the central bank, the digital currency trading rules should be only applied to tokens that would attract financial investments.According to TASS, the authors of the bill are confident that the legal status of cryptocurrency would reduce the risks of fraud and provide fiscal transparency, which is expected to increase tax revenue of the government. In contrast, banning cryptocurrency trading would likely only lead to the emergence of a black market.The bill defines cryptocurrencies and tokens as digital financial assets which are not legal tender in Russia.As for cryptocurrencies and tokens exchanged for other cryptocurrencies, Russian ruble and foreign currencies, Minfin is reported to claim that it protects the funds of unqualified investors by allowing trading only via authorized cryptocurrency exchange operators.Concerning ICOs, tokens are allowed to be issued by legal entities or private operators for the purpose of fundraising. ICOs must be accompanied with legal documentation that discloses the details of the contract such as the issuer’s full name, physical location, official website and token’s price.According to the document, non-licensed investors will not be allowed to invest more than 50,000 rubles, equivalent to about $900 in each particular ICO.The final version of the bill was earlier reported to be scheduled for a release no later than July 1, 2018, according to Forklog, so the current version may still be altered until then.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Central Bank    #Tradings    #Cryptocurrencies

The license was granted to the exchange by the Luxembourg regulator, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF).BitFlyer, which entered the US market compliantly as of fall 2017, already operates in Japan under a license granted by the Financial Services Agency (FSA).Yuzo Kano, the founder and CEO of bitFlyer, said in the press release,“I am proud that we are now the most compliant virtual currency exchange in the world; this coveted regulatory status gives our customers, our company and the virtual currency industry as a whole a very positive future outlook.”While the company will initially offer only a BTC/EUR pair in the EU, other virtual currencies like Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin Cash will be added to the bitFlyer Europe platform later this year.BitFlyer traded a total of just under $300 mln in the past 24 hours to press time, currently ranking 14th by trading volume on CoinMarketCap.Countries all over the world have been struggling to decide how to regulate cryptocurrencies, from several US states introducing licenses to operate within regulatory framework, to China closing all of its crypto exchanges.Japan is one of the few countries to officially recognize Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as money, a move that has allowed major Japanese banks to be comfortable investing a large amount of money into bitFlyer.Germany’s Bundesbank has said that regulation in general, which for many is an anathema to the decentralized nature of all cryptocurrencies, will only work on a global scale.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #BitFlyer    #EU    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
Russia’s Largest State Bank To Open Cryptocurrency Exchange In Europe,Helen Partz,1/31/2018 20:36,48014,852,"Sberbank, the largest state bank of Russia, is planning to launch a cryptocurrency exchange in its Swiss branch, Sberbank Switzerland AG, local media group RBC reported on Tuesday Jan. 30.The bank’s Head of Global Markets Andrey Shemetov told RBC that the Russian bank chose Switzerland for the exchange location because Russian authorities do not currently allow cryptocurrency operations, while cryptocurrency exchange is legal in Switzerland.“We wish to serve our customers’ interests, that’s why we think that we need to have strategic access to all kinds of products and services,” Shemetov claimed.As RBC reports, Sberbank is currently developing their trading infrastructure, but Shemetov did not specify when the exchange is expected to be launched.Sberbank does not plan to provide cryptocurrency exchange to retail investors, but is looking to operate on the institutional level.  “Cryptocurrency exchange operations will be available for legal entities only,” Shemetov stated, adding that cryptocurrency investments are high risk due to market volatility.Earlier this month, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, declared that cryptocurrency should not be banned “under any circumstances”, calling both cryptocurrencies and Blockchain“new huge technologies whose power cannot be realized at the moment.”On Jan. 25, Russian authorities presented the Digital Assets Regulation Bill, which defines and establishes a regulatory system for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, mining and trading.According to the latest update of the bill, the Ministry of Finance is aiming to legally adopt cryptocurrency trading, since it would reduce the risks of fraud and increase the government’s tax revenue, due to the potential for fiscal transparency.According to local crypto news site Forklog, the final version of the bill will be officially released no later than July 1, 2018, which means the current version could still be altered before the law goes into effect.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Sberbank    #Switzerland  
Bitcoin - It’s Big in Japan,Darryn Pollock,1/8/2018 13:50,47166,538,"While the Asian market accounts for a large portion of the cryptocurrency market, not all of the countries in the East have been as receptive to the burgeoning market. However, the situation is totally different in Japan thanks to a soft approach from government and much higher adoption.Japan continues to lead the way in the East with its approach and as such, there is a higher interest from the citizens, including from the self-proclaimed ‘Miss Bitcoin.’Mai Fujimoto, aka Miss Bitcoin on her social media platforms, figure-heads an attitude that seems to be crowing in the Land of the Rising Sun. She boasts how all of her disposable income is deposited straight into Bitcoin.“I convert all my disposable income into cryptocurrency,” the 32-year-old told AFP. “I’ve been doing this for nearly a year now. I convert all my savings into cryptocurrency instead of putting them in a bank.”The attitude in places like China and even Korea is one of the people battling against the regulators. There is huge interest in these two nations from the citizens, but regulators have put their foot down.China’s ban on ICOs, and then exchanges, set a huge precedent in terms of the hard-nosed approach to digital currencies.Korea also recently started taking steps towards its own style of the ban on digital currencies, however, despite that, there is still massive interest.Japan also set its own precedent in the understanding of Bitcoin as back in April it was announced that Bitcoin was accepted as legal tender, instantly showing a positive approach from the government.Japan also benefited greatly from China’s ban as many companies and investors crossed the Sea of Japan to set up shop on the Island.Japan was also the pioneer in terms of Bitcoin adoption as about six months ago there was a boom in businesses trying to integrate Bitcoin payment systems. Even salaries are starting to be paid partly in Bitcoin. A well-known commentator on the crypto-business in Japan Koji Higashi said:“The involvement of big companies, the sense of security derived from government approval and media exposure really brought in a whole new group of people to the market.”Bitcoin also comes at a great time for the investment-savvy Japanese as ultra-low interest rates from the deflation-battling central bank that has left investors scratching their heads for places to find returns on their cash.However, some are suggesting that it is more hype and mania than savvy investing.Higashi adds:“Everyone else is doing it now and I heard they are making a lot of money. I have to get on it now. That’s a very Japanese way of thinking. To be honest, I am not sure if people are buying into Bitcoin based on rational decision-making. It feels more of a short-term irrational mania to me.”",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #China    #ICO    #Banned Bitcoin    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Digital Currency    #Koji Higashi    #South Korea    #North Korea  
South Korean Banks Get Flash Probe Into Cryptocurrency Exchange Ties,William Suberg,1/8/2018 10:14,46759,333,"Authorities in South Korea will inspect six of the country’s major banks for money laundering as part of an unprecedented probe into cryptocurrency links.As local news media report Sunday, the combined move by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) aims to decide whether the institutions “carried out their obligations to prevent money laundering in managing virtual accounts.”Woori Bank, Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, NongHyup Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea and Korea Development Bank are due to receive an “extensive probe” which will be complete by Thursday this week.As speculative investments into Bitcoin and altcoins continue to trouble regulators worldwide, Korea has taken a hardline stance in recent months.New legislation will seek to place heavy restrictions on how cryptocurrency exchanges can operate in the country, as well as who can use them and to what extent.South Koreans will likely only be able to hold one exchange account linked to their real name, while tax obligations are also being overhauled regarding profits.Reporting on the inspection, Yonhap News Agency appeared to forecast a predatory climate for exchanges.“They (the FIU and FSS) are seeking to cut off fund inflows into cryptocurrency exchanges and shutter cryptocurrency exchanges that have loopholes in their system,” it claims.What these “loopholes” might entail remains vague, yet the security setup of principal exchanges has come into the spotlight following an organized hacking attempt by a Korean news agency.Using private white-hat hackers, the agency successfully gained entry into exchange accounts it set up maliciously, bypassing even two-factor authentication, it reported last month.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies  
New US Bill Seeks To Fight Terrorist Use of Cryptocurrencies,Molly Jane Zuckerman,1/17/2018 19:07,46231,323,"A newly proposed Jan. 10 US bill aims to fight terrorism by offering rewards for information that results in convictions of cryptocurrency-supported terrorism.The bill, introduced to Congress by Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC) of the House Financial Services Committee, proposes an Independent Financial Technology Task Force to dole out the rewards, whose amount in either dollars or cryptocurrency was not indicated.The second section of the bill reads:“It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should prioritize the investigation of terrorist and illicit use of new financial technology, including digital currencies.”The fintech task force would be run by the Secretary of the Treasury and filled by five federal directors and four private sector individuals from think tanks, non-profits, and the banking industry.The bill also calls for the creation of a FinTech Leadership in Innovation Fund to inspire the development of programs and methods for detecting digital currency use among terrorists. This fund could give grants to universities, companies, NGOs, and any individuals that could contribute to research on anti-terrorist detection tools.In May of 2017, a US bill was brought forward that would require users crossing the US border to declare their cryptocurrency assets if they exceeded more than $10,000. The bill’s aim was to combat money laundering, which is often the source of terrorists’ funding.Despite regulators’ increasing attention towards cryptocurrency-financed terrorism, a June 2017 report from the European Union found that terrorists still prefer fiat over digital currency, possibly because of the tracking potential of Blockchain records.",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Terrorism    #Money Laundering    #Cryptocurrencies  
Ripple CEO Talks Liquidity And Regulation: Ultimately Governments Aren’t Going Away,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/6/2018 0:37,44749,448,"Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple — a US-based payment network and protocol company — spoke with Cointelegraph at the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco earlier this year about what problems Ripple can solve in the global marketplace, and the company’s approach to government regulation and traditional finance.Garlinghouse, a Harvard Business School graduate, previously worked at various positions at Yahoo!, including Senior Vice President, and AOL, where he was President of Consumer Applications. Garlinghouse has also served on the board of Ancestry.com, Tonic Health, and Animoto.Ripple, whose native currency is XRP, has partnered with over 100 companies and financial institutions to send money worldwide using Ripple’s Blockchain-based technology.Ripple’s price began a skyrocketing uptrend in mid-December 2017, peaking at almost $4 per coin on Jan. 4, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ripple’s December rise can be attributed in part to their multiple partnerships with traditional finance companies, as mentioned above.In addition, the South Korean crypto market played an important role in bringing XRP’s market capitalization past $100 bln in early January, the first altcoin to reach such numbers.When CoinMarketCap took major South Korean exchanges off its listings in early January 2018, XRP saw a drop of more than $20 bln in market cap.Since the start of 2018, Ripple has announced several new partnerships with financial institutions around the world. On Feb. 7, Ripple reported a new partnership with China-based payment services provider Lian-Lian, and a week later, Ripple made public a new relationship with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority to pilot cross-border payment programs to banks.On Feb. 14, Western Union confirmed that it is beginning testing of Ripple’s Blockchain-based settlement system for transactions.With a market cap of $37 bln, Ripple is currently the second largest altcoin on CoinMarketCap, trading at an average of just under $1 to press time, down 4.67 percent on the day.CT: Taking into consideration Ripple’s large uptick in January, its subsequent dip, and the stream of partnership announcements, what are the factors you think are the most influential in Ripple’s meteoric rise over the past couple of months?BRAD: The first thing I’ll say is I think it’s very hard to know exactly what drives any specific market. I think at Ripple we have continually tried to focus on solving a real problem for real customers. I think there’s obviously a lot of hype in the Blockchain space broadly and I think at the end of the day, from a long-term point of view, the value of any digital asset will be determined by its utility.If you aren’t solving a real problem for real customers, you’re not going to drive velocity and activity in that digital asset.What you’ve seen time and time again, when I say time and time again I’m talking about all markets, not just crypto and Blockchain, [is the idea of solving a real problem]. If you are able to solve a real problem for real customers [then you’re valued]. Especially if it’s a very, very big problem.For Ripple, that global liquidity problem is measured in the trillions of dollars, I think that people are realizing that Ripple is gaining traction, we’re gaining engagement, we’re gaining more customers. So there’s been interest in that.There’s a lot of science experiments in the Blockchain space. I think we are still at that starting line of the Blockchain space, overall. But We [Ripple] are the only ones that have actually crossed the starting line. There’s a marathon ahead, and I think we have a long way to go. But it’s clear that Ripple has passed the starting line. And I think there are a lot of people who are still experimenting with trying to figure out their product market fit.2017 has been a big year for regulation globally — ranging from crypto bans in China to crypto-friendly regulation in Japan — but the US has yet to come up with a solid regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technologies, and ICOs in particular.  In December of last year, the Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated the Fed’s 2014 position that they have no authority to regulate cryptocurrencies, explaining that the Fed does not differentiate between crypto and fiat currencies when supervising banks to make sure they are complying with US law.After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) circulated a number of warnings to investors about the “risks” of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in 2017, the SEC and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) held a joint hearing on cryptocurrencies on Feb. 6 of this year.  In the hearing the regulators decided to work together to provide “smart” regulation for cryptocurrencies, encourage Blockchain development, and be more attentive to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), to make sure they comply with US securities law.Recently, on Feb. 16, the SEC suspended trading in three crypto-related companies for investor protection purposes. On Feb. 28, media reported that the SEC had undertaken a probe into 80 cryptocurrency-related companies, including Overstock.com and a crypto fund created by TechCrunch’s founder.In February 2018, US states Arizona, Wyoming, and Georgia all introduced crypto-centered bills related to taxation and securities law.CT: As Ripple is based in the US, what is your approach to dealing with regulation both within the country and internationally?BRAD: Two thoughts.One thing that is interesting for me at Ripple is that in some ways people viewed Ripple as the contrarian. We were from the beginning really looking at how we work with governments, how we work with banks. And I think some in the crypto community have been very much, “How do we destroy the government. How do we circumvent banks?”I think that has differentiated us and I think ultimately governments aren’t going away. In my lifetime, I don’t think that’s happening.I am proud to be able to call the Bank of England a paid customer of Ripple’s. We believe absolutely there should be thoughtful regulation in crypto, in Blockchain.When we engage with customers, we are not changing the existing regulatory framework, meaning if, for example, the Bank of X has an account, you have to KYC – know your customer – you have to do the KYC check. If the Bank of X is using Ripple’s technology, you’re still doing your KYC check, you’re still doing your AML [anti-money laundering] check, you still need OFAC compliance, etc.When we talk to regulators, we explain how what Ripple is doing is not circumventing their regulatory frameworks, and they get very comfortable very quickly like, “Oh! I get it. Ok, we get it. If it’s a better product at lower price, we’re happy about that.”CT: Thank you so much, we really appreciate it.This interview was conducted in collaboration with Cointelegraph news editor, Olivia Capozzalo.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ripple    #Markets    #USA    #Government    #XRP    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies  
"South Korea to Soon Legalize Bitcoin and Ethereum, Protect Traders From Bubble Burst",Joseph Young,7/3/2017 17:40,43666,2870,"On July 3, Representative Park Yong-Jin of the ruling Democratic Party of South Korea announced that revisions on the regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin would be released in the upcoming months.Three bills will be drafted and revised by South Korean lawmaker Park with the sole focus on legalizing Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the proposal obtained by local publications including The Korean Herald, Park emphasized the necessity to protect South Korean users, traders and investors from potential risks and the event of a digital currency bubble burst.One of the first steps Park and his team will take in the process of legalizing Bitcoin and Ethereum is to revise the Electronic Financial Transactions Act, which will allow businesses and companies involving cryptocurrencies such as trading platforms and Bitcoin exchanges to retain capital of at least $436,000 and implement strict KYC and AML systems.Such requirement will not be an issue for most South Korean Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges as they are backed by some of the country’s largest billion dollar corporations and global venture capital firms.Korbit, the second largest digital currency trading platform in South Korea which supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Ripple, is backed by the country’s largest $19.2 bln telecommunications company SKT and SoftBank Ventures Korea.Bithumb, the largest Bitcoin trading platform in the country, is operated by a public company called BTC Korea. It is currently looking to raise capital through a paid-in capital increase in the South Korean stock exchange. During its peak, Bithumb processed more than $750 mln worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic and Ripple, solidifying its position as the largest trading platform in the country.At the moment, Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone, the three largest digital currency trading platforms in South Korea that control nearly 100 percent of the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market, have no legal grounds according to Park and the Financial Supervisory Service.Therefore, the three exchanges along with other small trading platforms in South Korea will have to be licensed and regulated by the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service, which will require the retention of capital of at least $436,000.More to that, new KYC and AML requirements established by the government will likely not be an issue for the majority of existing business and trading platforms as most exchanges have already integrated strict KYC and AML systems upon their launch. Some platforms such as Korbit, Bithumb and Coinplug are widely known for their strict verification process to avoid potential conflict with South Korean regulations.In an interview with The Korean Herald, law firm Minwho head attorney Kim Kyung-hwan explained that the regulation and legalization of Bitcoin and virtual currencies would ensure that both traders and businesses will operate within the legal boundary without running into conflict with existing financial regulations.Kyung-hwan said:“User protection, tax evasion and money laundering have long been issues in terms of digital currency transaction. Digital currency traders have often found themselves in trouble because they are out of a legal boundary.”",15,  #Bitcoin News    #Ethereum News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea  
EU Amends AML Laws for Cryptotrading as US Ponders: Expert Blog,Selva Ozelli,1/6/2018 7:13,43653,541,"Expert Blog is Cointelegraph’s new series of articles by crypto industry leaders. It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset management company, BlackRock, told a panel at the Institute of International Finance:""Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world. It’s an index of money laundering.""Fink’s sentiment about virtual currencies reflected that of an IRS Criminal Investigation division official who told reporters in 2013 – after concluding a multi-jurisdictional investigation and shuttering a $6 billion virtual currency exchange for money laundering:“If Al Capone were alive today, this is how he would be hiding his money.”Recently, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published a report that provides an overview of the US efforts to police the global illicit drug trade. The report claims that virtual currencies - Bitcoin, Zcash, Monero, and Ethereum - are increasingly being used in the digital underground to facilitate trade-based money laundering schemes for transnational criminal organizations (TCO).Over the past 10 years, the drug landscape in the US has vastly changed, with the opioid threat reaching epidemic levels in a significant portion of the country. Drug poisoning is a the leading cause of deaths in the US, with approximately 170 people dying from it every day. The opioid epidemic was declared a national emergency by President Trump last August, when Bitcoin was trading at $4,000.According to DEA’s report, the Mexican TCOs are the greatest criminal drug threat to the US. In the beginning of this year, when Bitcoin was trading at $1,000, the Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman Loera (El Chapo) was extradited by Mexico to the US. The extradition followed Mexico’s recapturing of the fugitive drug lord following his brazen escape from a maximum-security Mexican prison via an elaborate mile-long tunnel that connected to his prison cell.In the US, El Chapo is facing a long list of criminal charges, including drug trafficking and money laundering, for running one of the most powerful and sophisticated transnational drug trafficking organizations in this world.DEA’s report ties the extreme success of the Mexican TCOs to multiple factors, such as:The DEA report pointed out that China has become an important hub for money laundering schemes. TCOs purchase large shipments of “made in China” goods using Bitcoin. These “made in China” goods are then shipped to businessmen in Mexico and South America who reimburse the TCOs in local currency. Bitcoin payments are widely popular in China because it can be used to anonymously transfer value overseas, circumventing China’s capital controls.On November 28, 2017, when Bitcoin was trading at $9,880, the US Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on Senate bill S. 1241, titled ‘‘Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017.” This bill amends the current US anti-money laundering laws (AML) by making virtual currencies more of a target for regulatory oversight. Prepaid access devices, digital wallets and other digital currency exchangers as being subjected to reporting requirements if they contain the virtual currency equivalent of $10,000 or higher.According to Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, S. 1241 is designed to help modernize US AML laws. Grassley explained:“[S. 1241 will give] law enforcement more tools to prosecute and close legal loopholes. It will clarify rules on evidence for prosecutors and judges, which in turn will help increase convictions. It will make it easier to go after drug kingpins, drug cartels and terrorist organizations by being able to seize virtual currencies more easily.”European governments are pushing for global Bitcoin regulation at the G20 level, coordinated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Amid mounting alarm that virtual currencies are being used by multinational money-launderers, drug traffickers and terrorists, the German Finance Ministry explained:“It makes sense to discuss the speculative risks of virtual currencies and their impact on the financial system at international level.”Several EU countries will create interconnected registries this year, to record details of the beneficial ownership of inter alia companies and trusts under the EU Fourth Anti- Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD). These central registries of beneficial owners will be made available to local tax authorities and will be shared between tax authorities within the EU (OECD-BEPS Action 12).On December 20, 2017, when Bitcoin was trading at $17,000, the European Parliament and its executive arm, the European Council, agreed to amend the 4AMLD. This amendment will make virtual currency exchange platforms and wallets subject to the beneficial ownership-reporting requirements (4AMLD Virtual Currency Amendment).These new regulations will require an increase in transparency by trusts and trading companies, which will be pressured to reveal the holders of virtual currency in order to thwart potential money laundering, tax evasion and terror funding. Primary among these regulations is a requirement to provide beneficial ownership information to authorities and “any persons that can demonstrate a legitimate interest” to access data on the beneficial owners of trusts.The 4AMLD Virtual Currency Amendment must be formally adopted by EU Member States and turned into national laws within 18 months.Selva Ozelli, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for TaxNotes, Bloomberg BNA, and the OECD.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Law    #AML    #Money Laundering    #Mexico    #USA  
US: Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms Must Be Registered With SEC,Ana Alexandre,3/7/2018 22:13,43345,443,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now requires that platforms trading digital assets which meet the definition of a security must register with the agency as an exchange,  according to a public statement issued by the regulatory body on Wednesday, March 7.Cryptocurrency exchanges would subsequently be governed by the same rules as traditional exchanges. For this reason, they must register with the SEC “as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration”.In the statement, the SEC warns that many online trading platforms referring to themselves as exchanges are currently unregulated, though they can give the impression that they are compliant with the regulatory standards.“The SEC staff has concerns that many online trading platforms appear to investors as SEC-registered and regulated marketplaces when they are not,” said the SEC.The statement added that some of these unlawful trading platforms establish their own rules and standards when picking digital assets that are not approved or endorsed by the SEC.The SEC added that entities aiming to operate as an alternative trading system (ATS) are also subject to regulatory requirements. Exchanges of this kind should register with the SEC as a broker-dealer and become a member of a self-regulatory organization (SRO).“Registration as a broker-dealer subjects the ATS to a host of regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to have reasonable policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of material non-public information, books and records requirements, and financial responsibility rules, including, as applicable, requirements concerning the safeguarding and custody of customer funds and securities,”  the SEC wrote.According to the statement, the SEC is undertaking these regulatory measures “to protect investors and prevent against fraudulent and manipulative trading practices.” The agency is also open to assisting trading platforms implementing new technologies to comply with federal securities laws.In February 2018, at a SEC and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) joint senate hearing, SEC chairman Jay Clayton promised smart and practical regulations for exchanges and investors dealing with Bitcoin and Ethereum, while Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) would be met with tighter regulations.",31,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA    #SEC    #Government  
Gibraltar To Introduce ‘World’s First’ ICO Regulations,Helen Partz,2/11/2018 18:00,42937,724,"Gibraltar’s government and Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) have announced that in the coming weeks they will develop a draft law that will regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in the British overseas territory, Reuters reported Feb. 9.The draft law, aiming to regulate the promotion, sale and distribution of digital tokens on the territory of Gibraltar, will be the first ever set of regulations developed specifically for ICOs, the lawmakers claim.One of the principal aspects of Gibraltar’s ICO regulations will be the introduction of the concept of “authorized sponsors,” who are supposed to be “responsible for assuring compliance with disclosure and financial crime rules,” said Sian Jones, one of GFSC’s senior advisors.The draft law will also establish disclosure rules that will require ICO projects to provide “adequate, accurate and balanced information to anyone buying tokens”, the government and Financial Services Commission said to Reuters.According to Reuters, over $3.7 bln was secured in ICO fundraisers worldwide in 2017, compared to $100 mln in 2016. This rapid expansion of the ICO market is what has reportedly provoked Gibraltarian regulators to take action.In September 2017, Cointelegraph reported that with fast increasing numbers of ICOs, the GFSC issued an official statement, warning investors of the “highly risky and speculative” nature of ICO fundraising campaigns.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Gibraltar    #ICO    #Investments

With the move, the exchange follows other financial institutions in introducing Bitcoin futures products.The CBOE will use the XBT ticker for its new products. The ticker is exactly the same as the one being used by Bitcoin exchange Kraken in its platform. It is also expected that CBOE will introduce different types of contracts in the near future in its bid to secure a major market share quickly. The product launching, however, will be mainly dependent on the performance of its new products.The demand for Bitcoin-based financial products is very high right now because of the continuous surge in the price of the number one cryptocurrency. Several financial institutions have also taken a complete turnaround on their assessment of Bitcoin.Among them is Goldman Sachs, which is now advising its investors not to ignore Bitcoin anymore. This is a complete about-face by the investment bank, which has previously criticized the digital currency.The high demand for Bitcoin futures and derivatives products is resulting in very tough competitions among industry players. With the entry of CBOE, competition is expected to intensify further because the exchange is the biggest of its kind in the US. It remains to be seen, however, if the exchange can outperform its competitors in this area.To effectively compete, there are issues that should be resolved by the exchange. Among these issues is how to relate its contracts to spot Bitcoin pricing.

South Korea Intelligence Creates Task Force to Oversee Local Cryptocurrency Exchanges,Joseph Young,1/25/2018 20:03,41386,356,"South Korean financial authorities in cooperation with Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KFIU) created a task force to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges and to ensure cryptocurrency businesses are compliant with existing regulations, authorities announced on Jan. 25. It will collaborate with local cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure that money laundering and fraudulent activities using cryptocurrencies do not occur in the local market, according to KFIU.Local financial authorities will also require six major South Korean banks that have decided to support cryptocurrency exchanges to report to KFIU if suspicious activities are unraveled. Local banks including Shinhan Bank, Nonghyup, IKB, Woori Bank are expected to file regular reports to the KFIU on suspicious trading and prevent financial crimes.After officially refuting the Justice Ministry’s cryptocurrency trading ban proposal, the South Korean government has allocated significant resources to regulate the local cryptocurrency market and provide a more stable and robust infrastructure to investors within the market.For many weeks, the majority of South Korean investors in both the traditional finance sector and cryptocurrency market have been outraged by insider trading initiated by government officials working for the South Korea Financial Services Commission.Last week, Choi Heung Sik, director of the FSC, admitted that employees of the agency sold Bitcoin immediately before the false cryptocurrency trading ban announcement of the country’s Justice Minister Park Sang-ki and bought Bitcoin after the announcement.At the time, Hong Nam-ki, head of the state coordination division, said:“The government is currently investigating into the several government officials that were alleged to have initiated insider trading. Given that it is not appropriate for a government official to trade cryptocurrencies, the agency will encourage its employees to prevent from trading cryptocurrencies in the short-term.”In the aftermath of the South Korean cryptocurrency trading ban fiasco, the approval rating of President Moon Jae-in hit an all-time low below 60 percent, and the government was heavily criticized for negligence.Starting this week, to counterbalance the mishandling of the false cryptocurrency trading ban by the Justice Ministry, the South Korean government and financial authorities have begun to regulate the local cryptocurrency market and businesses strictly. Previously, the South Korean government was hesitant towards regulating cryptocurrency businesses because it feared the South Korean people would consider it as an endorsement of the market.Up until last week, South Korean investors feared that banks would cut money flow into the market by disabling bank accounts, as the Justice Minister claimed in his controversial premature statement about the cryptocurrency market.Concerns of local investors only intensified when Kookmin Bank announced the closure of virtual bank accounts deployed on cryptocurrency exchanges.However, since then, six major South Korean banks have provided support to local exchanges, KFIU has started to regulate the market and the government has begun to consider cryptocurrency businesses as legitimate financial service providers.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Tradings

The regulations will also ban the issuance of new virtual accounts to crypto exchanges.South Korea’s plan to ban anonymous exchange operations is nothing new, today’s announcement merely setting the exact date.Authorities had announced the ban at the end of December, but had not yet set a concrete date for when the regulations would go into effect. “Establishment of a system for ‘real name verification of deposit and withdrawal accounts’ for settlements will be completed by January 30, 2018,” the FSC documentation released today states.In mid-January, South Korean authorities announced that crypto exchange customers had until the end of the month to convert virtual bank accounts connected to crypto exchanges to real-name ones, noting that those who do not comply will face fines.In addition, Non-Koreans and minors will no longer be able to trade cryptocurrency on the country’s exchanges, a point that lawmakers had also previously made known.Also this week, plans to levy a combined corporation tax and local income tax of 24.2% on exchange profits for 2017 were announced, with platforms obliged to pay by March 30 and April 30 respectively.Bitcoin prices continue to fall in the 24 hours to press time, falling below $10,000 this afternoon, Jan. 23, and causing losses for multiple altcoin assets as a result.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Markets    #Media    #South Korea    #Tradings

Expert: African Regulatory Environment Has To Change For Blockchain Innovation To Flourish,Olusegun Ogundeji,12/26/2016 17:40,206,357,"A lack of cooperation between regulators and Blockchain players threatens innovation in parts of Africa.The associate professor at the University of Nairobi’s School of Business says that the continent’s regulatory environment has to be changed in order to encourage growth.Bitange Ndemo noted in a piece for “Business Daily Africa” that Africa requires “radical regulatory interventions to increase both access and affordability of digital inclusion.”He states:“Blockchain technologies will change our future. We must be ready to collaborate and encourage multidisciplinary mechanisms to advance Africa. We have the greatest opportunity to break from past dependencies and begin to control our destiny. For this to happen, we must drastically change our regulatory environment and make it responsive to innovation. Technology is changing fast. We cannot isolate Africa, or any other continent or country, from the happenings elsewhere in this interconnected world.”The lack of regulation surrounding the Blockchain technology and Bitcoin - the digital currency which has been openly criticized by governments in most parts of Africa - has hindered its acceptance as a viable tool to prepare for an inevitable future. This has been worsened by the limited knowledge that many Africans have about the technology.Though it is now changing, several African governments have considered Bitcoin to be risky due to the lack of a regulatory framework and have always warned their citizens to avoid its use.Even as the challenges and opportunities to be derived from Blockchain are being explored as well as their likely impact on the current social, economic and political order, the issue of regulation still lingers.Yet, according to ICT experts, Blockchain technology has what it takes to solve a variety of problems for the continent.Ndemo added that Blockchain cannot succeed in Africa until the increasing digital divide, in a future that assumes that everyone has a digital footprint, has been dealt with.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Blockchain News    #Africa

We plan to be fully operational at the start of the new Congress in January 2015.CT: What is your opinion of the draft of regulations released by New York State?PB: The Chamber of Digital Commerce finds the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) proposed BitLicense rules and regulations to be severely debilitating to the digital currency industry. Despite Ben Lawsky’s claims that these proposed regulations are intended to be guardrails to “protect consumers and root out illegal activity – without stifling beneficial innovation” these rules could potential crush the Bitcoin industry in New York and stifle jobs, investment, and innovation. The Digital Chamber agrees that we need guardrails in these areas, but these proposed regulations are onerous and in many cases simply misplaced, potentially seriously injuring legitimate applications of this valuable emerging area.CT: Did these regulations have any effect on any of your plans with the Digital Chamber of Commerce?PB: The Digital Chamber is calling on the Bitcoin community to submit comments to the NYDFS. Instructions on how to submit comments can be found on the NYDFS website at www.dos.ny.gov/info/register.htm.CT: Why is a Bitcoin Trade Association necessary?PB: To date, the digital currency industry has only been informally represented in Washington, DC.

"Indian Bank Rejects Dead Father’s Cash For Family, Demonetization Chaos Continues",Joseph Young,1/26/2017 18:00,199,234,"Shivcharan Singh Maran, a father of a small household who died at the age of 93, left 50,000 rupees, hereinafter Rs, in 500 Rs banknotes for his family before he passed away.The bundle of cash worth $750 was rejected by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) because 500 banknotes were previously demonetized by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Mastan, the son of Shivcharan, discovered a bundle of cash amidst cleaning the room of his father after his death. The bundle of cash was found in sets of 500 Rs banknotes hidden in a closet of the room. Mastan and the rest of his family realized that Shivcharan forgot to remind his family about the money and that he wasn’t aware that the demonetization of 500 Rs banknotes had taken effect.It was later revealed by a respected local Indian publication News18 that Shivcharan was suffering from short-term memory loss and thus was not aware of the demonetization or any other changes in Indian financial regulations the government had imposed.Even if Shivcharan had known about the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 Rs banknotes, his short-term memory loss would have prevented him from discussing with the family about the matter.On behalf of his family, Mastan visited a local branch of the Reserve Bank of India and formally requested the bank to change the old and ineffective banknotes to newly designed cash. However, the bank rejected the request of Mastan regardless of the explanation of the situation Mastan provided.Employees of the RBI simply told Mastan that the banknotes can no longer be replaced with the exception of non-resident Indians (NRIs), who are citizens of India that hold an Indian passport but resided abroad for over six months for employment or other purposes.To put it simply, the RBI told Mastan that the old banknotes can not be taken back by the bank unless an NRI presents the cash to the RBI headquarters located in New Delhi.Although News18 reported that Mastan is trying to search for alternative ways to receive newly designed banknotes in compensation for his father’s ineffective 500 Rs banknotes, it is highly unlikely that the RBI would provide an exceptional offer for Mastan.The financial crisis and economic instability in India caused by the demonetization of banknotes and confiscation of gold are causing significant discomfort to the Indian people.Ironically, the two initiatives of demonetization and gold seizure were led by the Indian government to crack down on criminals. Instead, the vast majority of the general population was negatively affected by the government’s impractical policies.Earlier this week, Cointelegraph published an article entitled “Bitcoin On The Rise in India: Steady in Growth, Impossible to Shut Down,” portraying the rapid growth of Bitcoin in the country. Considering that the country’s safe haven asset in gold and main store of value in cash have become increasingly inefficient and difficult to handle. It is becoming more obvious that the Indian people are seeking for alternatives such as Bitcoin to protect their wealth.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Cash    #Demonetization    #Government    #India  
Hong Kong Government: Blockchain May Increase Money Laundering Risks,Joseph Young,11/16/2016 13:45,198,146,"Amid the surging demand for the Blockchain technology, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) warns banks and financial institutions that the implementation of decentralized Blockchain networks may increase money laundering risks, creating an ideal environment for the emergence of criminal activities and illicit transactions.Most of the world’s leading banks and financial institutions are attempting to integrate the Blockchain technology into their existing systems. Its mining-based network and decentralized nature enables firms to store and transfer monetary data instantaneously with low fees.The mechanism of utilizing a shared network amongst both administrators and users allows the settlement of money in real time, allowing banks to process cross-border payments in a more cost-efficient and secure manner.However, the HKMA states that the anonymous and decentralized characteristics of the Blockchain technology may lead banks into conflicts with financial regulations and KYC policies, particularly if banks are not able to manipulate and control the transactions.Banks and financial institutions have been struggling to find a way to implement the Blockchain technology, primarily due to various financial regulations.By default, banks are not permitted to integrate decentralized networks, as law enforcement and authorities would not be able to control the network and its settlements. Thus, the only method of integrating the Blockchain technology is by creating a permissioned ledger, or a controllable ledger, that is centralized and grants a certain level of control to network administrators.While the idea of creating a centralized Blockchain network seems simple in theory, mathematically and systematically, it will pose an enormous security threat to the bank’s IT infrastructure.Thus, the question comes down to:Do banks continue their attempt to integrate a permissioned Blockchain network? Or do banks attempt to integrate distributed ledgers in spite of regulatory frameworks?As the HKMA states, regulators will not allow the integration of decentralized networks. If they did permit it, banks would have already demonstrated commercial use-cases of the Blockchain technology.HK central bank’s Executive Director Shu Pui Li stated:“[Blockchain offers] good potential, but a lot of things need to be addressed. The most painful issue is legal. A lot of legal issues.”With global budget for Blockchain development surpassing the $1 bln mark, Li believes that banks and financial institutions must be more cautious in approaching the Blockchain technology.There exists an important reason behind the increasing investment in the Blockchain market and that is the desperate effort of banks to prove the applicability of the Blockchain technology.However, because of regulatory frameworks and security issues, neither decentralized Blockchains and permissioned networks can be integrated.“Be prudent, don’t get too excited,” Li said.",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Hong Kong    #Government    #Money Laundering  
Malaysia joins Singapore in hands-off policy on Bitcoin,Eric Barrier,1/6/2014 10:21,194,0,"Malaysia’s Central Bank has chimed in with a couple of other countries to issue policy statements on Bitcoin at the beginning of this new year. Bank Negara Malaysia said in an announcement on its website that it would not consider Bitcoin as legal tender, nor would it take any steps to regulate it. “The public is therefore advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency,” the statement read. This strongly mirrors the policy set forth by an announcement from Singapore’s central bank just before Christmas. The ramifications of this announcement are not yet clear. It could be that banks are trying to distance themselves from the digital currency, or it could be that banks are setting up for a later crackdown. BitcoinMalaysia.com founder Colbert Low told that Malaysia’s Bitcoin scene is still thriving and that the announcement would have no effect on local Bitcoin activity. Contrast the tone of the Malaysian announcement with that of the Bank of Lebanon, which just last month warned against “purchasing, keeping or using e-money.” Malaysia is much like neighboring Singapore in that it has a whole generation of educated IT professionals ready to build a digital currency infrastructure in a country already attracting foreign financial-services customers.

A ban on cash salary payments which is a common practice in Russia but also a major source of income tax evasion is also up for discussion.The Russian newspaper Vedomosti states that lawmakers are looking to India and Azerbaijan as a source of inspiration for taxing cash but still in principle “do not know how to it” effectively.Both the aforementioned countries give tax reductions to purchases made by card.While Russia is no longer a largely cash-based economy, the government is far from alone in wanting to cut down on its use. Several countries worldwide - India a notable example - have commenced a so-called “war on cash” by withdrawing banknotes and advocating new payment methods.At the same time, Russia’s central bank recently reiterated a lack of desire to ban cryptocurrency use, instead of saying suitable regulations should be applied.

Silicon Valley Bank’s Survey Reveals the Biggest Concerns FinTech Businesses Expect to Face in 2016,Nina Lyon,11/18/2015 18:23,189,0,"The latest Silicon Valley Bank survey suggests that FinTech businesses expect regulatory issues to be one of the biggest concerns in 2016.According to the survey, founders and investors from financial technology companies are worried that regulators can slow down innovation and businesses development.“As many as 43 percent of the 101 respondents surveyed during SVB’s Fintech Mashup event said that regulatory changes were the most difficult to cope with, a runaway number-one problem ahead of companies’ reluctance to adopt new technologies, cited by 24 percent of respondents. The number-three biggest challenge for the fintech industry was seen to be changing consumer behavior, with 18 percent being worried about it, followed by access to funding, noted by 15 percent of respondents as a challenge,” reads the publication.The survey shows that 24% of respondents showed their interest in disrupting traditional financial services. Moreover, while 46% of respondents call blockchain a problem that should be solved, most of respondents – 54% believe that this technology “is providing a solution for financial institutions”.Bruce Wallace, Chief Digital Officer of SVB Financial Group, stated:""The attendees at the Fintech Mashup event validated what fintech companies around the world have been voicing in recent years – an effective regulatory and compliance strategy is critical to their ultimate success.""Cointelegraph reached out to a number of Bitcoin and blockchain experts and asked them if they think that regulatory issues are one of the biggest problems to slow down innovation so far.Alena Vranova, Co-Founder and CEO at SatoshiLabs, commented:“I believe regulation [of Bitcoin as money and technology] is not only unnecessary but may be harmful. A central legislatory authority can never estimate well the evolution of such a new phenomena. The only positive influence I can imagine from the state is to say. We believe this needs support and the banks shall stop flagging bitcoin businesses and stop preventing them normal interaction with the banking system.”Jamie Burke, Founding Partner of OutlierVentures.io, said:“As someone actively investing in blockchain based fintech the two greatest risks we personally see are the UK government's position on encryption and our own business banking partners catch-all assessment of us a company that is 'in some way involved in the world of crypto'.”“With regards to the UK government's policy towards encryption, a fundamental cornerstone of blockchain systems, they risk throwing away being not just Europe's, but the world's centre of blockchain  innovation,” said Jamie Burke. “I already know of a handful of promising startups in this space like Eris Industries that have up and left as a consequence. I myself am building the HQ for a European Blockchain Incubator and fund set to invest millions here in the UK but will have to seriously consider moving it to a more friendly environment if hysteria, fuelled by the recent escalation in terrorism, pushes the government into to a regressive position.

Should Tax on Bitcoin Be Eliminated?

When trading, the exchange suggested users consult registered tax professionals to ensure that they are compliant with South African regulations.Most countries that have fully adopted and regulated Bitcoin such as Japan have eliminated the tax on Bitcoin trading. On April 1, Japan officially declared Bitcoin’s exemption from consumption tax and eliminated the possibility of double taxation on trading. Recently, the Australian government also exempted Bitcoin trading from goods and services tax (GST).“The Government has released a consultation paper on changing the GST treatment of digital currencies. This change will ensure that consumers are no longer ‘double taxed’ when using digital currencies to buy goods and services already subject to GST,” read the 2016 - 17 Budget Report of the Australian government.In South Africa, however, Bitcoin trading is subjected to general principles of South African tax law. The South African Revenue Service stated that transactions or speculation in Bitcoin are subject to tax and should be taxed accordingly. The government institution further emphasized that it is the responsibility of both citizens and residents of South Africa to report relevant details to the South African Revenue Service.Former BitX Product Design Director and Blockchain investor Simon Dingle also stated that Bitcoin trading in South Africa could trigger a capital gains event and encouraged traders and investors to consult tax professionals before trading on South African exchanges.“It may trigger a capital gains event, or could qualify as income for active traders. All assets are treated equally in terms of tax,” said Dingle.More to that, income received in Bitcoin and other digital currencies are taxed as conventional income tax. It is still unknown whether double taxation applies and, as a result, if users are subject to both income tax and capital gains tax.Additionally, Luno Head of Growth Werner van Rooyen stated that various factors could impact taxation on Bitcoin transactions and trading depending on the situation of users.Rooyen stated:”There are various factors that could impact taxes an individual owes to the tax authorities, The short answer is that all income is taxable in South Africa and it is the responsibility of individuals to remain tax compliant.”The Australian Treasury changed its regulations and taxation policies on Bitcoin after seeing a sharp decline in interest in Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the country. Exchanges that used to operate in the country have left Australia to other Bitcoin-friendly regions such as Singapore and Hong Kong.For that reason, the Australian Treasury removed the double taxation of Bitcoin. As its report read:“For digital currency, the current treatment under the GST means that consumers are ‘double taxed’ when using digital currency to purchase anything already subject to GST. The Government recognises that this treatment may be preventing the use of digital currencies and hindering their further development.”Aggressive taxation policies on Bitcoin could also result in a delayed andlimited growth for the South African exchange market and Bitcoin industry. The South African government must consider the effect of double taxation and clarify the taxation policies that apply to Bitcoin and digital currencies.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taxes    #South Africa    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Tradings    #Government    #Werner van Rooyen    #Digital Currency  
Coin Center Demonstrates How Bitcoin Works Before the Congress,Anthony Coggine,7/5/2017 23:14,12979,529,"Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy agency, demonstrates how Bitcoin works before the members of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee on June 29, 2017.The growing population of Bitcoin miners and enthusiasts has alerted the government about the security repercussions which eventually led to series of discussions. The aforementioned committee held a hearing assessing the national security involving Blockchain technology transactions.The US Congress is concerned about the rise of Bitcoin now that it has been linked to several illegal activities and money laundering with their major worry being its potential use for terrorist funding hence the introduction of Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 bill.Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito testified before the committee to explain how Blockchain networks like Bitcoin actually work on hearing entitled “Virtual Currency: Financial Innovation and National Security Implications”.According to the memorandum of the said hearing, they’ve particularly explored “terrorists and illicit use of financial technology (FinTech), the national security implications of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, and the use of “blockchain” technologies to record transactions and uncover illicit activities”.For his part, Brito stressed on the fact that lawmakers should be approaching Blockchain technology as purpose-agnostic platform. Just like before the internet hit mass adoption, it was also rich with innovative potentials.Thus, the Blockchain advocacy agency called for a sound government approach on cryptocurrency. Furthermore, they also aim to educate the Committee so that they will understand the whole scenario and avoid relying solely upon third party information when assessing information about digital currency.Coin Center believes that the underlying concerns about the Blockchain technology is the lack of proper regulations and deep understanding of the technology. The agency argued that such issues can be avoided by helping the governing bodies get sufficient working knowledge about cryptocurrency.In a demonstration day event held last week, Coin Center shared about the benefits of cryptocurrencies and tackled their alleged risks. They partnered with Xapo, Chainalysis, and Elliptic to show how a typical user interacts with the Bitcoin network.According to Coin Center, the demo covered the processes starting from setting up a digital wallet and a hosted wallet, the stringent AML/KYC process, sending a transaction, to viewing transactions.With this educational effort for the cryptocurrency, it is still uncertain whether or not the government will consider the new facts laid before them into their decision making.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Congress    #coin center    #US Government  
Budget Cuts in Delaware Slows Down the Bill that Will Legalize of Issuance of Blockchain Stocks,Anthony Coggine,7/1/2017 0:05,12823,237,"In March, Delaware state legislators drafted a bill that would legalize the issuance of Bitcoin stocks. The state will also officially recognize Blockchain records as legitimate records. The move was formally introduced in May and eventually approved by its legislators in June.However, due to some budget cuts in the state, its legislators are being slowed down from the legalization of Blockchain stocks. As of present, $51 mln had been cut from the state’s budget making policies to be pushed later in the year.According to chair of Potter Anderson’s Business Group and chair of the Council of Corporation Law Section of the Delaware State Bar Association Matt O’Toole, this proposed legislation has a lot of potentials to benefit both the corporation and the stockholders.O’Toole states:“The relationship between the ultimate owner of the shares and the corporation will be made more immediate.” With this, Matt O’Toole seems quite confident that the legislation will definitely pass. He further explains that that the corporate bills such as this one are the ones that will be passed faster.""A couple of high-profile issues are basically going to be tabled until next year because they've got bigger fish to fry. But the corporate bills are important, everybody recognizes that, and I'm assured that they will be voted on and they will pass.""Though there may seem to be some delays with the legislation of the bills in the Delaware government, it seems as though the legislators understand the importance of the said bill and will want to put this it as a part of the priority bills to pass.Other major states have been drafting their own bills and regulations regarding Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. For instance, a few Bitcoin-friendly states include Texas and New Hampshire, and Nevada.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Delaware

Regulation is imminent and that’s a good thing.”CryptoUK intends to work with the UK government to follow a code of conduct that will help prevent money laundering and other illegal activities involving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as better protect customers. However, the group will not deal with regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), an area of the crypto industry that has received criticism from regulatory bodies globally.   CryptoUK chairman and managing director of eToro Iqbal Gandham, stated that the new self-regulating body is aiming ""to promote best practice and to work with government and regulators,"" adding that the company can become “the blueprint for what a future regulatory framework will look like.”Last week, the head of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Brian Quintenz, suggested that the cryptocurrency community should create its own regulatory system or self-regulatory organization (SRO) in order to avoid a “sterner government hand”.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #United Kingdom    #Coinbase    #Cex.io    #Tradings    #Cryptocurrencies  
"EU Regulators Caution Consumers Against ‘Highly Risky’ Crypto Investing, Again",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/12/2018 17:59,33627,293,"The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) has warned customers that cryptocurrencies are “highly risky” assets that show “clear signs of a pricing bubble” in a pan-European Union consumer warning released Monday, Feb. 12.The ESAs is made up of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).The high risk associated with investing in cryptocurrency, according to the ESAs, means that investors can ""lose a large amount, or even all, of the money invested:”""The ESAs warn consumers that VCs (virtual currencies) are highly risky and unregulated products and are unsuitable as investment, savings or retirement planning products.”The warning, published on the ESMA website, comes with an introduction that explains the fear that too many people are investing in crypto without fully understanding the risks.The official warning also brings up the idea that unregulated exchanges are unprotected because of their existence outside of global financial regulations, meaning a customer’s losses from an event like a cyberattack would not be covered by EU law.The ESAs’s warning ends with advice for investors to protect themselves:“You should not invest money you cannot afford to lose.”ESMA had previously warned customers in Nov. 2017 about Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), citing the same reasons of a lack of investor understanding and the problems with unregulated financial activities.The ESAs’s most recent warning today comes after the European Central Bank (ECB) told CNBC on Feb. 7 that crypto regulation is “not high on the to-do list.” Conversely, on Feb. 8, an ECB Executive Board member referred to cryptocurrency a “contagion” and “contamination” and called for preemptive regulation.",15,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies    #EBA    #ESMA    #ICO  
Chinese Central Bank Intends to Regulate ICO Market,Joseph Young,6/4/2017 16:49,33524,705,"China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, is planning on regulating the initial coin offering (ICO) market in the near future.Over the past year, an increasing number of Blockchain projects have utilized the Ethereum protocol to distribute unique tokens in a decentralized and transparent manner. The tokens released by independent Blockchain projects and companies are compatible with the Ethereum network and its native token.The vast majority of Blockchain companies that have initiated ICOs have found major success, raising tens of millions of dollars at a massive valuation. In fact, on May 3, Cointelegraph reported that Blockchain companies have raised 2.4x more capital from ICOs than traditional early-stage and venture capital funding.ICOs have offered Blockchain startups and projects an easy method of raising capital without the existence of intermediaries and mediators. Some projects such as Gnosis have raised millions of dollars at a staggering $300 mln valuation, which would likely not be possible with traditional early-stage and venture capital firms without an active user base and a solid revenue stream.More importantly, ICOs have allowed independent investors to participate in early-stage funding rounds of projects. Anyone can participate in an ICO by purchasing Ethereum to purchase unique tokens offered in ICO campaigns. Such decentralization has led to a larger market of potential investors and stakeholders.However, in the past few weeks, experts have begun to discuss the legality of ICOs and how they may run into conflict with the SEC and other government agencies in the future.Most recently, prominent Bitcoin trader WhalePanda wrote in his Consensus NY event recap blog post that the legality of ICOs was one of the major discussion points at the event.WhalePanda criticized many of the ICOs that have raised massive amounts of money, at a valuation surpassing hundreds of millions of dollars, for the lack of clear vision, user base, revenue stream and even a working product. WhalePanda specifically criticized Golem and Elastic in his writing.He wrote:“Take Golem for example: $400 million+ market cap and not even a properly working product, just because it’s on Ethereum. Elastic for example is a similar project, they raised 700+ BTC in donations but they basically have a superior working product close to launch. Or just think about the Gnosis launch. ICO insanity has to end badly.”Investors are concerned with regard to the legal ambiguity surrounding ICOs now that government agencies and central banks have started to get involved. Most recently, local Chinese news source cnLedger reported that Yao Qian, head of Digital Currency Research Institute at PBoC, mentioned that the central bank of China intends to regulate the ICO market soon.Also, despite the existence of smart contract and ICO auditing firms, some experts have advocated for the regulation of the ICO market.

New US Senate Bill Could be a Threat to Bitcoin Innovation,Anthony Coggine,6/28/2017 22:36,33468,875,"On May 25, Senator Chuck Grassley has introduced Senate Bill 1241 also known as “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017"".Along with fellow Senators Dianne Feinstein, John Cornyn and Sheldon Whitehouse, the bill aimed at modernizing and strengthening criminal laws against money laundering which is a potent source of funding for terrorist organizations, drug cartels and other organized crime syndicates.Moreover, US Bill S.1241 also aimed at deterring individuals entering the United States borders from bringing with them undeclared assets in the form of Bitcoin or other digital currencies.It would allow for civil asset forfeitures of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and require users to declare cryptocurrency assets exceeding $10,000 whenever they cross the US border.In separate statements, the four Senators pushing for the bill say it is crucial time for United States to address terrorist threats and other criminal activities by targeting the source of their funding, thus the need to recalibrate their anti-money laundering law to keep up with the digital age.Senator Chuck Grassley says:“Terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and other criminals are actively looking to exploit and harm Americans, whether by attacking our way of life, flooding our country with highly addictive drugs, or defrauding unknowing victims.  The recent terrorist attack in the United Kingdom is the latest somber example of how real these threats are to our country and its allies.  We must continue to fight them on every front, and that includes going after the profits of crime that are also used to fuel the ongoing activity of these diabolical enterprises.  Our bill updates our money laundering laws for the 21st Century”.Senator Dianne Feinstein comments:“Terrorist groups like ISIL and other transnational criminal organizations wouldn’t be able to finance their activities without illegal funds. Blocking these funds is an effective way to disrupt these organizations and prevent crime and terrorism. Our bill adopts many of the recommendations made by the Justice Department to ensure that transnational criminal organizations, including terrorist groups, face consequences for laundering illicit funds, evading laws and promoting criminal activity”.Senator John Cornyn:“We’re living in a time where the threats from our enemies are constantly evolving and it’s not enough to fight terrorism and crime in a reactionary manner.  To protect our country and Americans, we must aggressively and proactively go after their funding streams, and by strengthening our money laundering laws, we can help curb the illegal flow of money to terrorist organizations, drug cartels and crime organizations that fund their illicit activity”.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse:  “One of the best ways to track crime and serious threats to our country is to follow the money.  That’s why we need to crack down on the range of tricks criminals and terrorists can use to launder their dirty money to sustain their illegal enterprises.  I’m glad to join this bipartisan bill to bring our money laundering laws up to date”.While the bill was lauded for crossing party lines to address the nation's pressing problem, experts warned that the bill, once enacted, may actually stifle current innovations in the financial world.Center for New American Security (CNAS) report reveals:“There is no more than anecdotal evidence that terrorist groups have used virtual currencies to support themselves"".Thus, questions of the bill’s necessity are becoming a concern to the Blockchain community.According to Jerry Brito, Executive Director of Coin Center, Blockchain technology which underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is somehow as important as the web. While like the web which also attracts illegal activities, fighting those illegal actors should be down by reducing and not adding regulatory burden on digital currency companies.""One particular challenge in this area is the requirement for a virtual currency firm to obtain licenses in all states in which it operates and maintain compliance consistent with both federal and applicable state standards where they are licensed to operate. With only a single federal registration for virtual currency firms, compliance costs would be more manageable for smaller firms, and regulators would be better able to oversee firms”.Most government organizations are still exploring Blockchain and cryptocurrencies potential. Whether it be to augment existing innovation plans such as the case for the state of Illinois or the US Navy improving the security of their manufacturing process.Truth is, different states have different stance on cryptocurrency. Lastly, it is only a matter of time until some sort of regulation is put in place for Bitcoin and ICOs as there’s still a growing interest in various government regulating bodies, especially the SEC and Senate. ",37,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Senate  
Vietnamese Central Bank Bans Cryptocurrencies,Lisa Froelings,10/29/2017 14:27,33463,735,"Vietnam’s central bank, State Bank of Vietnam has declared the use of digital currencies in the country as illegal. The central bank also announced that it will impose a fine on anyone caught utilizing the cryptocurrencies starting early 2018.Based on the new monetary law issued by the bank that is scheduled to go into effect during the first quarter of 2018, Bitcoin and other virtual cryptocurrencies are already considered as illegal and their use will be prohibited in the country. The law also states that the only authorized payment methods in the country are those issued or controlled by the State Bank of Vietnam.The ban imposed by the State Bank of Vietnam comes at a time where Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, is setting record highs in trading markets. This is expected to affect the impact of the new law on the use of virtual currencies in the country. It is certain however, that the ban on virtual currencies will have little or no effect on individuals who want to use them in their transactions. The only thing the government can do is to launch a campaign against centralized companies using digital currencies.The decision by the central bank to declare cryptocurrencies as illegal is viewed as very unfortunate, as it stifles innovations in the financial sector. However, the law can be considered as a way by the government to emulate the actions of other countries around the world. It’s expected that this ban can be lifted in the future if the fears or apprehensions of possible scams involving the use of the digital currencies will be proven otherwise.",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Vietnam    #Banned Bitcoin    #Government  
"Another FUD String to JP Morgan Bow: Governments Will Ban Bitcoin, Mike Bell",Darryn Pollock,1/18/2018 11:50,33209,427,"In what looks like another well-timed attack out of JP Morgan, another one of their top men have made broad and sweeping statements against cryptocurrencies. Global Market Strategist Mike Bell has said that governments will eventually ban cryptocurrencies.The market is in a precarious space at the moment as confusion in Korea keeps people on edge with the uncertainty over a supposed ban.This is not the first time a JP Morgan man has timed its vitriol against Bitcoin in the wake of external factors. CEO Jamie Dimon said Bitcoin was a fraud in the wake of the China ban.Speaking to Bloomberg, Bell made some broad statements about Bitcoin and its potential to be a tool for nefarious acts, indicating that for this reason, globally, governments could look to blanket ban the entire market.“I think that’s the main problem with it. If you’re trying to avoid the government, ultimately it’s under threat from huge regulatory risk because there’s concern around money laundering and everything else.”“I think there’s a big risk from government’s banning these currencies eventually.”The globe has already seen some bans being affected by certain nations, none more so than when China made big news with its hardline approach to ICOs and exchanges.This upsetting of the market was aided by JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon leading a tirade against Bitcoin.At the moment, there is uncertainty in Korea about their stance on Bitcoin, and this new attack by a JP Morgan man seems a little too well timed.This position is also that of Bitcoin believer John McAfee who tweeted the following:Everyone Relax! The Crypto dip was caused by Mike Bell of JP Morgan claiming Governments could ban cryptocurrencies. Well ... how? This is the same company that called BTC a fraud. It's a bank FFS. They are rightfully terrified of what we are doing. But it can't be stopped.Even if Korea was to join the likes of China in trying to ban Bitcoin and others in their borders, it does not mean that they will ever really be able to lay the killing blow.A member of the board of Germany’s Bundesbank Joachim Wuermeling has called for this global front in regulating Bitcoin, but that will always be difficult.“Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited.”While it is easy to draw parallels between this FUD and Jamie Dimon’s, Bell did finish with a fair warning to investors.“I just think that investors should be very cautious looking these cryptocurrencies. You need to distinguish the technology underlying them in Blockchain and these cryptocurrencies which, unless they actually have some claim on a business, and are some kind of equities stake, are for all intents and purposes very hard to value.”“I think it would be very unwise to put any money that you can’t afford to lose into these currencies.”",23,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #JP Morgan    #Government    #Banned Bitcoin    #Jamie Dimon    #John McAfee    #China    #South Korea  
"At DC Hearing, Coinbase Calls Out Federal Regulators For ‘Harming Innovation’",Helen Partz,3/15/2018 1:16,33206,381,"The Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment considered the major questions associated with cryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in a recent hearing entitled “Examining Cryptocurrencies and ICO Markets” that took place in Washington DC on March 14.At the hearing, the Subcommittee discussed ICOs and cryptocurrency, the potential benefits for the economy, provision of legal support to its investors, and the development of a regulatory approach applied by the appropriate US regulatory bodies.In his testimony, Mike Lempres, Chief Legal and Risk Officer at Coinbase wallet and cryptocurrency exchange, stated that the power of the digital currency’s technology can transform “capital formation, innovation and economy,” saying that its “tremendous potential” can be only achieved through “responsible regulation.”However, at the current stage, the US regulatory system “is harming healthy innovation” due to a lack of understanding of what should be allowed and what should be not, and how digital assets should be considered; either as securities, commodities, property, or money.“There is so much uncertainty about the definition of a security and the scope of regulatory control that the market is being chilled. This is bad for everyone because the technology won’t stop?—?it will simply move overseas and we will miss out on the opportunity to cultivate the benefits in the U.S.”For Lempres, the goal is to ensure that potential benefits from new technology are not harmed by uncertainty resulting from ""regulatory or legal missteps.” Lempres provided a short review of the main US regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC)According to Lempres, the SEC, which is in charge of securities transactions, considers crypto as securities, while the CFTC who fully controls commodity derivatives transactions, claims that tokens are commodities. FinCEN has full authority for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) matters, and considers tokens to be money. Meanwhile, according to the IRS, the digital coins should be considered as property for tax treatment. According to Lempres, this constitutes an extreme “lack of coordination.”Answering a question from the Subcommittee chairman Rep. Bill Huizenga, Lempres stated that Coinbase cannot start supporting ICOs until the necessary regulations are adopted.“We do not support any [ICO] at the current time because we are not sure what the regulatory [treatment] is… We are waiting for the dust to settle between the CFTC and SEC before we electively engage on supporting ICOs.”",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA    #Investments    #Coinbase    #SEC    #CFTC    #IRS    #FinCEN    #Government  
Australian Tax Office To Crack Down On Crypto Tax Evaders,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/2/2018 15:57,33172,549,"The Australian Tax Office will be going after cryptocurrency investors to ensure they are accurately filing their crypto gains on their taxes this year, Business Insider Australia reported Feb. 28.The Australian Tax Office will use data matching and “100-point identification checks"" to track down crypto investors, as well as bilateral tax treaties and anti-money laundering commitments to get more information out of the traditionally anonymous crypto sphere and markets.Paul Drum, a member of the National Tax Liaison Group said that this move is a “watershed moment for the ATO” and would “[enable] them to access and thoroughly ­review cryptocurrency exchange account data for the first time:”“The effectiveness of the ­anonymity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is starting to fade. These coming changes mean that people shouldn’t ­assume they can hide forever behind Blockchain technology, nor should they ­assume there are no tax consequences.”In May 2017, the Australian government confirmed that it would treat Bitcoin “just like money,” and that it would no longer be subject to double taxation.The end of double taxation legislation was officially passed in September 2017, meaning that the goods and services tax (GST) would no longer be applied to both the purchase of the crypto and again for its use in an exchange. The Sept. 2017 legislation also says that crypto will be treated as fiat money for GST purposes, backdating the bill to July 1, 2017.However, in February 2018, the Australian Tax Office said that it considers cryptocurrencies as “property,” meaning that financial profits made from selling cryptocurrencies should be subject to a capital gains tax. The ATO has released a warning in late January that they will be taking “strong action” against those attempting to dodge their tax obligations.The ATO’s website contains a section on the taxation of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, where they said that in their view:“Bitcoin is neither money nor a foreign currency, and the supply of Bitcoin is not a financial supply for goods and services tax (GST) purposes. Bitcoin is, however, an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.”The section adds that there will be no income or GST tax for just paying for goods and services in BTC, as long as the cost totals less than $10,000. On the other hand, a business can be charged GST for goods and services with BTC transactions, and there is the possibility for a CGT to be applied if one “dispose[s]” of BTC as part of their business.Mark Chapman, H&R Block’s director of tax communications and former senior director at ATO, said that for those involved with cryptocurrencies, it’s best to seek professional tax advice due to the complexity of ATO guidelines, according to news.com.au:“A lot of people simply aren’t aware of their tax obligations — cryptocurrency is a wild west area with regards to tax — but it’s essential to be aware that there are potential tax obligations surrounding capital gains and income tax, depending on if you are investing or trading [...] you don’t want to fall foul of the tax man.”The German Federal Ministry said yesterday, March 1, that it would consider Bitcoin to be exempt from taxes as long as it is used as a means of payment.In the US, where the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has treated cryptocurrencies as property for tax purposes since 2014, only .04 percent of personal finance service CreditKarma’s customers reported cryptocurrency transactions on their tax returns this year.",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Taxes    #IRS    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government  
North Carolina Bill will be ‘Amended’ To Make BTC Businesses Comply,William Suberg,5/26/2015 19:18,248,0,"A bill placed before the North Carolina Senate could see the Old North State implement mandatory licensing for companies operating with digital currency.Lawmakers surrounding Bill H289, which passed the House earlier this month, say it is centered on security and consumer protection and aims to ensure companies adhere to know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.Local publication Citizen-Times cited Banking Commissioner Ray Grace, who called for legislation to be brought forward:“There’s two sides to the Bitcoin. One side is the clear potential value of the innovation, and what that could portent for the payment system. Since we're a business friendly state, we want to facilitate that [...]. We wanted to mitigate the risk while facilitating the potential benefits down the road.”The nature of the bill, in contrast to approaches seen in other US states, calls for an amendment to the Money Transmitters Act with Bitcoin businesses being treated as money transmitters. This, opponents say, runs counter to Bitcoin’s status at federal level, where it is currently not legally defined as money.A protest website, bitcoinregs.org, has been set up for those opposed to sign letters to the state lobbying for a revision of the proposals. Among other arguments, the letters reiterate that Bitcoin is currently classified as property, not money, by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).In a separate development, Bitcoin processor Coinbase last month issued a blog post supporting North Carolina’s “good” approach, calling it “a state that is promoting innovation and regulatory efficiency into its regulatory framework via the next generation of its Money Transmitters Act…”The post highlights the increased efficiency of the proposed scheme over New York’s BitLicense, requiring operators to obtain just one license per state if the model were to be adopted at a national level as North Carolina would not generate a separate licensing scheme just for digital currency businesses.Also supported is clarification of businesses’ right to hold “permissible investments” in digital currency, while Coinbase recognizes the state’s “sensible and flexible framework for consumer protection.”Nonetheless, with Coinbase having come in for criticism in recent months over its regulatory stance arguably being preserved at a cost to consumer privacy, it is clear that the community and industry remain divided over the US approach to facilitating expansion of digital currency. ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #North Carolina    #Digital Currency    #KYC    #Coinbase    #IRS    #Bills

This would mean that law enforcement agencies would have the effective use of all Uber users’ whereabouts while using the app.In an email to customers, Uber outlined the threat to privacy presented by the New York City government:“Today, New York City requires Uber and other companies to hand over a lot of sensitive personal passenger data, including where you're picked up on every trip. Now, New York City wants more. They're trying to force companies to tell them where you’re dropped off, as well.In other words, they want to piece together the full details of every trip you ever take. Several independent privacy experts have said this policy creates ""serious privacy risks."" And that it would give the government ""and anyone else who accesses this information a comprehensive, 360-degree view into the movements and habits of individual New Yorkers”.”Uber has already faced scrutiny from the US Congress for its detailed collection of location data, which, regardless of original intent, has now found its way into the hands of government officials.Facebook has also been subject to similar demands, having received a 27 percent increase in government requests for user data in the first half of 2016 alone.Virgil Vaduva, CEO of peer-to-peer emergency response and ride-sharing company Cell 411, sees the centralized model as presenting a risk for the abuse of customer data:“This abuse of users' confidential data is the little-known ugly side of centralized business models such as Uber, Facebook and most other Silicon Valley giants who, while being successful companies, show little regard for their users’ privacy.”While debate and controversy may swirl around tech companies’ use of customer data, newer, less centralized models offer a change of debate entirely by not collecting excessive user data, to begin with.By leveraging a more peer-to-peer approach in this way, large companies are simply not in possession of sensitive information in the event of a government body’s inquiry.According to Vaduva, whose app contains barebones ride-sharing functionality allowing for largely peer-to-peer arrangements between riders and drivers, empowering users to handle their own relationships allows the platform to stay out of their private business:“Unlike Uber, we do not even verify the identities of users using our platform, nor do we care about who our users are. Beyond making payments and honoring their ride agreements, Cell 411 users are not required to agree to any onerous data sharing policies and users' data is not shared with any third party nor mined by us or anyone else. Our entire infrastructure is based on a decentralized model which promotes horizontal, inter-user relationships and dynamic micro-social networks built by users in their own communities.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Uber    #New York    #Privacy    #P2P    #Government  
India Government U-turns on Banned 1000 Rupee Comeback,William Suberg,2/22/2017 16:04,233,105,"Indians continue to face cash shortages after a government U-turn means fewer new banknotes will enter into circulation than promised.Just a day after the central bank said the 1000-rupee note would reenter the economy after it was withdrawn in currency reforms three months ago, Secretary of Economic Affairs Shaktikanta Das stated there were “no plans” for reintroduction.No plans to introduce ?1000 notes. Focus is on production and supply of ?500 and lower denomination notes. Sources told Cointelegraph that the lack of notes in circulation is creating major problems as ATMs and other outlets run out of cash.Das added that the issue was “being addressed” but requested somewhat ironically that Indians only withdraw as much money as they need.“Enough cash is available,” he said.Enough cash available. Logistics issues of reloading ATMs more frequently being addressed. Cointelegraph reported Tuesday that the 1000 note was to make a comeback and that production was already in progress, although no date had been set for its reintroduction.Preference is now likely being given to smaller notes due to reports of difficulties getting change for transactions in India’s overwhelmingly cash-based economy.Meanwhile, Bitcoin usage in the country continues its steady trend upwards.

"Tilting at Windmills, Ukraine Bans Russian Payment Services Not Operating in Ukraine",Alicia Naumoff,11/10/2016 17:38,228,97,"Earlier this week, National Bank of Ukraine introduced a ban on the use of payment services provided by Webmoney, Yandex.Money, Qiwi Wallet and Wallet One.State authority explained that it was due to the fact that the rules of digital money use were not coordinated by the companies with the National Bank of Ukraine that their provision of their services was suspended.In this situation, service users are the ones affected the most as it will become impossible to pay for goods and services and withdraw money from eWallets operated by banned payment services providers. Cointelegraph contacted Qiwi and Yandex.Money for comments.Aleksander Dzhabarov, PR Manager at QIWI says to Cointelegraph:“We are really surprised about the fact that QIWI got into the list of banned payment services for one simple reason - company does not operate in Ukraine as of 2012.”“Yandex.Money operates around the world, at any place where there is Internet connection and according to the license issued by the Central Bank of Russia in compliance with the national regulations,” said the press secretary at Yandex.Money who shared the confusion with Cointelegraph.“However, we do not have any subsidiaries in Ukraine,” continues Yandex.Money spokesperson. “Unfortunately, we cannot constantly control how our services comply with legislation of countries where our services become popular. Every country has its own legislation, and playing by the rules is the responsibility of the citizens of these countries. Yandex.Money did not introduce any restrictions for service users from Ukraine.”According to the legislation of Ukraine, the issuing of digital money can be done only by the National Bank of Ukraine. Press office of the National Bank of Ukraine commented: “Taking into account the introduced measures, the National Bank of Ukraine has ordered banks and other financial institutions to stop provision of services of international payment systems created by the residents of the Russian Federation, to finalise reciprocal payments and return licenses for participation of institutions in international payment systems to the National Bank of Ukraine.”The recent measures are only a part of the national campaign for restricting of banks and financial institutions established by Russian residents on the territory of Ukraine.In late October a draft law on amendments to the regulation of banking activities was brought for a discussion at the Verkhovna Rada. The explanatory note attached to the draft law stated that Russia as the aggressor country, continues maintaining a significant impact on the Ukrainian economy and lives of citizens by keeping their companies and banks in the country.Garegin Tosunyan, the Head of the Association of Russian Banks, commented introduced measures as irrational and populistic. He said: “Financial industry requires pragmatic and positive approach. No investor would ever put his money to a bank of a certain country to cause harm to the national economy. Instead harm is caused by the immediate withdrawal of the capital from the economic system. In this regard, Russia and Russian financial institutions are acting in a more adequate way, since they do not withdraw their funds from the economy of Ukraine.”Russian banks and payment systems keep becoming a subject to extended national restrictions. The National Bank of Ukraine has ordered financial institutions to suspend all operations with Russian payment services providers. Payment system Colibri operated by Sberbank, Zolotaya Korona, Unistream, Anelik, and Blizko were among those systems banned in the country.Payment services provider WebMoney attracted attention of authorities already in 2013. At that time the national tax authorities visited offices of WebMoney and arrested company’s accounts that accumulated around 60 millions of Ukraine Grivna (around 6 million euro).",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Ukraine    #NBU    #Qiwi    #Yandex    #Russia    #Payment Services  
Operations With Bitcoin in Russia Do Not Entail Punishment. Yet.,Alicia Naumoff,8/15/2016 10:10,227,156,"Russian authorities refused the idea of introducing punishment for transactions with Bitcoin.For over two years Russian authorities could not make up their mind concerning the bizarre bitcoin. And now finally there might be some spark twinkling at the end of this tunnel as Russian authorities refused the idea of introducing punishment for transactions with bitcoin or other digital currencies.Earlier, the Ministry of Finance had suggested the introduction of imprisonment for a period up to four years for the use of a quasi-money, as Bitcoin and alike were labeled.Notably, managers of banks and other financial institutions would take a break for up to seven years in prison for operations with bitcoin, with subsequent deprivation of the right to take on the manager position.In June, Alexey Moiseev, Deputy Minister of Finance, said in a statement that the Ministry is revising and reconsidering the terms used in a draft law.State Prosecutor General’s Office and the Ministry of Justice agreed that there is no reason for introducing measures of criminal responsibility for trading with bitcoin. The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Russia supported this decision.The Ministry of Finance was ordered to revise the draft report addressed to the President and submit it by the end of the summer.At this point, bitcoin enthusiasts could start praising state authorities for not banning Bitcoin. Yet, there is one thing preventing them from breathing freely. Sale or purchase of cryptocurrencies are deemed currency transactions which should be reported to state tax services.The main tax authority of Russia has stated that transactions of purchase and sale of cryptocurrency (virtual currency) between residents and non-residents of the country, with the utilization of currency valuables and (or) currency of the Russian Federation, are, in fact, currency transactions.While Russian authorities still haven’t found a clear definition for bitcoin, they found a way to go around and put it inside the regulatory framework.Therefore, it does not really matter if bitcoin is a currency, a commodity, quasi-money or something else. As long as Russian tax residents exchange it to currency, it is regarded as a currency transaction that should be reported to tax authorities.The statement of the State Tax Authority is intended for informational purposes so far and does not imply making revisions and changes into current legislation. With Russian state authorities’ eagerness to ban and restrict things in the country, we are yet to see the destiny of this initiative.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia  
Jon Matonis: It's Becoming Obvious to Major Businesses That Adopting Bitcoin is a No-Brainer,Armand Tanzarian,7/28/2014 12:50,223,0,"Jon Matonis is the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a prominent cryptocurrency researcher and advocate, and columnist for Forbes and CoinDesk.We reached out to Matonis recently to get his thoughts on the foundation, BitLicenses and news about big companies such as Dell accepting Bitcoin payments.Cointelegraph: The Bitcoin Foundation has been criticized recently for being insufficiently transparent. What do you say to that criticism?Jon Matonis: [Editor’s note: The foundation’s head of marketing and communications first replied that Matonis and Gavin Andresen had both publicly responded to that criticism on Twitter here, here, here and here.]We are actually perplexed by the criticism. Mostly because it is so vague. As reporters, have you asked to clarify what “transparency"" even means in this context? Next week, we are launching our new website, which is way more easy to navigate. We're so excited it’s finally ready.- Jon Matonis with Maria Jones (Bitcoin2014, Amsterdam)CT: In your critique of the OECD’s working paper on Bitcoin, you noted the author fundamentally misunderstood the currency and thought it had to overtake legal tender to work. Why do you think so many people have trouble thinking of money as something other than legal tender?JM: It's very difficult for human beings to adopt new ideas. Especially in areas such as “legal tender.”By and large, most people don't know the history of money — that before government-backed paper money, ""money"" was anything that value could be attributed to and agreed upon by mainstream society. In our current times, we have not known any other era of ""money."" In the same way that credit cards have not been fully adopted by every generation, there will also be some generations that understand Bitcoin faster than others, and entire populations that may never bother even trying to understand.CT: What was your reaction to the news last week about Dell accepting Bitcoin?JM: This is great news for the industry. It's becoming more and more obvious to major businesses that adopting Bitcoin is a no-brainer.Not only does it offer the company a competitive advantage as an early adopter, it also issues early rewards in loads of free press as well as increased savings from costly transaction and banking fees. Companies like Coinbase and BitPay are doing excellent work in advancing consumer and merchant adoption, and we all win as a result of their efforts.CT: What about the other big news last week, the BitLicense regulations draft? What were some of your biggest takeaways from the NYSDFS’s proposed regulations?JM: It appears that New York's financial services regulator wants to make New York a Bitcoin-friendly state, and we welcome the goodwill. The next step would be for DFS to take seriously the comments it receives and make appropriate changes. Bitcoin is a financial innovation that is ripe for integration with conventional financial services.The first issue that stood out for us is the amount of time they are giving the community to respond. Forty-five days it the absolute minimum comment period required by the New York State Administrative Procedures Act. In New York, a regulatory proposal (which this is) does not expire until 365 days after being published or after the last scheduled public hearing.If New York was truly looking for public comment, would he be opposed to extending the comment period to the full 365 days, or some other period of time? Knowing full well that many of the Bitcoin players are small startups and can't afford to just drop what they are doing (building Bitcoin businesses, raising money, etc.) to comment intelligently within 45 days. Most entrepreneurs don't even have the funds to hire an attorney right now to do just that.Surely, New York can give the Bitcoin community the common courtesy in order to level the playing field for those startups that don't have millions in venture capital.NYDFS is also proposing to use an antiquated system for collecting comment. Since this is for the Bitcoin community, would they be willing to take our comments in a more modernized and organized fashion? Say using GitHub?Also, the proposed regulations single out Bitcoin businesses for different regulation than conventional financial service providers. That's not technology-neutral. As currently proposed, it also appears to sweep in software providers, which would be a perplexing and huge expansion of jurisdiction for the DFS. It would also create a new, Bitcoin-specific anti-money laundering program in New York, even though federal regulators already have a program in place that they feel is sufficient.For Bitcoin-based financial service providers, these proposed regulations treat Bitcoin as an ""impermissible investment,"" which means these businesses would absurdly have to convert their Bitcoin revenues into fiat money. If other states were to adopt the idea of a special ""BitLicense,"" that would increase already heavy burden of opening a US-based Bitcoin business.

The Russian Ministry of Finance one step closer to banning Bitcoin,Bogdan Ulm,8/2/2014 0:41,216,0,"Bitcoin, the first and the well-known cryptocurrency, has been a point of contention ever since it drew public attention in late 2013. Since it directly bypasses the established financial systems of sovereign nations, making a new form of virtual currency in a decentralized format accessible to anyone with a computer various countries, approaching it as an illegal commodity, have taken steps to curb its usage, often by citing its use in illegal contexts and thereby taxing it as foreign income or banning the cryptocurrency entirely. Other countries, however, have simply allowed it, justifying by noting Bitcoin's lack of usability as 'money' within their borders—in other words, that it isn't legal mean of payment.Back in April at the Moscow Bitcoin Conference, the general consensus of Russia’s Bitcoin community on the topic of Russia’s purported ‘ban’ on Bitcoin was that it is in fact a hands-off approach with many questioning the feasibility of regulating the new market. Many of economics' and politics’ most influential people were showing their skepticism towards Bitcoin and its role in Russian market.Sergey Belyakov, Deputy Minister of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, stated:“I don’t use it. But I know that our regulatory bodies, as far as I can tell, are reasonably skeptical towards this new system of payment. But I am open to any new ideas related to payment system and I don’t think that the inability to control is a strong argument for shunning this new system.”When asked about the reason for the so-called ban on cryptocurrencies, which the Central Bank of Russia justified due to their potential involvement in financing illegal activities, Belyakov added:“If there are particular issues with what kind of [illegal] transactions can be supported with such a payment system then this is a question of management, the effectiveness of control and the adaptation of regulatory bodies to emerging technologies. This has always been the case and you cannot stop the world from moving forward, new systems of payment included.”- Sergey BelyakovNow, the Russian Ministry of Finance wants to ban Bitcoin transactions. It proposes to limit not only the ‘substitutes’ of money, but also transactions with them, including their use as payment for goods and services.Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance proposes administrative and criminal punishment for the issue of money substitutes and transactions with their use. Also, the institution plans to restrict access to information sources, which produce Bitcoin and carry operations with their use, with the establishment of appropriate administrative sanctions, reports ""Interfax"".Up to now, the law is not yet officially published.  It is planned that the act can become effective in 2015. The initiators of the amendments claim that cryptocurrency attracts informal or even illegal economical sector. They are concerned that owners' names are hidden, and so-called Bitcoin gained popularity for possibility of buying with it illegal goods - therefore its legalization may stimulate crime.The additional materials to the law note that virtual money cannot have the status of a legal tender in any jurisdiction.According to the Ministry of Finance, use of ""money substitutes"" as a means of payment and savings may “infringe the rights of conscientious people”.  Institution claims that holders of ""money substitutes"" are unable to protect their interests in judicial or administrative order because of its anonymity and virtuality.First deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia Georgy Luntovsky in early July reported that the Bank of Russia is currently reviewing the situation with the development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Then he admitted that this issue is still under discussion:""In my opinion, we cannot reject these tools now. Perhaps the future will be based on them”.- Georgy LuntovskyIt brings to mind words of Arkady Dvorkovich, the ex-Assistant to the President of the Russian Federation under Dimitry Medvedev, who asserted in April that the topic of Bitcoin and its legal status is indeed a crucial issue, not easy to solve:“This is a question for the Central Bank. But with relation to surrogates or cryptocurrencies and how they will influence the economic situation as a whole - the monetary policy is, after all, relatively delicate with inflation etc. You must approach these issues carefully.""Russian Central Bank Admits “Bitcoin Might Have a Future”Russia Hosts First International and All Russian Bitcoin Conference in St. PetersburgLooking for the best applicant for your vacancy?

Thai SEC Tech Consultant ‘Hopes’ Authorities Will Reconsider Digital Asset Tax For ICOs,Helen Partz,4/19/2018 21:29,14222,57,"Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (Thai SEC) and Thai Fintech Associationtechnology consultant Bhume Bhumiratana, along with members of the local crypto community, have urged financial authorities to reconsider the country’s cryptocurrency tax framework, local news outlet Bangkok Post reported Tuesday, April 17.According to Thailand’s proposed crypto tax framework released in late March, the value added tax (VAT) for cryptocurrency trades would be 7 percent, while returns would be subject to a capital gains tax of 15 percent.  Bhumiratana expressed concern over the introduced crypto tax law’s treatment of tokens sold in Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). He stated that tax collection from ICO-issued tokens should be considered differently from digital assets in general “because digital tokens differ in terms of asset value."" The SEC consultant stated:""It is hoped that the Finance Ministry and the Revenue Department will consider issuing another law to delay the implementation of digital asset tax.""As reported by Bangkok Post, the introduction of the digital asset tax has provoked a strong negative reaction among local cryptocurrency business owners and enthusiasts, particularly among ICO issuers.Thuntee Sukchotrat, CEO at JIBEX cryptocurrency exchange, explained that the rights of investors should be approached with “financial and investment literacy” to allow local startups to raise funds from the Thai market. Otherwise, according to Sukchotrat, Thailand “will lose good ICO transactions to other markets.""Thailand’s government has taken an uncertain stance regarding cryptocurrency regulations previously, especially in terms of ICOs. In February, Thai crypto exchange Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX) paused ICO registrations awaiting the release of regulatory framework from the Thai SEC.Also in February, the central Bank of Thailand asked all banks in the country to stay away from cryptocurrency, advising the banks to ban customers from using credit and debit card to make crypto purchases, pending regulatory clarity. However, Thai Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong stated on Feb. 7 that the Thai government will not ban crypto trading, but will develop a crypto regulatory framework, as it is reportedly in the process of doing since last month.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Government    #Thailand    #Cryptocurrencies    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Taxes

Ripple Calls On UK Regulators To End “Wild West” Of Cryptocurrencies,Ana Alexandre,4/17/2018 1:45,29949,550,"The world’s third largest cryptocurrency Ripple, has called on UK regulators to follow the lead of Japan and end the “Wild West” days of cryptocurrency markets by implementing new rules, The Telegraph reported April 15.Ryan Zagone, Ripple’s head of regulatory relations, urged British regulators to find a balance between “capturing risk and enabling innovation”. Zagone pinpointed three principles for suggested regulation: consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and financial stability. He likened the existing normative framework on digital currencies to the early days of the Internet, saying:“We’re at that time now where we need more clarity and rules and we need more certainty. It’s a good time to start revisiting that ‘wait and see’ ­approach taken by regulators.”Zagone called Japan the “leader” of cryptocurrency regulation and legitimization and said other countries, including the UK, could use Japan’s experience as a blueprint. Australia followed Japan’s lead last year, declaring Bitcoin and other digital currencies legal tender in July 2017.It remains to be seen whether the UK will take their cue from Japan and revise its stance on cryptocurrencies, or continue to tighten regulations. Chancellor Philip Hammond launched a new taskforce last month to protect consumers, saying it will help “manage the risks around crypto-assets”.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that cryptocurrencies will face regulatory suppression, claiming they had “hallmarks of a bubble”. Zagone stated that regulation is necessary for the market to mature:“Regulation creates the guardrails on the highway that allows new entrants to come in, particularly institutional investors.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Cryptocurrencies    #UK    #Ripple    #Government

How Financial Instruments Help to Avoid Big Crypto Tax Bills?: Expert Take,Dashiell Shapiro,2/1/2018 12:55,29860,249,"In our Expert Takes, opinion leaders from inside and outside the crypto industry express their views, share their experience and give professional advice. Expert Takes cover everything from Blockchain technology and ICO funding to taxation, regulation, and cryptocurrency adoption by different sectors of the economy.If you would like to contribute an Expert Take, please email your ideas to a.mcqueen@cointelegraph.com.With the cryptocurrency economy now worth more than $500 bln, the IRS is waking up to massive tax revenues at stake. The IRS’s summons to Coinbase for their customer data is an early warning shot.  A wide-scale and coordinated IRS/ DOJ enforcement campaign is surely coming.Nobody likes paying taxes, but simply hoping the IRS won’t find out who owes what is a dangerous game.  Is there any hope for those that want to legally plan around cryptocurrency taxes, while hedging their substantial gains? There might be, but the wild card is how the IRS will approach these transactions.With the recent emergence of futures and options trading, it should become more commonplace for parties to design tailored cryptocurrency loans, swaps, forward contracts and more.  An explosion in cryptocurrency financial product innovation is coming. Whether this innovation is a blessing or a curse may depend on your perspective. What you can count on, though, is that the IRS will be lurking.What if I lend out my Bitcoin, either as a hedge, or to raise cash for other investments?  Do I need to pay tax on the cash I receive?  It’s a good question, and a lot of tax dollars are now at stake in some Bitcoin loans. The catch is that the IRS must agree that what took place is actually a loan. Simply calling it a loan is unfortunately not enough.Indeed, proper documentation and execution are essential. And even so, there can still be complications. For example, the IRS might say that the Bitcoin borrowed needs to be the same Bitcoin returned at the end of the loan term. Indeed, if I lend someone a painting, and they give me back a different painting, the IRS would probably say this was no loan at all. Rather the IRS could tax me as though I sold the first painting.It might sound silly for the IRS to take such a technical position on Bitcoin loans. Most everyone treats one Bitcoin as fungible with any other Bitcoin. And what would returning “the same Bitcoin” even mean?But with so much tax dollars at stake, some amount of posturing is to be expected from the IRS, and no argument is too technical for the taxman. The IRS has a variety of legal tools to attack a loan and claim it’s actually a sale.Another approach might involve a prepaid forward contract. The IRS has said that these transactions can work for publicly traded stocks if designed properly. In other words, they can allow parties to receive cash without triggering the tax.How do prepaid forwards work? Someone holding appreciated stock receives a fixed amount of cash up front (often 70-90 percent of the value of the shares). In exchange, the stockholder might agree to deliver a variable number of shares at a forward date (or an equivalent amount in cash), such as five years in the future. The idea is that title will transfer years later, so there’s no current tax now.So why not prepaid forward contracts for Bitcoin? Again, expect some pushback from the IRS.  How much pushback may depend on how the forward contract is documented. The more similar a Bitcoin forward is to a stock transaction the IRS has approved in the past, the better the chance it has to survive IRS scrutiny.But past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, especially in an IRS audit. Indeed, the IRS has attacked prepaid forwards that it considers abusive, such as where the shares were lent out over the course of the deal.As with loans, much may depend on how closely a Bitcoin forward contract tracks deals the IRS has already blessed. While the IRS is used to seeing prepaid forwards on IBM stock, they may be quick to poke holes in the cryptocurrency versions.  So again, plan carefully.The emergence of futures and options trading in Bitcoin is a potential game-changer for these transactions.  While they may not change the IRS’s mind about how to tax any particular financial instruments, they do offer market participants many more options.Only a year ago, finding a counterparty to take the opposite side in a Bitcoin loan or prepaid forward contract was no easy feat.  Now, institutional investors should be stepping in, not to mention cryptocurrency hedge funds.  A futures market offers bigger players a foothold and can allow them to reduce risk when taking the long or short side in a particular trade.Whether the IRS likes it or not, cryptocurrency financial instruments are here to stay. But, as with ICO’s, buyer beware is on order. Some innovations will create tremendous value, and allow parties to hedge effectively. Financial instruments can also help investors obtain targeted exposure to certain assets, which can’t be reached any other way.But with financial innovation comes risks, and it goes without saying that leverage can magnify those risks. If designed properly, financial instruments might offer a way for early adopters to lock in profits now and defer tax until later. Yet thoughtful planning is crucial, and the IRS is going to initially approach these transactions with skepticism (and, likely, some serious confusion). We should expect some interesting conversations.  Dashiell C.

South Carolina Wants To Ban Genesis Mining Over Unregistered Securities,William Suberg,3/12/2018 12:40,29128,355,"Lawmakers in South Carolina asked cryptocurrency cloud mining platform Genesis Mining to leave the state due to selling “unlicensed securities” Friday, March 9.A cease and desist order filed by the South Carolina Attorney General's Office Securities Division claims Genesis, which is registered in Hong Kong, along with Zurich-based partner enterprise Swiss Gold Global, illegally served residents with unregistered mining contracts.“At no time... was Swiss Gold Global registered with the Division as a broker-dealer, and no exemption from registration has been claimed,” the order reads.“At no time... were the securities at issue registered with the Division or federal covered securities.”The order marks the latest in a string of US state-level requests for various cryptocurrency actors to withdraw their services.

Japan: Crypto Group Merger For Self-Regulation Is ‘Not Fact’ Says Executive Director,William Suberg,2/16/2018 12:48,29123,163,"Japan’s two cryptocurrency industry groups will reportedly merge to form a legally-sanctioned self-regulatory body following talks held Thursday, Feb. 15.The Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) and Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) should become a singular entity from April 1, mainstream media suggest.The move follows demands from regulators that only one body make legal decisions, part of requirements which became law a year previously in April 2017 when Japan launched cryptocurrency exchange licensing.Commenting on the developments, JBA executive director Yuzo Kano highlighted that although “progress” had been made between the two groups, the merger was not yet finalized, contrary to reports in Nikkei and elsewhere.“The Association is genuinely consulting on integration with the JCBA for customer protection and industry development, and it is also true that there is progress, but it is not yet concrete fact,” he wrote on Twitter Friday.(??2)????????????????????JCBA?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????(???)A press statement from the JBA also reiterated no timeframe for the merger to take place had yet been agreed.The formalization of the industry represents a further step in allowing cryptocurrency to regulate itself in Japan, deciding its own parameters and becoming a bonafide area of the economy.Once formed, the umbrella body will be able to create rules and regulations for its members, including any penalties for flouting newly-approved regulations.Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported the South Korean government was also “actively considering” an exchange licensing scheme for its domestic businesses.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Cryptocurrencies    #Mainstream  
Bitcoin's Rollercoaster Ride is Starting to Get Scary,Darryn Pollock,11/27/2017 14:10,29038,270,"As Bitcoin skyrockets towards $10,000, having hovered around $800 in January this year, people are rejoicing and celebrating the wild ride. However, as the rollercoaster seemingly only continues ticking upwards, there have to be some nagging questions.Bitcoin has received more and more good news, especially when it comes to adoption. News about ETFs and Futures has attracted many Wall Street bankers, and all their institutionalized money flows into the digital currency realm.The ease and availability of Bitcoin is fueling adoption and that in turn is fueling the demand and price. Of course, this sparks the bubble argument up every time, but there are other things to be trepidatious about.This pace of growth seems unsustainable, but that does not mean it will pop, perhaps just slow down; and there are a few things to consider.The rumors of Bitcoin ETFs and futures started circulating recently, and while they have moved on from rumors to confirmed, they have not yet been moved to being active. There is still some teething that needs to be done for futures, but when the system is up and running, it may be time to “sell the news.”The whole idea of “buy the rumor, sell the news” is an adage rooted in the Bitcoin world and has proved itself a number of times. Now, when it comes to these easily accessible forms of Bitcoin buying - and selling - the market could well get a lot more liquid.Liquidity and the buying and selling that will come with these options will not cause any damage to Bitcoin at all. However, what it could do is stabilize the volatility, which is a double-edged sword. Lower volatility means a flattening out - no more big drops, but also no massive spikes.While Bitcoin came into this world quietly, with nothing else to cause it any competing issues, things have changed dramatically. Bitcoin has a whole lot of other coins to battle with; ICOs keep popping up creating more and more for the market but also eating into Bitcoin’s own market.Of course, many of these coins are a waste of time, and ICOs are not necessarily dilutive, but they will be enticing those who began with Bitcoin to try different things. Bitcoin Cash has been doing its bit to try and destabilize Bitcoin’s market, and such the money won’t all be pouring just into one coin.As Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market starts to make a bigger dent in the global economy, this unprecedented, unregulated digital currency will start to garner more and more attention from governments and regulators.There is no doubt that every country globally has heard of Bitcoin by now, but they are still divided as to what to do with the thing. There is a chance that as the price raises to these scary heights, the regulators could come smashing down.China has already made its move on Bitcoin regulation, crushing exchanges and ICOs. However, the market has shown very little mind to these kinds of moves, but the more other get involved, things may be slowed.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #Bitcoin Adoption    #ETF    #Government    #ICO  
SEC Director of Investor Education: ‘Don’t Flip A Coin’ Over Crypto Investments,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/23/2018 13:02,28618,311,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investor’s website published a light-hearted notice this week to all investors considering buying the “latest new cryptocurrency or token.”Lori Schock, the Director of the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, wrote an informal post aimed at the everyday retail crypto investor, beginning with an anecdote from a visit to a retirement home where she spoke with senior citizens about investing.According to Schock’s post, one senior citizen approached her after the lecture, asking:“My children keep telling me I need to hurry up and invest in bitcoin—is it safe, have I already missed the boat?”Schock’s light-toned post comes after a number of more serious statements from the SEC’s official website over the past year regarding the risks around Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and detailed testimony on the roles of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding virtual currencies.The SEC investor.gov post explicitly says that Schock’s post is not investment advice on cryptocurrencies, but advice for those considering beginning an investment in the crypto market.Schock underlines from the start how crypto investments do not fall under the SEC’s security protection laws, suggesting readers look at SEC Chairman Jay Clayton’s Dec. 2017 statement on crypto and ICOs for more information:“You should understand if you lose money there is a real chance the SEC and other regulators won’t be able to help you recover your investment, even in cases of fraud.”She then warns investors not fall for “high-pressure sales tactics” or to listen to celebrity endorsements as your basis for investment decision:“Just because your favorite celebrity says a product or service is a good investment doesn’t mean it is.”Schock’s note to investors about celebrity endorsements comes the same week that “Zen Master” Steven Seagal announced his brand ambassadorship with Bitcoiin2Gen, a new coin that markets itself as “not an MLM company or a Pyramid Scheme or any Scam.”Schock says that beginning crypto investors should “ask questions and demand clear answers,” about what exactly they are investing in, like “‘[w]ho exactly am I contracting with?’ and ‘[w]hat will my money be used for?’”She recommends not putting in more money than you are willing to lose, and diversifying your investments to spread the risk:“One way to spread risk is to diversify your investments.  Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. That way, if one of your investments loses money, the other investments can make up for it [...] Cryptocurrencies may be today’s shiny, new opportunity but there are serious risks involved [...] most importantly, don’t flip a coin when you’re making investment decisions.”",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #Investments    #Cryptocurrencies    #CFTC  
Morocco Outlaws Cryptocurrencies,Gareth Jenkinson,11/22/2017 15:25,17882,380,"Morocco has officially instituted a ban on transactions using cryptocurrencies, citing a lack of regulation as a ‘danger’ to users.According to an official press release on its Office des Changes website, the country’s foreign exchange regulator took a firm stance on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. A translation from French puts it simply:""Transactions via virtual currencies constitute a breach of regulations, punishable by penalties and fines.""The stance taken by the North-west African Kingdom’s regulator spells bad news for Morocco Trade and Development Services. The digital service provider had previously announced that it would accept payments in Bitcoin a week ago.The company has indicated that it will comply with the regulator’s ruling, but the company's founder Karl Stanzik believes the regulator will struggle to curb the use of virtual currencies in the country.Morocco’s Office des Changes insists that all payments to foreign countries need to go “through authorized intermediaries and with foreign currencies quoted by Bank Al-Maghrib,” which is its central bank.Like many emerging markets, the use of cryptocurrencies is steadily growing, with estimates that close to $200,000 worth of transactions are made with virtual currencies.Interestingly enough, the Moroccan exchange regulator said it would be watching the development of cryptocurrencies with a keen eye, alongside the Kingdom’s central bank and it’s associates.As more people, companies and institutions begin to use cryptocurrencies, governments and conventional financial institutions are forced to either take a hard line or legalize the use of virtual currencies.We’ve seen it happen in China and Vietnam - yet people find a way to continue trading, which in time leads to a change in perception of cryptocurrencies",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Morocco    #Banned Bitcoin    #Africa    #Tradings    #Transactions    #Banks    #Vietnam    #China  
Lebanese Central Bank Governor Criticizes Bitcoin as “Unregulated” Commodities,Lisa Froelings,10/29/2017 14:10,17843,281,"Lebanese central bank Banque du Liban (BDL) Governor Riad Salameh has claimed that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are “unregulated” commodities whose use should be prohibited. He also said that digital currencies will be ineffective as national currencies because they are just “commodities.”At the opening ceremony of the 7th Corporate Social Responsibility Lebanon Forum in late October 2017, Salameh told participants that the BDL prohibited the use of the cryptocurrencies across Lebanon due to their nature resembling that of commodities. He further claimed that money will eventually be digitized in the future.""These [Bitcoin] are not currencies but rather a commodity whose prices rise and fall without any justification. For this reason, BDL has banned the use of this currency in the Lebanese market. We understand that electronic currency will play a prominent role in the future. But BDL must first make the necessary arrangements before taking this step and develop [a] protection system from cybercrime.”At the forum, Salameh also announced the plan by the central bank to introduce its own digital currency. He, however, did not reveal whether the currency will be based on Blockchain technology, which is behind Bitcoin and the other virtual currencies. It is possible that BDL will utilize other forms of technology to create a centralized digital currency in Lebanon as is being done by other countries.Independent countries such as Ecuador and Sweden are studying the possible use of other technologies in creating their own digital money. Other nations like China are studying the use of Blockchain for their own digital currencies.Salameh has not provided a timeline on when the central bank will launch its digital currency.

"Bitcoin is Not A Tool For Illegitimate Transactions, Says Quebec Chief Scientist",Aaron Wood,4/19/2018 23:13,16946,111,"The Chief Scientist of Quebec Rémi Quirion says public concern that Bitcoin is being used for illicit activities like tax evasion and money laundering is largely overblown, Forbes reports April 18.The statement prepared by the l’Agence Science-Presse, which is a partner of Fonds de Recherche du Québec, said, “Bitcoin is not above the law, nor is it a magnet for illicit transactions: it forms only a tiny part of the criminal money circulating around the planet.”They add that the transparent and public nature of the Bitcoin Blockchain, where transactions are recorded and distributed across a global network, is not an ideal platform for engaging in anonymous criminal activity.“The anonymity of Bitcoin is a myth, [it] is no more transparent as money, because you have to go through a platform where you have to give personal information. At the limit, if the name is not his, we always know the address of the transmitter and that of the receiver.”The statement cites a study from the Center for Sanctions and Illicit Finance of the Defence of Democracies Foundation, stating that “dirty Bitcoins” only represent 0.61 percent of trade and conversion services between 2013 and 2016. The largest proportion in the targeted period was 1.07 percent.Geneviève Bruno of the Quebec provincial police, Sûreté du Québec, said that money laundering via Bitcoin is “not an emergent phenomenon here and we do not have any records related to that.”The agency also characterizes allegations of tax evasion via Bitcoin as “anecdotal” adding:“Most users do not have the skills for themselves [to] manage their portfolios and exchange platforms or online portfolios are already subject to anti-money laundering rules...Since Bitcoin is transparent, it will be very easy to identify all the people trading on an online exchange or portfolio platform.""While the statement largely refutes allegations of Bitcoin as a tool for criminals, it does urge investors in Bitcoin to remain cautious and exercise due diligence, adding that the ultimate responsibility falls upon the user.Last month, the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, TMX Group, announced that one of its subsidiaries had entered into a partnership to open a cryptocurrency brokerage firm in Canada.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Canada    #Government    #Adoption  
"French Watchdog Says ‘Crypto Derivatives’ Must Be Regulated, Can’t Be Advertised Online",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/22/2018 15:10,16785,198,"French stock market regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) released a statement Thursday, Feb. 22, that cryptocurrency derivatives must be regulated under the European Union’s new Jan. 2018 financial reforms.As derivatives cannot be legally advertised electronically, the AMF also states that online advertisements for cryptocurrency derivatives are not permitted.AMF refers to the new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID 2), whose framework lays out the derivatives that must be regulated, like options, futures, swaps or forwards, as well as a list of corresponding underlying assets.The AMF began an inquiry into the legal definition of a cryptocurrency as both a derivative and an underlying asset after several online crypto trading platforms began offering binary options, contracts for difference (CFD), and Forex contracts where cryptocurrency was the underlying asset. Investors could bet on the outcome of a cryptocurrency without owning any of cryptocurrency itself.Although cryptocurrency derivatives are not included in the MiFID 2 regulation list, the AMF statement has concluded that “a cash-settled cryptocurrency contract may qualify as a derivative, irrespective of the legal qualification of a cryptocurrency.”Online trading platforms offering cryptocurrency derivatives must be regulated under MiFID2 and cleared under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Cryptocurrency derivatives also fall under the jurisdiction of France’s anti-corruption Sapin 2 law, according to the AMF statement.Bloomberg writes that companies Plus500 Ltd. and IG Group Holdings Plc. have offered such cryptocurrency derivatives. Kelsey Traynor, a spokesperson for Plus500, told Bloomberg that all of the firm’s CFDs are in accordance with the AMF’s framework.In December 2017, France allowed fintech companies and banks to trade unlisted securities on Blockchain-based platforms as a way to promote France’s reputation as a fintech hub.France’s Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire appointed Jean-Pierre Landau, or “Monsieur Bitcoin,” in January of this year to head a cryptocurrency task force aimed at preventing criminal activity with crypto.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #France    #Markets    #EU  
Russia: Municipal Court In St. Petersburg Rules To Unblock 40 Bitcoin-Related Websites,Helen Partz,3/1/2018 0:45,16620,222,"The Municipal Court of Russia’s second largest city, St. Petersburg, annulled a trial court’s previous decision to ban 40 Bitcoin-related websites in the Russian Federation, local news outlet RIA Novosti reported Tuesday, Feb. 27.In July 2017, the Oktyabrsky District Court of St. Petersburg granted the application of the St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office and ruled to block 40 Bitcoin-related websites.Earlier in March 2017, St. Petersburg prosecutors filed a lawsuit to ban websites such as Bestchange.ru and 24paybank.com because they were “spreading information” about digital currency that “is not backed by any real asset and does not provide information about its owners.”As a result, the Oktyabrsky District Court decided to ban 40 websites based on the argument that:“Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are a money substitute contributing to the growth of the informal economy, and cannot be used by citizens and legal entities in the Russian Federation. The free flow of information about digital currencies implies active use of cryptocurrencies in trafficking illicit drugs, illegal weapons, forged documents, and other criminal activities.”On Tuesday the Municipal Court of St. Petersburg reviewed the appeal filed by the Moscow-based Digital Rights Center, and annulled the decision. According to a press service representative, a different body of the court will convene to consider the case.The same day, Feb. 27, Bill Gates caused a stir on Reddit when he claimed that cryptocurrencies are used to buy illegal drugs and have “caused deaths in a fairly direct way.”Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that the creator of cryptocurrency PRISM, Yury Mayorov, was kidnapped in Moscow and robbed of 300 bitcoins, roughly $3 mln at press time, as well as $20,000 and three iPhones.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Government    #Censorship  
Not Right Time to Regulate Bitcoin: American Institute For Economic Research,Joseph Young,5/29/2017 18:25,16546,427,"The American Institute For Economic Research (AIER) senior research fellow Max Gulker argued in a recent column entitled “Now Is Not the Right Time to Regulate Bitcoin” that it is not a practical approach towards technological innovation to overregulate Bitcoin and digital currencies at the moment.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic and NEM are all at its early stage in development. Bitcoin is yet to deal with its scaling issues that have substantially increased transaction fees for users.Bitcoin fee estimation service providers including the 21 Inc Bitcoin Fees are recommending users a $2 fee or a 420 satoshis per byte fee to have transactions verified and confirmed by miners relatively fast.Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies and Blockchain networks are also dealing with their own scaling issues and developing infrastructures for their growing user base and clientele. Ethereum and Ripple, in particular, are in partnership with some of the world’s largest financial institutions and conglomerates to utilize smart contracts to settle transactions in an autonomous, transparent and secure manner.Hence, at this critical juncture, it would be significantly impractical for governments to step in and overregulate the cryptocurrency sector. Minimal and efficient regulatory frameworks have helped the global cryptocurrency market to mature. For instance, Japan’s legalization of Bitcoin led to an explosive growth in demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ripple and NEM.However, Gulker explained that regulatory frameworks such as New York’s BitLicense can be damaging to startups both financially and in the technical sense. As regulatory frameworks like the NY BitLicense require startups to pay a large licensing fee and keep tight records of their users, they create difficult ecosystems for both small and large-scale startups.Even startups that have millions of users and that have secured millions of early-stage funding such as Shapeshift have suspended services in New York due to impractical regulations.Emphasizing the damage over-regulation from governments can inflict on startups and the global cryptocurrency industry, Gulker wrote:”Cryptocurrencies are still in a very early period of innovation and adoption. It would be a shame for a disproportionate amount of that innovative effort to go toward satisfying regulators’ demands rather than users’ wants and needs. The true risk lies in over-regulating cryptocurrencies now.”Ultimately, Gulker noted that governments should take a wait-and-see approach instead and implement the practical yet minimal regulation on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry. When the technology, market and industry start to evolve, governments can step in to regulate the market for general consumers and investors.“Those who believe in the benevolent power of such regulation should remember the inevitable rent-seeking behavior to which it leads, where businesses lobby government for favorable regulation. So it might be best for regulators to take a wait-and-see approach,” added Gulker.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Fees  
Not All Doom and Gloom for Chinese Bitcoin Miners,Gareth Jenkinson,1/10/2018 13:20,35826,280,"Even amid future regulatory constraints, Chinese Bitcoin miners could withstand a massive market crash due to the low electricity costs in the country.According to Bloomberg, China’s thriving Bitcoin mining industry would still be highly profitable if Bitcoin price were to drop to $7,000.Bitcoin price shot up from $1,000 in January 2017 to a record high of $20,000 in December, which of course demanded more miners and inevitably more energy.China has long been a cash-cow for Bitcoin miners, due to a surplus supply of energy leading to low power cost.Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) analysts published a report on Jan. 10 stating that mining operators in China could still turn a profit if Bitcoin price is anywhere above $6,925.According to analyst Sophie Lu, mining will almost always be profitable in China:“Bitcoin mining under the current price is likely to be profitable under any electricity price regime in China.”Following a closed-door meeting in December, there is talk of mining operators facing power restrictions in certain regions of China, where there is higher electricity usage. But this latest analysis suggests that it’s not all doom and gloom for China’s biggest mining operators, including the likes of Bitmain, BTCC, BW mining and BTC.com.While power surveys have cited the massive power demand of the global Bitcoin mining industry, China’s operators are by far the biggest.However, BNEF’s statistics highlight the true scale of the country’s mining industry in comparison to the overall electricity supply. China’s miners use 15.4 terawatt hours of power, which amounts to 0.2 percent of the country’s annual electricity production.The highest electricity rate for Chinese miners is $0.13 per kilowatt-hour. However, as Lu reports, operators can negotiate prices down to as low as $0.03 - meaning miners would be profitable as long as the Bitcoin price stays above $3,869.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Mining    #China  
Tax Authorities In Pakistan Zero In At Bitcoin Traders,Jacob J,5/31/2017 10:49,35761,466,"Tax authorities across the globe have set their sights on Bitcoin traders. The latest to join the set is the FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) in Pakistan.While Asian countries like Japan, China and South Korea have been in the news for people taking a fancy to Bitcoin, adoption in Pakistan has been low key.The first Bitcoin exchange in Pakistan, Urdubit, was established in 2014. There is tremendous potential for Bitcoin in Pakistan, with the country receiving remittances of $20 bln every year. Pakistan also has a vibrant freelance economy, with estimated revenue of $1 bln.Wider adoption of Bitcoin can bring efficiencies in both remittances and payment for online freelancing.The recent rapid increase in Bitcoin price has meant that Bitcoin investors were able to reap windfall profits. Not all of them declare this income, resulting in scrutiny from tax authorities.In the US, the IRS served a John Doe summons to Coinbase, asking it to hand over details of US customer transactions. The IRS had sought details of customer transactions between 2013 to 2015, much before the current bull rally.In Pakistan, the volume of Bitcoin transactions has recently increased, leading to the intelligence department of the FBR launching an investigation.The objectives of the FBR are two-fold – detect cases of tax evasion as well as money laundering. According to tax officials, major traders of Bitcoin have not reported their business profits to tax authorities and hence a summons has been issued.The State Bank of Pakistan does not recognize cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are traded as commodities and the government has not shown any indication that it would either regulate or impede cryptocurrency transactions.The focus of the current government action seems to be restricted to cracking down on cases of money laundering and tax evasion. The government will find it tough to restrict its people from purchasing a deflationary currency when the average rate of inflation in Pakistan during the last 60 years is 7.8 percent.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Pakistan    #Tradings    #Bitcoin Price

Undisclosed sources told WSJ that the regulatory agency has a currently unknown number of subpoenas and information requests to advisers and technology companies active in the United States’ cryptocurrency market.Among the subpoenas from the top US securities regulatory agency are demands regarding the structure for sales and pre-sales for ICOs, which do not fall under the same rigorous scrutiny of public offerings. The increased pressure follows previous inquiries from the SEC, which have suggested that many token sales and ICOs may be violating securities laws.Earlier this month, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton promised increased scrutiny on companies who seek to “capitalize on the perceived promise” of an increased stock value following an announcement of investment in cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology. The SEC has come down on several companies recently, suspending the activities of some due to unclear associations with cryptocurrency and crypto business.While US federal agencies grow more suspicious of crypto business, at the state level, legislation is being introduced and passed that would relax certain controls on cryptocurrencies.The state of Wyoming is taking a particularly laissez-faire approach to cryptocurrency regulation, passing a law that completely exempts tokens from securities regulations if they meet a short list of requirements. Wyoming also introduced a bill earlier this month that, if passed, would exempt cryptocurrencies from property taxes, per its current status under US tax law.The state senate of Arizona has passed a bill that authorizes cryptocurrencies to be used for paying state taxes and license fees.

If the government is now taking on board public opinion it would appear that they are about to take a stand on the matter.According to the government of India portal, one of the questions that the Indian government is asking the public is whether Bitcoin and other Virtual Currencies (VCs) should be banned, regulated or controlled.In a post made on the government website, the government of India wants to know from people if virtual currencies are to be regulated what measures should be taken to ensure consumer protection and what measures should be taken to promote ‘orderly’ development of such currencies.The government is also asking the question which institutions should be involved in the monitoring and regulating of VCs.Interestingly the government is also asking that if these currencies are not regulated than what should be the effective self-regulatory mechanisms and what measures should be adopted to protect consumers in a self-regulated arena.In March of 2017, the government of India has already constituted an Interdisciplinary Committee which is chaired by the Special Secretary for Economic Affairs.On board, it has representatives from the Department of Economic Affairs, Department of Financial Services, Department of Revenue (CBDT), Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Reserve Bank of India, NITI Aayog and the State Bank of India.From the constitution of this committee, it can be guessed that the government is pretty much serious on examining the status of Bitcoin and other currencies in the country.At the moment the Bitcoin industry in India is pretty much self-regulated. However, there has been interest in the legal status of Bitcoin in India, which has been building over time.We covered in April 2017 how Assocham, one of the oldest and largest trade bodies in India has held a ‘global summit’ which was on the topic of Bitcoin’s status in India. We had also covered the news of the efforts of various Bitcoin players in the country coming together to form the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI) in order to self-regulate the industry.There are a number of positives that can be construed from this latest development in India. One is that the government is finally moving towards taking some sort of stance on Bitcoin, whether positive or negative.The second is that there are a lot of positive comments being left on the government portal by common Indian citizens.Take for example Deep Sharma who writes:“Legalize Bitcoin in India like other countries, it's was a good step for our economy and provide a boost to the economy or increase GDP rate.”Bisnuram Kramsa writes:“Cryptocurrency is the future currency so we have to regulate Bitcoin.”It would appear that a Bitcoin-related legal framework will be in place in India sometime in the future. How soon and what shape it will take, only time will tell.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Cryptocurrencies    #Digital Currency  
Member Of China’s Main Political Advisory Proposes National Crypto Trading Platform,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/5/2018 11:17,34648,611,"A member of China’s top political advisory board has proposed the creation of a national cryptocurrency exchange and other regulatory systems at one of the two annual sessions of China's top legislative and advisory bodies, local news outlet Lie Yun Wang reported on March 3.Wang Pengjie, ? member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), suggested that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) should create a Blockchain and digital asset management “approval system,” as well as raised the possibility of establishing a digital asset trading platform at a national level.Pengjie’s remarks come after a recent string of crypto bans from China, from blocking foreign exchanges to the September 2017 ban of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).Pengjie brought up the rising total market capitalization of digital assets like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Litecoin (LTC), noting the fact that their market caps exceeded that of China’s biggest Internet provider Tencent in January 2018 as a reason for China to pay attention to Blockchain-based technologies. He also mentioned South Korea’s crypto regulations, and the fact that the US Nasdaq is considering trading in Bitcoin futures as other impetuses.Pengjie did mention the issues that working with Blockchain brings up for China, first stating that the “lack of mature independent intellectual property rights [...] will not be good for China's financial security in the long run.” He also referenced the lack of clarity surrounding the legal status of cryptocurrencies as well as the lack of consumer knowledge that could “easily” lead to fraud by “unscrupulous elements dressed in 'Blockchain' garments, causing serious economic losses.”A possible solution to these problems, according to Pengjie, is the creation of the aforementioned “approval system,” as well as implementing a “real name” system certification in conjunction with thoroughly educating investors on Blockchain and virtual currencies.Pengjie also suggested establishing a national Blockchain digital asset trading platform, jointly regulated by the PBOC and CSRC:“Thus we can provide a formal channel for companies to raise funds and for individual investors to achieve capital appreciation.”The CSRC had signed a deal of financial technology cooperation with Australia in November 2017, aimed at promoting fintech innovation between the two countries. The PBOC’s ban of foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, on top of the other ICO and “exchange-like service” restrictions, in part led to Bitcoin dipping below $7000 in early February, for the first time since November 2017.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Peopleâ€™s Bank of China    #China    #Litecoin    #ICO    #South Korea    #Government    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
"Israel Confirms Cryptocurrency Will Be Taxed As Property, Not Currency",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/20/2018 11:57,34551,637,"The Israeli Tax Authority (ITA) confirmed yesterday, Feb. 19, in a professional circular that the country will tax cryptocurrencies as property.The tax authority had released a draft of today’s circular on Jan. 12, which referred to virtual currencies as “unit[s] used for barter [that] can be used for investment purposes.” Per this definition:“these currencies will be considered as ‘assets’ and will be sold as a ‘sale’ and the proceeds from their sale will be classified as capital income.”The final version of the circular writes that crypto will be taxed by the capital gains tax, which in Israel will be 25 percent for private investors, with a 47 percent marginal rate for businesses, according to Israeli news outlet Haaretz.The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been taxing cryptocurrencies as property since March 2014.Israel’s general consumption value-added tax (VAT) will not be added for individual investors, as crypto is considered an “intangible asset” used “for investment purposes only”, but businesses will have to pay VAT, the circular notes. The document also states that miners will be classified as “dealer[s]” for VAT purposes.Shahar Strauss, a lawyer at the Israeli law firm Ziv Sharon & Company, doesn’t agree with the new crypto property tax definition, Haaretz reports:“The [agency’s] stance ignore economic realities. According to the Tax Authority, investing in the esoteric currency of some Pacific island that can’t be used in Israel and many other countries meets the definition of currency and is therefore entitled to a tax exemption, while investing in digital currency is not.”In January, the Israeli tax authority had also released a draft circular considering the methods of taxing Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) with VAT. This week’s circular does not make any mention of decisions regarding ICOs taxation.Israel’s government has been considering releasing their own cryptocurrency, a digital shekel since December 2017, as one possible means to limit black market transactions within the country.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Israel    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #ICO  
South Korea Considers Adopting Crypto Exchange Licensing System Like NY’s BitLicense,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/13/2018 19:17,34530,469,"South Korea is considering adopting an approval system for crypto exchanges based on New York’s BitLicense system, local news outlet BusinessKorea reports.BusinessKorea writes that it is unlikely any final decision will be made until after the June 2018 elections in the country. A government official spoke to them about the option as part of a virtual currency taskforce:“We are positively considering the adoption of an exchange approval system as the additional regulation on cryptocurrencies. We are most likely [to] benchmark the model [against that] of the State of New York that gives a selective permission.”BitLicense is a license to operate a virtual currency exchange given by the New York State Department of Financial Services, put into operation in August 2015. Japan has a similar exchange license program, where its Financial Services Agency (FSA) approves licenses for crypto exchanges that have met a stringent set of requirements on everything from customer accounts to computer systems.The consideration of an exchange approval system in South Korea comes as the crypto markets have become less “overheated”, according to BusinessKorea. The publication reports that the South Korean government sees the more stable prices of crypto, compared to the high and low swings of December and January, as a cooling off of speculation.A different unnamed government official said:“Some even say that the government should impose taxes instead of putting additional regulations if the market volatility remains same at the current level. We will hold a meeting to respond to [the] national petition related to digital currencies this month but we are highly likely to make up for the defects of existing measures only at the meeting.”The petition the official is reffering to, which calls for less regulation on cryptocurrency in the country, received over 200,000 signatures from the South Korean public in Jan. 2018, demanding a government response.South Korea has been all over the crypto news recently, since a misinterpreted rumor of a total crypto ban in the country caused the markets to fall sharply early this year. CoinMarketCap also removed South Korean exchanges from its listing in early January due to what it saw as an “extreme divergence in prices” from rest of the world’s crypto markets.According to a study reported on by Cointelegraph, over a third of salaried Koreans hold around $5000 in crypto, while 80 percent of South Korean investors have made profits from crypto investments.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Markets    #BitLicense    #Japan    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Cryptocurrencies    #CoinMarketCap  
South Korea’s Cryptocurrency Exchanges Made ‘$648 mln’ Taxable Revenue For 2017,William Suberg,2/19/2018 15:00,34033,314,"The Upbit exchange generated more than half of South Korea’s $648 mln cryptocurrency exchange revenues in 2017, new government figures claim.According to data released by lawmaker Park Kwang-on and reported by local news media outlet Yonhap News Sunday, total revenues for Korea’s burgeoning exchange sector ballooned 8025% compared to 2016, when it amounted to just $7.5 mln.Exchanges enjoyed a lively and competitive market for most of last year, before the South Korean government began threatening restrictions and even an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading beginning in December.As the environment begins to settle and regulations become enacted, the aftermath of new tax obligations for exchanges for 2017’s bumper year continues.In January, lawmakers demanded exchanges pay both corporate tax and a local income tax amounting to just over 24% of revenues earned during the period in question.Upbit appears in line to take the biggest hit with its 52.9% market share in 2017, with Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit following in second, third and fourth places respectively.Bithumb, which hit the headlines last year due to security lapses and this month for its prestigious partnership with online shopping mall WeMakePrice, accrued 317.7 bln won ($297 mln) in commissions.According to government directives, all due payments must occur by the end of March for the corporate tax and the end of April for the local income tax.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Taxes  
Wyoming Introduces New Bill To Exempt Crypto From Property Taxation,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/19/2018 21:41,33955,750,"A new tax bill has been introduced in the Wyoming state senate on Feb. 16 that would exempt virtual currencies from state property taxation, and suggests an effective date be provided for the tax exemption implementation.Wyoming Senate Bill 111 was introduced by senators Ogden Driskill, Tara Nethercott, and Chris Rothfuss, along with representatives Tyler Lindholm, David Miller, and Jared Olsen. All are Republicans with the exception of Senator Rothfuss.The bill received 26 “ayes,” from a mixture of Republicans and Democrats, 3 “nays,” all from Republicans, and 1 “excused.”This Republican and Democratic backed bill comes as a growing bipartisan movement of US lawmakers are calling for more crypto regulation.The bill is short and to the point, proposing a list of “intangible items” that should qualify for property tax exemption, like fiat currency, gold, cashier’s checks, and “virtual currencies.” Virtual currencies are defined as anything that digitally represents value as a medium of exchange or unit of value, and as well as not being recognized as legal US currency.Taxation requirements for cryptocurrency profits in the US are a relatively grey area, with US citizens’ crypto assets being subject to federal property and payroll taxes. However, the personal finance service Credit Karma reported that only 0.04 percent of customers reported their crypto assets to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2017 as of Feb. 13.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taxes    #USA    #Government  
U.S Judge Upholds Vote To Confiscate Family’s $80mln Gold Coins,William Suberg,6/15/2017 11:11,12536,445,"The family who found ten gold coins allegedly worth $80 mln has again lost the battle to stop the US government confiscating them. Acc Mag reported on Wednesday June 14 that Judge Legrome Davis of the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania upheld the position of the state: the coins originally belonged to the state, therefore the discoverers would not be offered compensation.The story is a timely reminder about the lack of control over state-issued means of exchange in an age where decentralized assets are flourishing. Ten 1933 Saint-Gaudens double eagle coins were found by the Langbord family, descendants of a U.S cashier, locked in a safety deposit box.Originally coined by the Philadelphia Mint, most were destroyed when the US abandoned the gold standard. However, the few that have slipped through the net have fetched huge sums; in 2002 an identical coin went for $7.5 million at auction.Nevertheless, when the cache was handed over to the Mint for verification, lawmakers said that they were originally illegally removed from circulation and therefore still belonged to the state.The Langbords have appealed the original decision from 2011 several times without success, yet will continue to challenge the ruling after their latest setback.Cryptocurrency’s rise has seen attempts to increase state control of its value in recent months. The European Union, for example, is attempting to pass legislation obliging wallet holders of Bitcoin and other assets to link these to their real identity.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Gold    #USA  
"Russia Considers Ban On Tor, VPN Networks",William Suberg,6/9/2017 9:55,12208,357,"Russia’s state parliament the Duma is considering banning VPNs if they do not agree to block access to online content blocked by the government.As reports Russian local news media, deputies are considering giving access to the state register of banned websites and obliging VPN operators to block them.The state communications regulator Roskomnadzor would be responsible for instigating the plans, which are currently at the first level of consideration.“Should they refuse, the authors of the bill would impose a 30-day ban on such services,” Lenta reports.Separate initiatives are targeting mirror sites of those banned, as well as search engines of any sort, which would be required to remove certain content from results presented to Russian users.Roskomnadzor routinely blocks websites for Russian IP addresses, yet this often appears haphazard in its implementation, with sites disappearing and reappearing at random intervals.Last year, popular cryptocurrency resource Localbitcoins was able to circumvent its ban in Russia using the Localbitcoins.net mirror site, something which in future might theoretically no longer be possible.The country has reversed its stance on cryptocurrency itself recently, going from suspicious to supportive in a matter of months.The bill’s creators also made reference to the Tor browser, arguing the methods of banning content nowadays were “ineffective.”It is not understood how lawmakers would go about imposing a ban on Tor itself.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Tor    #VPN    #Localbitcoins    #Government  
"Russian Officials Propose Lighter ICO Regulations, Cryptocurrency Income Tax Breaks",Helen Partz,3/2/2018 13:34,15150,345,"Russian officials have considered a number of amendments to the draft law “On Digital Financial Assets” during a meeting of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation that took place Feb. 27.The major modifications proposed by the officials include a digital currency assets income tax break and a tenfold increase of the limit on individual Initial Coin Offering (ICO) investments - from the initially suggested 50,000 rubles, or about $900, to 500,000 rubles, equivalent to about $9,000.The working group also suggested that Russian investors in digital assets should be allowed to open accounts on foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as to buy ICO tokens from abroad. Similarly, non-residents should be allowed to invest in Russian ICO projects, the officials have argued.The meeting included representatives from Russia’s Ministry of Communications and Mass Media (Minkomsvyaz) that earlier published a document establishing the rules for ICO projects.Also attending were the Russian Ministry of Justice, the Central Bank, the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS), and others. Their proposals will be further reviewed by the dedicated Government Commission.The Ministry of Finance (Minfin), which actually issued the draft law “On Digital Financial Assets” on Jan. 25, 2018, did not take part in the meeting.Recently, the Moscow Arbitration Court has ruled to exclude digital currencies from assets that can be seized for debt payment citing as reason the fact that cryptocurrencies remain legally undefined in Russia.As reported by Cointelegraph auf Deutschland on Thursday, Mar. 1, German authorities have made a similar decision to exempt cryptocurrency transactions from taxes when they are used as a means of payment.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #ICO    #Taxes    #Government    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
"Suddenly, Europe is Starting to Become Bitcoin Haven",Joseph Young,4/24/2017 17:45,15008,1066,"Countries like France, Germany and the UK have already established regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin companies, users and traders. Other European countries have offered their unique regulatory frameworks with clarity, to ensure there exists no conflict between local businesses and regulators due to ambiguous regulations and policies like India.Smaller countries such as Malta, an archipelago in the central Mediterranean between Sicily and the North African coast, have begun to consider Bitcoin as a legitimate currency and revolutionary technology.In particular, local publications including Malta Today reported that the country’s prime minister Joseph Muscat announced the approval of a national strategy to promote Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.Muscat said at a conference organized by the financial affairs parliamentary committee:“This is not just about Bitcoin and I also look forward to seeing Blockchain technology implemented in the Lands Registry and the national health registries. Malta can be a global trail-blazer in this regard. I understand that regulators are wary of this technology but the fact is that it’s coming. We must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them. We must be the ones that others copy.”Although Muscat raised several positive use cases of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, Muscat specifically addressed the Bitcoin Blockchain’s ability to handle, store and process sensitive data such as lands registry in a secure, immutable and decentralized ecosystem.Most recently, Ubitquity, a US-based Blockchain startup, partnered with one of the land records bureaus of Brazil to utilize the Bitcoin Blockchain technology to integrate land records to the public Blockchain of Bitcoin. Such method enables land bureaus and other government organizations to store data within an unalterable ledger.“We are incredibly excited to announce our partnership with the land records bureau, a Cartório de Registro de Imóveis [Real Estate Registry Office] in Brazil. This partnership will help to demonstrate to government municipalities the power and benefits of using Blockchain-powered recordkeeping,” said Ubitquity founder and president Nathan Wosnack.The rest of the government, including Labor Minister of Parliament Silvio Schembri, revealed the government’s vision to transform Malta into the Silicon Valley of Europe. The country will focus on the development of innovative technologies such as Bitcoin and Blockchain technology to stay at the forefront of European technological innovation.Schembri stated:“We should aim to have the world’s best environment for the development and commercialization of fintech models and disruptive innovation. The government should ensure that Malta has the appropriate regulatory framework, the right tax system and the best infrastructure to support this ambition. With our geographical position and weather conditions, strong financial system, skills base, entrepreneurial spirit and can-do approach, Malta can truly serve as a test-bed for new sectors and foreign firms to test their new technology and products locally.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Europe    #Malta    #Silicon Valley  
"Thai Crypto Exchange Pauses ICO Registrations, Awaits Release Of Regulatory Framework",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/26/2018 12:10,14711,270,"The privately owned Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX) is deferring the trading and registration of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for two weeks while awaiting a soon-to-be revealed regulatory framework from Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commision (Thai SEC), the Bangkok Post reported Monday, Feb. 26.The decision to postpone the ICO trading, even though there are reportedly five or six ICOs already in development, comes after Bangkok Bank terminated TDAX’s account in order to stop crypto transactions over the weekend, citing the lack of an operating license.TDAX was registered as a digital currency business with the Commerce Ministry’s Business Development department, according to Poramin Insom, TDAX founder and chief executive. However, Insom told the Bangkok Post:""The bank called and asked whether there was an operating licence for proof, but I answered that this business was not under legal jurisdiction [hence the absence of an operating licence], so the bank said it would terminate the company's bank account [with Bangkok Bank], as this business had no licence.""Bangkok Bank is reportedly the first domestic financial institution in Thailand to stop transactions involving cryptocurrencies, according to the Bangkok Post.Insom added that the closure of TDAX’s account at Bangkok Bank has not affected the exchange’s crypto trading, because the exchange still has accounts at Kasikornbank (KBank), Siam Commercial Bank and Krungthai Bank.Insom had said over the weekend that TDAX, which has about $175,725 in registered capital itself, was soon planning to apply for an ICO license with the Thai SEC, pending its regulatory framework.A source told the Bangkok Post that the Thai SEC will most likely release their regulatory framework on March 8, and it will require online exchanges to register with the SEC in order to regulate all ICOs.The framework will reportedly require ICOs to be registered on an Thailand-based ICO portal, with the minimum registered capital marked at 5 mln baht, or about $160,000.A different source told the Bangkok Post that individual investments will be capped at 300,000 baht, or around $9,500, but since this amount ""for individual investors is very tiny. Hence, you will see many Thai startups registered in foreign countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore to raise funds outside of Thailand's legal jurisdiction.""The Central Bank of Thailand sent out a circular last week warning all banks that they can neither invest and trade in cryptocurrencies, nor participate in or create exchanges for crypto trading.

It will give the CFDC a window and some information to make sure there’s no manipulation going on.”Bair’s current main concern with Bitcoin is that the public may be attracted by the promise of high returns and begin investing in Bitcoin and other digital currencies without a clear understanding of what these products are.In regards to the public’s overall understanding of cryptocurrencies, Bair says:“I think there’s a lot of confusion between Bitcoin and blockchain technology.”Bair currently serves on the board of Paxos, a fintech company working with Blockchain technology.

Bank Of America: Our ‘Inability To Adapt’ Could See A Failure To Compete With Crypto,William Suberg,2/23/2018 18:23,67113,923,"Bank of America (BoA) has admitted to US regulators it may be “unable” to compete with the growing use of cryptocurrency.In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week, filed Feb. 22, the major US bank for the first time highlights cryptocurrency as an area that may cause it “substantial expenditure” as it tries to remain competitive.“Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our business,” BoA states in the filing.As banks worldwide eye the cryptocurrency phenomenon, direct interaction remains low. The lack of uptake formed a central reason why the European Central Bank confirmed it had opted for a hands-off approach to legislating the area earlier this month.While BoA has sought to innovate in the sphere, receiving a patent for its proposed cryptocurrency exchange system in December 2017, it has come in for criticism more recently after blocking its clients from credit card purchases of cryptocurrency.As the report to the SEC continues, the institution’s keen awareness of the threat posed to its core business offering by competitors becomes clear.“...The competitive landscape may be impacted by the growth of non-depository institutions that offer products that were traditionally banking products as well as new innovative products,” BoA forecasts. The report continues:“This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services[.]”The bank also pointed to staff retention failures and “increasing competition” in the financial services industry as being detrimental to its prospects.",18,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bank Of America    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #SEC

Mainstream media then published misleading reports that the ban was certain, which helped push a cryptocurrency sell-off.A public petition that called to have both ministers removed from their jobs and to lessen regulation subsequently gathered over 200,000 signatures, which means the government must formally respond to it.Regulatory steps are now a priority for lawmakers, Kim continued, as reports emerge about a customs crackdown on alleged “illegal” trading involving cryptocurrencies.Having identified a trade worth almost $600mln, enforcement is now investigating transactions that openly flout fresh anti-anonymous trading laws, which went into effect Tuesday, Jan. 30.“[The] Customs service has been closely looking at illegal foreign exchange trading using cryptocurrency as part of the government’s task force,” a statement announced.The anonymous bank accounts ban is already facing its share of problems, as it emerged that the increased workload for banks that the new system demands could make smaller exchanges face anything from existing in a regulatory “blind spot” to being forced to cease trading.",20,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrencies  
South Korea: Gov’t Officials Accused of Crypto Insider Trading,William Suberg,1/18/2018 12:30,65830,898,"The past week of confusion and friction over cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea continues to unfold as accusations surface of government officials practicing insider trading, local news source Chosun reports.According to the local reports on Thursday, Jan. 18, some government officials from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), who were aware of forthcoming announcements about either a full ban or significant restrictions on trading, bought and sold cryptocurrency just before that information went public.FSS chief Choi Hyung-sik confirmed the suspicions in a meeting Thursday, admitting:“We have confirmed the intelligence. We have confirmed that some public officials have done such an act”The allegations of activity tantamount to corruption further weakens Seoul's position after its highly-unpopular and contradictory announcements on cryptocurrency regulation caused mass public outcry.A public petition calling for a reversal of the restrictions as well as the firing of some high-profile ministers has now attracted more than 200,000 signatures, meaning it requires a government response within 30 days.Meanwhile, the legality of any insider crypto trading based on classified knowledge is not clear at the moment. Ironically, cryptocurrency’s undefined legal status means the practice cannot be treated as trading involving fully-regulated instruments.A FSS official stated:“There is no code of ethics and no code of conduct for virtual currency investment in FSS regulations, so it’s difficult to say about punishment at this stage.”Chosun also points out that the officials could be accused not of insider trading, but more generally of “the misuse of internal information.”",22,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Tradings    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government  
Russian Ministry of Labor: Gov’t Workers Exempt From Declaring Cryptocurrency Gains,Jon Buck,1/11/2018 3:40,65488,506,"The Russian Ministry of Labor’s updated income, expenses and property declaration guidelines for government employees for reporting on 2017 includes a point about cryptocurrency, local media outlet Izvestia reports. The updated regulations state that government employees do not have to declare “virtual currencies” they obtained.The note about cryptocurrency was added to an already existing point that stated government employees were not required to declare “goods and services in their natural forms,” adding laconically “as well as virtual currencies.”Representatives from the Ministry of Labor told local news outlet RBC that they do not currently require cryptocurrency to be declared because of Russia’s general lack of legislation in the space, stating:""At present, approaches to the definition and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation at the legislative level are not defined.”Russian officials have been required to make public declarations about their income since 2009. ‘Experts’ pointed out to Izvestia that the ruling increased the risk of receiving bribes in cryptocurrency that would go undisclosed, according to the guidelines.However, Vladislav Tsepkov of the “Business Against Corruption” Center, an organization created by the Russian government in 2011 to protect entrepreneurs’ rights, told Izvestia that they saw the risk of government workers taking bribes in crypto as “minimal,” noting:“But cryptocurrency is not a means of payment, it cannot be spent. If they [government workers] sell it and get real income, then it will need to be declared, so the risks are minimal.”Izvestia noted that according to the same regulations, it is required that government workers declare gifts of “real,” or fiat, money from friends or family.These changes come at a time when Russian corruption is at an all time high. According to the statistics on the matter, corruption has increased more than thirty percent in Russia since 2008.The Russian government has yet to create legislation that explicitly covers digital currencies. The country’s government and central bank generally have a negative stance on the subject, calling cryptocurrencies “high risk,” especially for mainstream investors.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Government    #Payments  
Germany Won’t Tax Cryptocurrencies Used To Make Purchases,Veronika Rinecker,3/1/2018 23:51,64686,1895,"The German Federal Ministry of Finances considers Bitcoin as tax-exempt so long as it is used as a means of payment, Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reported Thursday, March 1.The German federal authority published its decision to not subject purchases with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency to taxes on Feb. 27, citing the European Court’s 2015 decision, which set a precedent for all members of the European Union.The Court justified its taxing decision by stating that it considers cryptocurrency as a legal means of payment:“So-called virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin) are considered equal to the legal means of payment, as long as these so-called virtual currencies have been accepted as alternative and contractual means of payment by the parties involved in the transaction and have no other purpose than being used as a means of payment.”According to the decision, a conversion from crypto to fiat or vice versa is classified as “other taxable services”. Therefore, a party that is acting as an intermediary for this exchange will not be taxed. Under this provision, operators of crypto exchanges can also get tax exemptions, “if they complete the purchase and sale of Bitcoin as an intermediary on their own behalf.”The court decision also notes that miner fees will not be taxed, since they are paid on a voluntary basis.These guidelines distinguish Germany from the US where The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats Bitcoin like property, meaning that each purchase using Bitcoin is technically considered to be a sale of property and is, therefore, subject to capital gains tax.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Taxes    #Germany    #Payment  
‘Nothing Finalized’: South Korea Gov’t Ministries Diverge Over Crypto Ban Proposal,Gareth Jenkinson,1/11/2018 13:05,63173,554,"Conflicting reports today, Jan. 11, have led to confusion after a South Korean minister announced plans of a bill intended to ban cryptocurrency trading in the country.According to Reuters, South Korean officials are working on documentation that will make it illegal to trade virtual currencies on local exchanges.The country’s Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said the decision comes in the wake of discussions and agreements between governmental departments, including its Finance Ministry and financial regulators.Reuters reported that Sang-ki announced the ban in a press conference, stating:“There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges.”However, South Korea-based Cointelegraph contributor Joseph Young reported on his personal Twitter today, citing local sources, that the South Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance does not agree with the proposal from the Ministry of Justice to ban cryptocurrency trade in the country. Young reports that a final decision has yet to be made.South Korea Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MSF)""We do not share the same views as the Ministry of Justice on a potential #cryptocurrency exchange ban.""MSF is upset MoJ released premature statement.Massive confusion.https://t.co/anbsOJz1KXAs reported on Dec. 25, South Korea set up a task force to create legislation for the rapidly growing crypto market in the country. Contrary to an outright ban, the body plans to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges as legitimate financial service providers, and ban foreigners and underaged investors from trading on South Korean exchanges.The popularity of cryptocurrency trading in South Korea has seen the price of virtual currencies trading far higher than exchanges in different countries.Nevertheless, the minister’s remarks led to a sell-off of cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin (BTC) price in South Korea plunged 21 percent down to $17,064. This lower BTC price in South Korea is still far higher than the average Bitcoin price on CoinMarketCap ($13,501 at press time), which excludes South Korean exchanges, due to the divergence in prices of cryptocurrencies in the country.As of late December 2017, South Korea accounts for up to a fifth of global cryptocurrency trade.Reuters also reported Jan. 11 that South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange operators were “raided” by police and tax authorities amid allegations of tax evasion this week.According to Reuters, an official from the popular South Korean exchange Coinone said authorities regarded exchange operators in a negative light:“Local police also have been investigating our company since last year; they think what we do is gambling.”Once again, word from correspondents inside South Korea is that the reports of a “raid” are not accurate, and have been embellished by mainstream media outside the country.Cointelegraph’s South Korea correspondent this time retweeted CNBC’s Cryptotrader host Ran Neuner, confirming that the so-called “raids” on exchanges were actually just routine visits from tax authorities. Young notes that local media are calling the “raid” an “unexpected friendly visit”:Fake News Reuters claiming South Korean #cryptocurrency and #Bitcoin exchanges were raided by police.While local reporters and other media outlets are reporting it was an unexpected friendly visit.Raid means something completely different @Reuters https://t.co/0c9NOApSKYAnother South Korea-based trader noted on Twitter that the situation was a result of confusion both on the part of authorities and the exchanges themselves, who are reportedly willing to comply if given applicable legislation is put into place:“There's a lot of confusion on all sides, gov. and exchanges.”On the fiat side of things, on Jan. 7 local South Korean media reported that the country’s authorities were planning to probe six major banks to look for alleged money laundering linked to cryptocurrency exchanges.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Cryptocurrencies    #Bitcoin Price  
IRS Forms New Team To Track Down Crypto Tax Evaders,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/9/2018 18:35,59122,642,"The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has assembled a team of 10 investigators for international crime investigations as well as for finding tax evaders who use cryptocurrency, Bloomberg reports Thursday, Feb. 8.Chief of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division Don Fort said that the team will work with international criminal agencies to investigate unlicensed exchanges as well:“It’s possible to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the same fashion as foreign bank accounts to facilitate tax evasion.”According to Fort, the group’s focus for now is on how crypto users change their fiat currency into crypto.“We know that you want to get your money out at some point.”In March 2014, the IRS began issuing guidance for the taxation of cryptocurrency, which they treated as a property that had capital gains or capital losses for tax purposes. However, only 802 people complied in filing their own cryptocurrency gains or losses for their taxes in 2015.The IRS has faced hurdles this year trying to get access through a court order to user information on the crypto exchange Coinbase. Their original request for records of over 500,000 users was denied by courts and reduced to just 14,000 users that reportedly had high trading activity over $20,000.Coinbase saw their partial victory as setting a precedent for the dealings between tax-enforcing government bodies and crypto exchanges that have a commitment to protecting user privacy.A Cointelegraph expert blog published in Dec. 2017 brought up the possibility of a tax amnesty for those who failed to report gains from digital currency earning, similar to a IRS program for filing income from undisclosed offshore accounts.",19,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #IRS    #Taxes    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Coinbase    #Transactions  
Cryptocurrencies Occupying Minds of Banks and Regulators,Darryn Pollock,1/15/2018 15:55,38360,444,"With the rise of interest that hit its peak in late 2017 surrounding cryptocurrencies, it was only a matter of time before the regulators and their kin got stuck into the cryptocurrency world. Banks, central banks, regulators and other financial institutes are racking their brains about this phenomenon, and how to approach it.Regulators, and by association, those in the financial sector, were caught very unaware by the crypto boom in 2017. However, with its adoption and interest at this all-time high, those behind the eight ball have had a chance to catch up.Bitcoin, despite being over nine years old, can now really count itself out of its nascent stage. It has breached the mainstream barrier for investors - from Wall Street to the everyday man on the street.Farzam Ehsani, Blockchain lead at Rand Merchant Bank in South Africa, demonstrates this simple by his title within a major bank in the country. He adds that cryptocurrencies will truly “emerge from the nascent stage of being at the fringe.""""There isn’t any central bank or financial institution that isn’t thinking about this and what it means for the economy,"" Ehsani said.Because regulators are now taking Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seriously - as a threat or otherwise - as well as looking into Blockchain technology, they will start to flex their muscle.It has been seen already with a threat coming out of Korea on a crypto ban, which proved to be false, still affecting the market.Bitcoin is often in the limelight as the most well known and popular cryptocurrency, and thus the one that many regulators set their sights on, but there are over 1,000 others to deal with.Regulators may be mulling over what to do about cryptocurrencies and how to whip them into a shape that suits the traditional financial institutions, but it will be a tough task.Ehsani expected greater regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges, where buying and selling took place, as well as of the interface between cryptocurrencies and regular fiat currencies. However, it has been more of a case-by-case situation.The fact that dinosaur-type institutions have been forced to take cryptocurrencies seriously, even if a little late, is probably a positive in the long run.It hands legitimacy to the cryptomarket, and despite even the best efforts of regulators, it would seem they cannot kill the entire thing. Regulation has always had a positive side to it and if that is reached the market may stabilize and be less volatile.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Bitcoin Adoption    #Wall Street    #South Africa    #Banned Bitcoin

Advocate Files for Immediate Regulation of Bitcoin in India,Jon Buck,1/9/2018 3:33,37823,324,"Advocate Bivas Chatterjee filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on Friday in the Calcutta court to immediately regulate the flow of Bitcoin in and out of India, according to local news sources.In his petition, Chatterjee suggested that cryptocurrencies are predominantly used for nefarious purposes and should be regulated or banned, as in China, as quickly as possible. He said:“Use of Bitcoin was maximised post demonetisation, when cashless economy was being promoted. In India, law enforcement agencies are confused… Either the government should ban Bitcoin by declaring it illegal like China or there must be a regulatory body to control its flow.”According to the advocate, Bitcoin is particularly difficult to track, making it the vehicle of choice for illegal financial transactions. He said:“Crypto currencies promise fast and anonymous fund transfers at a low cost. Such transactions are really difficult to track… crypto currencies are perfect facilitators for crime. Investigating authorities are facing hurdles while probing crimes involving crypto currencies or Bitcoins because of its anonymity.”The statements from Chatterjee reflect a growing belief that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are too volatile and anonymous for governments to keep from regulating them, with some even calling them Ponzi schemes.However, other economies like Japan have embraced Bitcoin as the payment method of the future.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India

"Putin Condemns Bitcoin, Calls for Russian Ban of Digital Currencies",David Dinkins,10/10/2017 21:10,37218,1203,"Russian government-owned RT and Reuters both report that Vladimir Putin has decided to take a stand against cryptocurrencies in general, and Bitcoin in particular. RT reports that Putin believes digital currencies could be used to finance terrorism, evade taxes and launder money, and that Bitcoin itself is a pyramid scheme.RT quotes Putin as saying that Bitcoin creates:“Opportunities to launder funds acquired through criminal activites, tax evasion, even terrorism financing, as well as the spread of fraud schemes.”After Putin blamed a host of Russia’s criminal problems on Bitcoin, the central bank echoed his remarks, calling digital currency a pyramid scheme:“We have seen how Bitcoin has transformed a payment unit into an asset, which is bought in order to obtain a high yield in a short period of time. This is the definition of a pyramid.”Of course, just a year or two ago, pundits were saying Bitcoin needed to be regulated because the falling price was causing investors to lose money. Now it’s the rising price that’s a problem, apparently.Ironically, just last month Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said:“There is no sense banning [digital currencies], there is a need to regulate them.”Less than a week ago, Siluanov was planning on including the topic of digital currency in the country’s financial literacy strategy.Likewise, at the end of August, Cointelegraph reported that the Moscow Exchange was considering including Bitcoin-based derivatives and exchange traded funds (ETFs) among its many offerings.Even though today is the first time Putin took a direct stand against Bitcoin, clouds have been gathering on the horizon for some time. Russia’s deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev recently called Bitcoin a pyramid scheme and announced his intention only to allow “qualified investors” rather than “ordinary people” to buy Bitcoin.Cointelegraph reported earlier today that the Bank of Russia is attempting to block all Bitcoin exchanges in the country. Despite the sharply negative news out of Russia today, Bitcoin continues its surge toward $5,000. This comes following a sharp drop from $5,000 to $3,000 last month, and a rapid rebound that has brought the digital currency almost back to it’s all time high.In the last month, the market first reacted to, then shrugged off, China’s ICO ban, China’s exchange ban, South Korea’s ICO ban, and now Russia’s attempt at banning Bitcoin.

In December 2017, crypto markets reacted to confusion regarding a rumored full ban on cryptocurrencies in the country.

That is why we need an even-handed regulatory agenda, one that protects against risks without discouraging innovation.”She continued, “A clear-eyed approach can help us harness the gains and avoid the pitfalls of the new crypto-assets landscape.”Lagarde’s call for a balanced outlook on cryptocurrency comes at a time of increasing regulatory involvement in the industry, while traditional financiers continue to call Bitcoin a ‘bubble’ and pundits spy the start of a market surge.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Christine Lagarde    #IMF    #Government  
"With ICO Coming Under Attack, Market Participants Still Wary of Govt Regulation",Frisco d'Anconia,7/9/2017 15:35,15570,351," Current ICO craze is out of control because people never learned their lesson with TheDAO after everyone got bailed out. Disaster incoming.?Quite recently, Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin stated that the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) craze is out of control because people never learned their lesson with the DAO after everyone got bailed out. In a post on Twitter, the man who just resigned from Coinbase to concentrate on Litecoin declared ICOs are a disaster that is waiting to explode soon.ICOs have come under serious attack recently especially with accusations of scams. However, it remains one of the numerous clever innovations in the crypto space signifying how funds can be raised in a free market without the involvement of the state or banks. Besides, it eliminates the cost and burdensome barriers involved in traditional IPOs.But maybe, after all, the ICO market just needs the government involvement?David Mondrus, founder of Trive, an entity using the Blockchain to kill fake news with crowdsourcing and crypto, believes it is the end of the monopoly that is Wall Street. He thinks Charlie Lee's fears are unfounded:""A lot of people believe there is an impending disaster. I don't know Charlie's reasons specifically but I lived through the Dot-com crash. We survived that and we'll survive whatever this brings. But post Dot-com crash we got Google and Facebook.""From David's perspective, access to capital is the number one predictor of success in any marketplace and not the quality of skills, execution or ideas. ""Because Amazon raised a shit load during their IPO and follow-on offerings they are able to construct a series of warehouses in the US from which to serve their customers. Something their competitors were not able to do.""                        For Marc Kenigsberg of Bitcoinchaser, the large hand of govt corps and their associates want us to fail as a community, but we should not give them any ammunition. ""The sad thing is that ICOs as a vehicle is incredible. A great manifestation of the possibilities of a newer more distributed economy,"" Marc hinted.Murray Barnetson of Bitcoin Powpow has a similar belief, which is ICO's are the second best thing that has ever happened to business (after cryptos). ""It gives anybody with an idea and a smartphone an opportunity to create a business that has direct access to billions of people to raise funding,"" he contributed.There is no doubt ICOs are getting rid of the bureaucratic tendencies and the burdensome process of raising funds for production. It has provided an impetus where people with ideas do not need permission from anyone to access capital for implementation.""The old way (IPO) eliminates all but the bravest and richest because it costs a fortune to list, a fortune to stay listed, red tape, Sarbanes-Oxley, blah blah blah,"" Murray explains to Cointelegraph.Yet he also agrees ICOs are a disaster waiting to happen and it will cause a major crypto crash one day.Murray says:“Too many ICO's have almost no substance to them. Although whitepapers are commonplace, I have yet to see something like a business plan, forecasts, marketing plans etc. The amount of real junk already out there is mind blowing and the number of ICO's will probably increase exponentially. At some stage, people will work out they have been scammed, or they have invested in a 16-year-old kid who has absolutely no idea what he is doing. Some ICO's will become the next Amazon or Google or Apple but most will fail dismally.”According to David Mondrus, the cost to IPO a company is north of $2 mln which requires a minimum of $100 mln in sales as well. This he is convinced, is not exactly small business friendly. While credit used to be available for small businesses at high rates in the past, recently that has dried up for all but the most creditworthy companies.""Crowdfunding and Seed/Angel rounds are available but if my cost to ICO is some code and a website, all of the alternatives are more expensive, take longer and raise less,"" he explained further.The call for the state to get involved and regulate the scene to 'protect' the public was opposed by all the community members who spoke to Cointelegraph. In their view that will defeat the purpose of the whole ICO idea.David Mondrus reasons that if the regulators had done their job the last 30 years, none of this would be necessary, and asking for regulations in this space is oxymoronic:""ICOs are impossible to regulate (like BTC) and trying to do so is stupid. It is a way to bypass the wall street monopoly but as a byproduct of no regulations, there's little quality assurance.""On the part of Marc, calling for regulations is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. In his estimation people on the outside don't understand there will be no distinction made between the good and the bad. However, his idea is that there should be responsibility from both sides of the coin.Murray recommended that if you are getting into ICO's, do it for the quick hit and get out or look for the proper ideas with proven board members, forecasts etc. More so, think about their idea as to whether it really is going to solve a problem or create something new that we need. He concludes:""Take a deep breath, apply some of that very rare ‘common’ sense, and if you still think it ticks the boxes, go for it.""",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Markets    #Charlie Lee    #Government    #David Mondrus    #Amazon    #Litecoin  
ICO Ban in Japan - a ‘Definite Possibility’,Darryn Pollock,10/16/2017 19:35,15371,352,"It seems as if the world of cryptocurrency has essentially moved on without China, after they decided to excuse themselves from the race with a ban on ICOs and exchanges. This has led to other countries in Asia taking up the mantle, such as Korea and Japan.Japan has long been one of the champion states of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, labeling the biggest one, Bitcoin, legal tender earlier in the year. However, despite this friendly approach, those within Japan say an ICO ban could still be coming.The Asian cryptomarket has long been the dominate one, from mining to trade volume, but since China decided to set a hardline precedent, interest in the county has died down.However, the interest in cryptocurrency itself has not died, in fact, it reached new highs last week. In the Asian market, there has been an appreciation of interest as other countries near to China have picked up the additional flow of cryptocurrency.South Korea swiftly followed China’s lead in planning to ban initial coin offerings - to the heavy opposition of local entrepreneurs - while Taiwan has warmed up to them instead.Japan, as one of the early investors with its recognition of Bitcoin, has picked up a huge stake in the market, now trading about 63 percent of the world’s Bitcoin.Many in Asia see Japan as the liberal safe haven for cryptocurrency, but Koji Higashi, cofounder of digital token wallet IndieSquare and an outspoken figure in Japan’s cryptocurrency scene, would not be so daring.Japan is still a risk-averse country, and one that is also strongly conservative in nature. Higashi says he still sees an ICO crackdown as a “definite possibility”. He said:“Japan’s not really ICO-friendly. Regulators are just more tentative. They’re just trying to figure out if it’s going to be good or bad. It doesn’t mean they won’t start regulating more heavily in the future when problems start emerging.”However, Higashi is also not dooming ICOs in Japan before they have stood a fair trial. He is optimistic that if ICOs come out looking good through the trials they face, then Japan will be leading the way.“If ICOs turn out to be a really revolutionary concept … then Japan will have a head start and attract a lot of ICO projects.”That’s already beginning to happen as companies worldwide are moving their projects to Switzerland and Japan, which would help those countries earn tax revenue.",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #ICO    #China    #Switzerland    #South Korea    #North Korea  
"According to Key European Regulator, ICOs Could be Derivative Activities",Nick Ayton,11/16/2017 1:05,15195,441,"Our London Correspondent Nick Ayton looks at the recent announcements coming out of The European Securities & Markets Authority (ESMA) and considers the immediate impact on the ICO community…On the back of a series of statements, ESMA today issued one about ICOs, highlighting their concerns for investors that ICOs can cover fraudulent and illegal activities. ESMA further warned investors they can lose their money, and there are now big impacts for ICO platform providers. Also impacted are those agencies, partners and service providers that are involved in promoting, talking about and handling any ICOs activities.The biggest impact will be for firms (ICO platform providers) that are central to issuing a token as part of the ICO process. It is a stark reminder of their inherent obligations to do things properly and follow the rules that are already in place.“ESMA is concerned that firms involved in ICOs may conduct their activities without complying with relevant applicable EU legislation.”It very much looks like ESMA is getting to grips with the direction of travel and how they intend to legislate Initial Coin Offerings now and in the future. The main concern of ESMA is protecting investors, which is a bit crass given the lack of investor protection leading up to and after 2008.However like most regulation, most of it is bad and protects the few. Now you may be thinking this announcement will only apply to the EU member states. Yes, this is true, but it also brings most ICO activities into the regulatory tent - from a corporate, legal, investor or ICO provider perspective where one or more participants is a European or based here.Given 99% of ‘tokens’ issued to date, regardless of the white papers’ disclaimers that deny all knowledge and claim their token isn’t a security, it is! Now this presents a big challenge to the ICO market as regulators look to tidy things up and bring a stop to the wild west behaviours seen in the early part of 2017.If you have issued a token that is a security, the project, the ICO platform providers, the PR and marketing firms fall within and are expected to follow these guidelines.For ICO platform providers the implications are significant and the costs of being able to support current legislation will rise, exposing the directors and owners of these businesses to compliance requirements. There are many ICO platforms pumping the madness, and they take on any project regardless and have no consideration of the token being a security or whether the project makes sense, whether the founders are credible and there is some form of governance. The bottom line is we are better off without these platforms as they place naïve founders in the firing line.Is this announcement part of the streamlining if the ICO market that will push out bad actors? If so, it has to a good thing right…?Will we see ICO platform providers having to be regulated themselves? Inevitable or likely…The key part of ESMA’s statement was:“ESMA stresses that firms involved in ICOs should give careful consideration as to whether their activities constitute regulated activities. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules will constitute a breach.”The key wording here is firms, as in:ICO platform providers that issue tokens, take in deposits of crypto and hold it (have custody);PR and marketing firms that pump and advertise tokens that are financial instruments (without licensing and the right declaration);Board Advisors that evangelise about the project, pumping a security;Community Managers that offer incentives to buyers of tokens that are securities.Then we have the whole pre sale process that offers deep discounts to inside investors at the expense of the public…The knock on effects will be far reaching…ESMA clearly states…“Where ICOs qualify as financial instruments, it is likely that firms involved in ICOs conduct regulated investment activities, in which case they (ICO platform providers)  need to comply with the relevant legislation, including for example: the Prospectus Directive, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD); and the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.”Most notably, ICO activities can also be linked to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, because the token is seen as a financial product and covered by MiFID that controls the advertising (pumping) and distribution of financial products. Therefore any ICO service provider that touches the ‘token,’ which is the financial instrument, has to fall in line.Then there is the Prospectus Directive relating to proper projects’ correct disclosure and information for the investor to make an informed decision. Adequate information in the white paper with the likely additions of detailed ROI (returns) and revenue projects, governance around use of funds and the commitment for the founders to deliver on their promises and obligations will likely be required. When the white paper looks more like a prospectus, that it is when you have a token that is a security.When is a token not a security…?It’s not a security when it is a currency, a reward for doing something on the platform, access to an ecosystem where tokens are earned like air miles. And that is about it.Some tokens under eMoney rules allow more flexibility to be linked to a product or service and offer rewards for participation, such as a coupon or voucher that holds monetary value…If the purpose of your token is to bring capital into your business, be under no illusions. In the US, UK and EU and in many other jurisdictions it will be considered a ‘polling instrument’ (comes under Collective Investment Scheme Rules) and therefore a ‘security’ because the capital will be used by the founders to build something…Be safe…work with only the ICO providers that take things seriously, do the right things and have everything in place required to issue and promote a token that is a security.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ESMA    #ICO    #Security    #Markets    #USA    #United Kingdom    #EU  
Major Crypto Investors Request Token Oversight Exemption In Meeting With SEC,Helen Partz,4/20/2018 1:04,23063,78,"Top cryptocurrency investors Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to consider a cryptocurrency exemption at a private meeting, the Wall Street Journal reports April 19.The Silicon Valley-based venture capital firms met with top officials of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, which regulates Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), to argue against stringent cryptocurrency regulations that they claim would impair the development of the young growing industry.According to WSJ, the group of crypto investors argued that ICO tokens should not be considered as investments, but as products that can be used to access services of startup companies, which would allow startups to carry out token sales without observing formalities  such as business reviews and financial reports. The group assured the SEC that ICO issuers would be held accountable in cases of fraud.The SEC has privately expressed skepticism to such a broad exemption, and is more likely to opt for a “limited exemption” from oversight, wherein each investor would acquire investments limits, and the purchased tokens would not be resold to third parties for profit.Since the SEC introduced its cryptocurrency probe in February, which followed previous suggestions that ICOs may be violating securities laws, the regulatory body has increased pressure on ICO projects. The SEC even shut down stock trading of three companies due to “questions regarding the nature of the companies’ business operations” vis-a-vis ICOs.The question of cryptocurrency and ICO regulations is a crucial issue, with many crypto believers expressing their concerns over excessive regulatory scrutiny towards the industry. Others, like head of regulatory relations at Ripple Ryan Zagone, encourages regulatory measures. Recently, Zagone compared the existing crypto regulatory framework to the early days of the Internet.“We’re at that time now where we need more clarity and rules and we need more certainty. It’s a good time to start revisiting that ‘wait and see’ ­approach taken by regulators.”According to Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, developing sensible regulation will take time, “You can’t start writing laws and regulations today and expect to get it right, it’s building on wet cement.”In March, Chief Legal and Risk Officer at Coinbase Mike Lempres claimed that at its current stage, the US regulatory system “is harming healthy innovation” due to a lack of understanding of what should be allowed and what should be not, and how digital assets should be considered; either as securities, commodities, property, or currency.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #USA    #Andreessen Horowitz    #Investments    #ICO    #Tokens    #Fraud    #Cryptocurrencies  
Malaysian Central Bank: ID Now Needed For Any Crypto Exchange Transaction,William Suberg,2/28/2018 15:15,23033,293,"Cryptocurrency exchanges in Malaysia must now fully identify traders after new central bank anti-money laundering legislation came into effect Tuesday, Feb. 27.A copy of the legislation and official press release from the Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) states that any exchanges offering crypto-to-fiat, fiat-to-crypto and even crypto-to-crypto trading must “identify the customer and verify that customer’s identity.”As Cointelegraph reported in November 2017, forecasting the regulations, BNM Governor Tan Sri Muhammad bin Ibrahim placed emphasis on the need to control potential criminal usage of digital currencies.“The advent of digital currencies as some have forecast will mark the beginning of a new era in the financial sector. As authorities, we cannot be oblivious to these developments,” the BNM Governor said.Now, exchange operators must comply with various statutes relating to “customer due diligence” (CDD) before allowing new and existing accounts to legally continue activity.According to the legislation, “reliable, independent source documents, data or information” is required, and specifically a government-issued ID:“In conducting CDD on an individual customer and beneficial owner, the reporting institution is required to obtain at least the following information:(a) full name;(b) National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) number or passport number or reference number of any other official documents bearing the photograph of the customer or beneficial owner;(c) residential or mailing address; (d) date of birth; (e) nationality; and (f) purpose of transaction”Formal steps to add transparency to cryptocurrency trading markets are traditionally viewed with optimism by proponents.In Asia, Japan’s exchange licensing program, preparations for which began in April last year, has served to add weight to the argument that such measures are necessary in order to allow cryptocurrency to debut to a much wider mainstream audience.Neighboring South Korea is also considering an exchange licensing scheme for after elections in June this year, having previously stipulated all exchange users must tie their account identity to their bank account.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Transactions    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Malaysia    #Central Bank    #South Korea    #Asia    #Japan  
"India Central Bank ‘In Process’ of Making Bitcoin Regulation, Withholds Details",William Suberg,10/13/2017 14:16,22925,330,"India has refused to comment on its progress with cryptocurrency regulation, only appearing to confirm that official plans were “in progress.”Reports by local news outlet Economic Times quote Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor NS Vishwanathan as making comments to the press at an event in Calcutta today.“I can’t comment on a policy that is still in the making,” he said.Draft proposals of a recommendations on how to regulate cryptocurrency in India surfaced in August. These were the result of a government panel specifically tasked with researching the issue in April.Cryptocurrency investment and trading have ballooned in the country ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s highly contentious cash reforms began in November 2016.Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor said earlier this week:“Measures of economic freedom are strongly correlated with economic success throughout the world. In India, a great deal of friction was introduced with the immediate banning of the vast majority of the country’s circulating currency. In contrast, digital currencies are freely transferred person-to-person anywhere in the world instantly. This can have a dramatic positive impact on an economy suffering from onerous financial restrictions like India.”Indians have overwhelmingly used cash as the basic means of exchange, and aggressive government plans to make payments digital and link transactions to participants biometrically have received considerable criticism.Taylor added:“I doubt digital currency will overtake the rupee anytime soon, but dysfunction certainly creates the right environment to motivate consumers and businesses to seek an alternative like digital currency to address their needs.”",6,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Central Bank    #Ryan Taylor  
"Why We Shouldn’t Pay Much Attention To Regulation In China, At Least For Now",Darryn Pollock,2/26/2018 12:45,22885,249,"The rapid expansion in Bitcoin price and mainstream adoption through the latter part of last year was seemingly matched by an increase in scrutiny and reflection by government regulators in early 2018.It has turned into a battle for some, a lesson in learning for others, and a chance to embrace for the remainder as different nations approach cryptocurrencies, and their associated facets such as ICOs and Blockchain technology, differently.Many countries are still sitting on the fence, waiting to see how cryptocurrencies, and particularly Blockchain, can be utilized and implemented within their laws and regulations, while some, most notably China, have forged ahead with a harsh and hard-line approach. China has moved towards quashing cryptocurrency in three stages, first banning ICOs, then exchanges, and finally blocking foreign cryptocurrency sites from its citizens with a massive firewall to try and nail the coffin shut.However, the successes of outright bans and hard-line regulation should really be questioned as Ronnie Moas, famed stock picker who has become somewhat of a champion for cryptocurrencies says that the fear and damage regulation does to the strength and price of Bitcoin is “only noise.”Moas, sporting an eye-patch due to a diagnosis of Bell's Palsy, a treatable a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles in the face, spoke to Cointelegraph about the effect hardline regulation will have on cryptocurrency.“I don’t pay too much attention to these [regulations]. It is only noise as far as I am concerned unless China, Russia, the US and South Korea come out with some explosive joint statement on the same day, I wouldn’t pay too much attention to this. Bitcoin is not going anywhere,” Moas said definitely: “There is a mind-boggling demand and supply imbalance and I expect it will drive the  price to $50,000 or $100,000 over the next few years, regulation or no regulation.” He recommends not to overprice the value of China market:“If China bans Bitcoin, 190 countries around the world are more than happy to buy whatever they are selling. If China dumps Bitcoin on the market, it goes on sale, and people will scoop it up in a fire sale, I am not worried about that. Look at what happened two weeks ago; something caused Bitcoin to drop to $6,000 and look where it is now, over $11,000; 80 percent in two weeks. You have to just disregard all the noise.”Indeed, Bitcoin has shown on a number of occasions it can bounce back from damaging news, including fake news and FUD. In February, there was confusion surrounding a potential trading ban in South Korea, which saw Bitcoin's price slump, but it has since gotten over that hurdle. Furthermore, there was even a misinterpretation of an Indian budget speech about a Bitcoin ban in that country which affected the price, and again, Bitcoin showed enough resiliance to bounce back.However, in China, there has been hard news emanating from as high up as the Communist Party Congress that Bitcoin will not be tolerated in the People’s Republic. However, how effective, on ground level, has their bans and regulations been? The most recent move to ban access to foreign Bitcoin sites and exchanges showed a glimpse behind the iron curtain on the war that was being waged. China was already struggling to lay a killing blow by clamping down on Chinese exchanges, but it was revealed it was totally losing the war. In Moas opinion, it will be the calmer heads that prevail:“There will be regulation, but it will be for the fringe elements in the arena. I don't think this will impact the major exchanges. I don’t think it will impact Bitcoin or Ripple, or Cardano. I think people are making too much out of this. I don’t care if 90 percent of the names here are scams, low quality, high risk, pump and dump names, because 95 percent of the market cap is concentrated in the top 20, and that is really all anyone sophisticated and mature would be focusing their attention on.”Looking from the outside on a place like China, one does have to question if the government has been successful in eliminating Bitcoin with its hard-line regulations. Bitcoin price is on the rise, the general feeling globally is that the cryptocurrency space is a good one, and the technology continues to flourish. So, what is happening in China, or to be more correct, what are Chinese Bitcoiners and Bitcoin companies doing among the regulations?Huobi, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges that was originally founded in China, is one Bitcoin company that was definitely affected by the regulations in China but is one that is making alternative arrangements. Herbert Sim, part of Huobi’s digital marketing team, spoke to Cointelegraph about how the company has had to deal with the crackdown. “Huobi Global main operations are now currently out of Singapore, with its other office across the global in major cities such as Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, and more recently in San Francisco,” he said, indicating that they can of course no longer directly operate from mainland China:“Cryptocurrency is a completely new industry, one that governments from around the world are experimenting and figuring out how to govern it properly with policies in place. But as they are in the process of this experimentation, it is also up to the cryptocurrency exchanges themselves to first self-regulate.”Essentially, Huobi has been able to roll with the punches in terms of the Chinese government's rules, and instead of fighting to not be controlled, they are looking to impose their own safety checks and regulations to make them more appetizing to hard-lined regulators.” Robin Zhu, Chief Operating officer of Huobi, added:“We have taken the initiative to launch user security and protection Initiatives such as the ’User Protection Fund’ and the ‘Security Reserve’; and a world first autonomous token listing exchange, HADAX; and increasing our Customer Service headcount to more than 250 people, across multiple time zones and multi-language support.”So, it would seem, that in the case of Huobi at least, the China crackdown has not stunted their work, as they have pushed beyond the walls of the People’s Republic, and as Sim adds: “Our client base has still been steadily increasing on an exponential rate. Our China user database is still accessing as per normal as we are an international, global brand.”There is no denying that regulation needs to come to the cryptocurrency space. It has gotten to a point where it is too big to ignore and needs to fit into the global society, and the rules that are already in place as parameters.  Many countries are excited and keen to see what cryptocurrencies can bring, with only a few really trying to stamp it out. But for those who believe they can eradicate it, it would seem that that path is a difficult and foolhardy one. Bitcoin is global enough and demanded enough that people will either make a way to get at it of they are blocked, or those around who aren’t blocked will gleefully take up the slack.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #China    #Huobi  
BoE Governor Mark Carney: Crypto Ecosystem Should Be Held To ‘Same Standards’,Helen Partz,3/2/2018 14:51,22876,432,"Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney called for the authorities to regulate cryptocurrencies rather than “ban them outright” in his speech to the inaugural Scottish Economics Conference in Edinburgh on March 2, as reported by Financial Times.According to Carney, cryptocurrencies do not threaten “financial stability” at the moment, but they could after more consumers get involved. Carney believes that it is time to incorporate the cryptocurrency ecosystem into the rest of the financial system, applying to it the same regulatory approach and the same “rigorous standards”.Carney believes that this would not only minimize money-laundering and consumer risks, but also help adapt the technology for wider public use.Following his recent speech at London’s Regent's University, where Carney argued that Bitcoin has “failed” as a currency, the central bank’s governor again emphasized his opinion that digital currencies like Bitcoin should actually be regarded as assets.Carney pointed out the tremendous volatility of these “assets,” stressing that cryptocurrencies have “exhibited classic hallmarks of bubbles” since their prices are based on “beliefs regarding their future supply and demand”, and do not have “intrinsic value” or external backing.BoE governor expressed his view of the cryptocurrency market as “quite a lottery.”“Consider that if you had taken out a £1,000 student loan in Bitcoin in last December to pay your sterling living costs for next year, you’d be short about £500 right now. If you’d done the same last September, you’d be ahead by £2,000. That’s quite a lottery,” Carney said.Carney’s allegations come after the UK’s Treasury Select Committee announced that it will launch an inquiry into cryptocurrencies and their effects on the UK investors and businesses. The purpose of this inquiry is to explore the risks and benefits of digital currencies and Blockchain technology.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #United Kingdom    #Bank of England    #Cryptocurrencies  
Japanese Financial Regulator Issues ‘Punishment Notices’ For 7 Crypto Exchanges,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/8/2018 11:25,22812,219,"The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has sent “punishment notices” to seven crypto exchanges and temporarily halted the activities of two more after a round of inspections prompted by January’s Coincheck hack, CNBC reports Thursday, March 8.The FSA issued business improvement orders for a lack of “the proper and required internal control systems” to seven exchanges, including Coincheck, which was specifically cited as lacking a system for preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism.Exchanges Bit Station and FSHO are to be closed for one month from today, according to CNBC. The FSA reported that a senior Bit Station official used exchange customers’ Bitcoin (BTC) for personal purposes, and Bit Station has ended its application for registering as an exchange.The hack of more than $500 mln of NEM from the Japanese Coincheck crypto exchange has been attributed to the fact that the coins were stored on a low-security hot wallet. In the aftermath of the hack, the FSA inspected Coincheck and ordered all Japanese crypto exchanges to submit reports on their risk management systems.The FSA also announced in mid-February on-site inspections of 15 Japanese crypto exchanges, those currently awaiting registration, of their computer safety system measures.Coincheck had promised customers to refund all stolen coins, a statement supported by the FSA, who confirmed through CNBC that Coincheck had enough funds to do so and would be releasing a reimbursement plan later today.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Financial Services    #Coincheck    #NEM  
Belgian Tax Authority To Search For Taxpayers Using Foreign Crypto Exchanges,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/4/2018 11:30,22760,387,"The Belgian Special Tax Inspectorate (STI) is looking for Belgian individuals who have invested in cryptocurrencies in foreign exchanges, local news outlet De Standaard reported Friday, March 2.After receiving information from Finnish authorities that several Belgian taxpayers had been trading on Finnish crypto exchanges, the STI started looking into the cases of three Belgians involved, with a fourth file closed as a “non case,” The Brussels Times wrote.According to a rule introduced in Belgium last year, crypto speculators are obliged to pay a 33 percent tax on crypto profits, filed under the “various income” section on the tax form.Due to the anonymous nature of crypto trading platforms, De Standaard writes that the crypto tax rule has been hard to enforce. However, the STI plans to follow the example of the US’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which legally compelled US-based crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase to turn over the data on around 13,000 customers for tax enforcement purposes.Belgian tax authorities will try to use the double taxation treaty between Belgium and the US as a way to get information about possible Belgian Coinbase users, according to De Standaard. The STI also plan to send similar requests for information to crypto exchanges generally to find out whether any Belgian taxpayers are customers.Francis Adyns, a representative from the FPS Finance, a Federal Public Service of Belgium, told De Standaard:“It will be investigated whether a similar question can be asked as that of the IRS [...] There are several other websites that deal in bitcoins and many other crypto coins. Every known website in this domain can count on our explicit attention.”While the IRS had initially asked Coinbase to turn over information on all of its users, a court case brought on by Coinbase decided in Nov. 2017 that only information on “high volume” users needed to be given to the IRS.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Coinbase    #Taxes    #IRS    #Government    #Belgium  
Moscow Court Rules Crypto Assets Cannot Be Seized For Debt Payment,Helen Partz,3/1/2018 21:21,18854,407,"In a hearing on Feb. 26, the Moscow Arbitration Court ruled that cryptocurrency funds of a bankrupt debtor cannot be seized as payment to creditors, local media group RBC reports.The court considered an application filed by finance manager Aleksey Leonov, who requested permission to recover funds from a debtor, Ilya Tsarkov, by seizing Tsarkov’s crypto assets. According to RBC, Leonov requested that the court require Tsarkov to provide the password for his cryptocurrency wallet on the website Blockchain.info.The court reviewed documents that proved Tsarkov was in possession of a crypto wallet with Bitcoins, but refused to grant Leonov’s request to seize Tsarkov’s cryptocurrency in order to repay the debt.According to Nikita Kulikov, executive director of the Moscow law firm HEADS Consulting, the court could not have reached any other ruling, as cryptocurrency legislation is not firmly established in Russia at the moment.“If the court had included cryptocurrency assets in the state of insolvency, that would have meant that Russian law recognized cryptocurrency assets as a type of money, which is contrary to the Central Bank’s stance, or as a property, which is not established by the law,” said Kulikov.Leonov disagreed, stating that despite the murky legal status of cryptocurrencies in Russia, there is no reason for it not to be included in the group of assets which can be seized by a creditor. Leonov added that the precedent set by the court could result in an “outflow of assets” in future debt arbitration cases.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Russian government will finalize regulations for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, and cryptocurrency exchanges by July, 2018.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies    #Court    #Law  
The Birth of an Asset Class: Expert Blog,Ronnie Potel,11/2/2017 18:45,18689,421,"*Expert Blog is Cointelegraph new series of articles by the crypto industry leaders. It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.We have passed a tipping point for the evolution of Blockchain technology as the token universe moves firmly into asset class territory.As a former senior investment banker and having spent almost two decades focused on Asian equity capital markets, I am used to seeing local markets that in the broader global equity market context would seem subscale. Blockchain assets in token form represent over $170 bln in value today. The GEM market in Hong Kong (growth market) is a sub $40 bln market, and several Asian countries do not have equity markets above $170 bln in total market cap. Even more instructive is the daily volume traded at $4 bln+ the volume of activity on many days in Blockchain assets exceeds that of some of the more mature Asian markets such as Taiwan.  The institutional fiat world is taking note, with the headline numbers of the market justifying attention, we have seen the level of inquiry increase from blue-chip financial institutions as they begin to get up the learning curve. The wall of capital that will flow from this is still being educated, but the discussions are taking a more committed tone.We are still in the very early days of this technology and it is by no means settled on what the core lower level protocols will look like, but with the promise of interoperability we should end up with a multi-winner landscape subject to specific use cases.The ICO market has rightly begun to struggle. The early days have been characterized by generally weak governance standards and poorly conceived offering structures. There are notable exceptions but even the quality issuers have been taking advantage of the market momentum to stretch rights, obligations and terms. A cleaning up and raising of standards is inevitable as the market moves to a more discerning view of what has value. Regulation has a part to play here.Sensible regulation is essential to the asset class and frameworks applied correctly will help to drive institutional adoption. There will be volatility as regulators find their feet but globally we have seen, in general, constructive views on regulation from the US SEC and many regulators have followed their lead. Those issuers that have been disguising equity offerings in ICO form will not survive. Even when an offering is clearly not a security, regulator and legal frameworks globally should provide customary consumer protection while maintaining a balance not to over regulate. The countries with capital control challenges will in the short term have the tightest form of regulation, but this is a prelude to sovereign adoption rather than an attempt to shut down the technology.   We will, of course, have bumps in the road and each asset class as it develops faces significant setbacks, Blockchain assets will not be different. Importantly though the speed of adoption and integration could be unprecedented given the security benefits afforded by the technology. The banks and other trusted intermediaries (see Equifax) have been unable to secure single point databases with security breaches occurring daily at some of the largest and most trusted institutions. Currently, public Blockchains provide us with scale solution to security and the recent upgrade of the Ethereum protocol is instructive in enabling an à la carte privacy solution on public Blockchains. We are already seeing governments beginning to adopt the technology and security is a key driver.For a sub $200 bln industry we have had a huge amount of commentary from senior business leaders, some have demonstrated a lack of knowledge and depth in understanding. More still have demonstrated they are bound by a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to protect their revenue stream. It is notable that the considered comments on the tech from Christine Lagarde and others have tipped the balance back into a more positive discourse. There are of course challenges with Bitcoin which are well documented but we are moving beyond casual rhetoric that its primary use is to facilitate money laundering and has no utility.The global banks have paid more in fines since the financial crises than the total value of global Blockchain technologies. The utility for the global under-banked who possess smartphones and no way to enter the existing financial system is defining. The more interesting story and corporate public discussion are turning around the technology itself and the 40%+ of the Blockchain asset market, which is not Bitcoin. Although still early it is clear that much of the margin in the financial [and other] industries will be significantly reduced as transparency and direct access prove materially advantageous to clients.The market will have substantive, non-trivial issues in all these areas but growing pains are just that and we are at the point where the broader focus needs to be on practical integration and adoption.We are witnessing the start of a move from a state of corporate capitalism to an increasing skew towards individual capitalism. The democratization of finance, as well as other industries, is upon us and tectonic shifts are being felt. As we embrace the new we need to take the R&D from fiat capital markets that have flourished for decades, learn and take the best parts of these forward into a more equitable and transparent future. In concert, the existing oligopolies will need to resize businesses and adjust business models and it is this interplay which will define the breadth and speed of the development of the asset class.   Ronnie Potel is a co-founder of Bletchley Park Asset Management and Radian Blockchain Ventures and has 20 years of experience in financial markets.

Why is Africa Slow on the Bitcoin Uptake?,Darryn Pollock,10/10/2017 15:30,18680,591,"There are masses of potential for Bitcoin in Africa. It’s a monetary system for the unbanked, it’s trustless and far less corruptible, and it can create a new monetary system where there’s no long legacy of banking and financials.However, across the continent, in different countries, the uptake has been surprisingly slow. From South Africa and Nigeria, as the biggest players in Bitcoin, to smaller nations like Tanzania who are seeing big growth, but with small numbers.Perhaps one of the biggest issues facing Bitcoin adoption in Africa is educating people about digital currencies. Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world is still a foggy minefield for those who are actively using it, so it’s difficult to try and educate a whole continentAfrica is largely a cash-based infrastructure with a simplistic model, even banking is still a novel concept to a large portion of the population.However, there’s also not much alternative, if understanding and education in digital currencies is low, their adoption in industry and retail is even lower.Chad Robertson, co-founder and chief executive officer of South African startup Regenize, says awareness will help:“Specifically, in South Africa, we have such a huge gap that keeps on growing regarding wealth, but also knowledge, on the ever-changing tech landscape. If I’m sitting in a coffee shop in the CBD, it’s quite likely someone will know what Bitcoin is. However, head down to the Cape Flats or townships (slums), and it’s highly unlikely that there’ll be many people who are aware of this.”But again, Robertson brings it back to industry. Those who will accept Bitcoin in Africa are even rarer than those in the rural areas that have heard about it.“However, this lack of education and awareness could be drilled down further on to find the root cause. There are too many people living in poverty in South Africa and Africa. They simply cannot think about using Bitcoin, as it’s not relevant to their needs. The local spaza shop (corner shop) does not accept Bitcoin, so how will someone get their bread or milk? Schools don’t accept it for school fees. You cannot buy electricity with Bitcoin to keep your lights on. So why would they care or want to be educated on it?”Of course, Africa is a diverse place, and one that has a huge gap between rich and poor. So while those near the bottom of the economic rung may not have heard of Bitcoin, or see any place to use it, those near the top have other issues.Security concerns also need to be addressed before mass adoption, which also links back to education. Robertson said:“There are many people who’ve been scammed on the Internet, especially those who are digitally uneducated. Therefore, there’s a fear and a stigma around using the Internet as a place to transact.”Visibility is also an issue, with the majority of Africans used to having a brick and mortar institution available for their enquiries.“With Bitcoin, there’s no visible place to lay a complaint or an enquiry. I would think change management would play a large role in the transition from using a bank. For generations, people have given their money to the bank and there’s a trust, as the bank is a brick and mortar institution. With Bitcoin, people might have fears of what happens to my money? Who do I complain to?”",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Africa    #Nigeria    #South Africa    #Kenya    #Bitcoin Adoption    #Education    #Security  
Chinese Exchanges Issue ICO Warnings Amid Death Penalty Panic,William Suberg,6/29/2017 16:10,18442,461,"Fraudulent ICO offerings have become a serious problem in China, with new concerns participants could even face death.As local news source 8btc reports this week, the ICO phenomenon causing a sensation throughout the crypto world could have dire consequences for unwitting Chinese investors.The portal cites two Chinese exchanges, which issued warnings distancing themselves from involvement with non-bonafide token sales.While phrased as useful insights for potential investors, the notices also serve to reiterate their status as fully above board in terms of regulation adherence.One exchange, BTC38, said it “will not list any newly-issued ICO assets” even if it appears they have been classified as legitimate.“It’s one of the principle of BTC38 not to be the first exchange for any cryptocurrency or assets,” 8btc’s translation of its message states.The message was repeated by Yunbi, which sought to clamp down on projects claiming partnerships with the service, none of which exist.“Recently, the ICO market is extremely heated, some of the ICO projects use ""Collaborate with YUNBI"" to advertise their projects which seriously misleads the investors,” a blog post states.Unofficial public fundraising not strictly conforming to finance laws in China can lead to death sentences, with both investors and ICO organizers potential targets.Cointelegraph reminds readers to always perform thorough research before investing in a company with cryptocurrency.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #ICO    #Investments    #Tokens    #Partnership    #Markets    #Cryptocurrencies  
New York Attorney General’s Office Launches Inquiry Into Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms,Ana Alexandre,4/17/2018 22:55,18429,216,"New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman has launched the “Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative”, an “inquiry into the policies and practices” of digital currency trading platforms, according to a press release April 17.As part of the initiative, letters were sent to thirteen major cryptocurrency exchanges, requesting information on their operations, internal controls, and other key issues. Schneiderman said in the statement:“With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money. Yet too often, consumers don’t have the basic facts they need to assess the fairness, integrity, and security of these trading platforms. Our Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative sets out to change that, promoting the accountability and transparency in the virtual currency marketplace that investors and consumers deserve.”As part of an effort to protect cryptocurrency investors and users, and increase transparency in how virtual currency trading platforms operate, a three-page questionnaire was delivered to the exchanges. The questionnaire asks the platforms to provide information such as their approach to fighting market manipulation, operation of bots, usage of non-public trading information, and protection of customer funds.The action reportedly aims to bring average investors a better understanding of the risks and protections associated with cryptocurrency trading platforms. The statement said:“Often, the platforms lack the basic market protections of traditional investing platforms. Moreover, the extent of disclosures to customers about trading rules, internal controls, and other basic practices varies from platform-to-platform, making it difficult or impossible for prospective users to evaluate the actual risks of trading on a particular platform.”Letters were sent to cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Inc. (GDAX), Gemini Trust Company, bitFlyer USA, Inc., iFinex Inc. (Bitfinex), Bitstamp USA Inc., Payward, Inc. (Kraken), Bittrex, Inc., Circle Internet Financial Limited (Poloniex LLC), Binance Limited, Elite Way Developments LLP (Tidex.com), Gate Technology Incorporated (Gate.io), itBit Trust Company, and Huobi Global Limited (Huobi.Pro).",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Cryptocurrencies    #USA    #Government  
Dubai: Gold Trading Company Launches ‘World’s First’ Cold Storage Vault For Crypto,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/14/2018 17:19,32818,551,"The Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC) has given a gold trading company in Dubai the first cryptocurrency trading license in the Middle East, and the company has responded by launching the “world’s first” cold storage vault for crypto, according to a press release on the DMCC’s site.Regal RA DMCC, the company that received the crypto license, is a subsidiary of Regal Assets, which is a gold investment company.Ksenia Kiseleva, manager of the Dubai Regal Assets office, said that Regal RA is planning to apply for crypto licenses in other countries as well, and is currently developing an online trading platform for all crypto-commodities. Kiseleva notes that Regal RA sees cryptocurrencies as a “commodity” instead of a payment method, according to Bloomberg.According to the DMCC, crypto investors trading in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins will be able to store their coins offline in what the company calls the “world’s first deep cold storage for crypto-commodities”. Regal RA’s cold storage vault is touted as one of the “most secure precious metal facilities in the world” and located in Almas Towers, Dubai, the DMCC Free Zone headquarters. DMCC promises crypto assets will be “physically insured” against natural disasters and hacks.Generally, cold storage of cryptocurrencies means that the crypto is stored offline, directly on a hardware wallet, as opposed to a wallet or third-party service connected to the internet that could be vulnerable to attacks or scams.Earlier this month, Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) announced that they are working on regulations for cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), and crypto exchanges, which are as of yet unregulated throughout the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Dubai had already been at the forefront of the Middle East crypto world when it announced in Oct. 2017 that it would be releasing its own local-government backed cryptocurrency called emCash.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Dubai    #Gold    #Tradings    #Cryptocurrencies  
Possible Scam At South African Investment Group Leads To $50 Million Lost,Aaron Wood,3/3/2018 1:08,32573,258,"Nearly $50 mln in crypto assets have reportedly been stolen from investors who put their money into the Bitcoin investment group BTC Global, the South African Sunday Times reported.The sole manager of investments at the company was the forex and commodities trader Steve Twain, from whom investors received irregular payouts until Twain disappeared altogether in Feb. 2018. The Sunday Times reported that BTC Global’s administrative team wrote a post on Facebook two weeks ago, stating they were unable to locate him.More than 27,500 people from South Africa, Australia, and the United States have reportedly been swindled by “one of the biggest Bitcoin scams to hit South Africa”. Captain Lloyd Ramovha of the South African Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known popularly as the Hawks, has confirmed that the Serious Commercial Crimes Unit is investigating claims against BTC Global.""The investigation is in its infancy. I also cannot say whether it is a Ponzi scheme. BTC Global is being investigated for contravening the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act.""Investors deposited their funds into a single wallet address. Ramovha added that the sum of lost funds could increase as more victims come forward. Some investors have reported lost sums of over $113,000.Speaking to the Sunday Times, Antoon Botha of BMV Attorneys based in Bedfordview has confirmed that he has taken on clients who were involved with BTC Global. Following the formation of their arguments and mandates, they plan to take legal action against the company and its representatives.Botha added that there is prima facie evidence to suggest instances of theft, common law fraud, and various transgressions of the Bank Act.Cheri Ward, an administrator at BTC Global, maintains that there has been no fraud, and that investors have received returns and ought to have been aware the risks involved in investing in the fund.“Every single person who invested in BTC Global did so of their own volition and subsequent to having conducted their own research into the fund. As is the case with any fund into which money is invested, there is no guarantee that an investor will be receiving any return on their investment.”Cheri claims that Twain alone controlled and had access to the funds, and that the police are not investigating her regarding the incident.According to Australia’s consumer watchdog the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) 1,200 people filed complaints of crypto scams in 2017.

US: TechCrunch Founder’s Crypto Fund Becomes Yet Another Target Of SEC Crypto Probe,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/3/2018 15:46,31982,444,"TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington’s $100 mln cryptocurrency hedge fund has received a subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of their recently uncovered cryptocurrency industry probe, CNBC reported Friday, March 2.Arrington told CNBC that while it’s true that his Arrington XRP Capital fund received a subpoena, “every [crypto]fund I've talked to has received one.” Emphasizing his willingness to comply with crypto-specific regulations, should they be introduced, Arrington continued:""That's fine. They [the SEC] just have to figure out what they want. They need to set up rules so we can all follow them, and the market is begging them for that.""Multiple news outlets, including CNBC, have reported that a total of 80 firms have already received subpoenas from the SEC.  Arrington’s comments echo those of Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, whose crypto subsidiary was also subpoenaed by the SEC this week. Byrne said he “actually supports” the cryptocurrency enquiries overall, adding:“The more of a regulatory spotlight they bring, the better we look.”However, Arrington mentioned that the lack of clarity from the SEC on crypto-specific regulations has led to originally US-based crypto projects moving outside of the country, which is a “shame”, adding:“The U.S. has just frozen itself.”Jason Gottlieb, a partner at law firm Morrison Cohen representing PlexCorps, whose assets the SEC froze after alleging its “scam” Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was actually a sale of unregistered securities, told CNBC that the subpoenas have come from New York, Boston, and San Francisco SEC offices:""Clearly it's a coordinated, grand investigation. I would expect it's going to continue throughout this year.”Gottlieb added that he sees the SEC probe as ending up with a “hodgepodge of court decisions,"" and believes that the Supreme Court may end up deciding the cases coming out of the probe.In mid-February 2018, the SEC reported that they had suspended the trading of three companies that are related to both cryptocurrency and Blockchain technologies.Earlier in February, during the joint SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) crypto hearing, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that every ICO-issued token the SEC has seen so far should be considered securities and registered as such, but that “true cryptocurrencies” should be smartly and practically regulated.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #TechCrunch    #SEC    #Overstock    #ICO    #CFTC    #USA  
"Is CryptoRuble Back? Launch Set For Mid-2019, Says Russian Blockchain Association",Helen Partz,1/18/2018 15:03,31705,314,"The Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB) has announced that the government’s long-discussed idea for a state-issued cryptocurrency, referred to as the CryptoRuble, will be launched in the middle of 2019.The Russian government has been going back and forth on launching the CryptoRuble (known earlier as the Bitruble) since 2015. As recently as late December, 2017 during a meeting on legislation for digital currencies, the Deputy Minister of Finance and the first Deputy Governor of Russia's Central Bank both stated that they did not think it was necessary for the state to issue its own cryptocurrency.According to Arseniy Sheltsin, the head of RACIB, details of the CryptoRuble project will be officially presented and discussed in July 2018, and the coin itself should be issued a year later. The Government and the Central Bank of Russia are also expected to prepare regulatory measures for Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency mining by July 2018.Early in 2018, one of President Putin’s counselors noted that the CryptoRuble could help the Russian government strengthen the economy by avoiding the impact of international sanctions against the country.According to Russian crypto journal Forklog, the coin is set to be pegged to the ruble, non-mineable, and will be the only legal cryptocurrency in the country. The government hopes the CryptoRuble will attract foreign cryptocurrency investments.Overall, the highest leaders in the Russian government have held mixed to negative opinions towards cryptocurrencies. At a state press conference on January 12, Putin stated:“It is known that there is nothing behind the cryptocurrency, and it cannot be a store of value, it doesn’t have any material value, and it’s not backed by anything...”Russia’s Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, also recently criticized cryptocurrencies at the Gaidar’s Forum in Moscow. He compared the virtual currency trend with the dotcom bubble and suggested that most cryptocurrencies are likely to cease to exist, while Blockchain technology will remain, declaring:“We can not completely exclude the scenario that took place at the beginning of the 90s when many companies arose on the basis of the developing Internet technology and in the beginning of the 2000s those companies mostly disappeared from the scene.  Nonetheless, the technology itself not only survived but currently plays an important role in our life. In a likely manner cryptocurrencies may disappear in several years, but the technology which stands behind them, I mean blockchain, will become a part of our everyday reality. This scenario cannot be denied,”In response to the Russian government’s recent critique of cryptocurrencies the CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of the largest Russian bank Sberbank Herman Gref called on the authorities to not ban virtual currencies. Gref considers both cryptocurrencies and Blockchain to be the “new huge technologies whose power cannot be realized at the moment.” He also declared “in no circumstances should [cryptocurrency] be banned”.Several other countries have also announced plans to introduce their own state-issued cryptocurrencies, such as Venezuela and Senegal.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Putin

US Gov’t Indicts Founder Of Long Defunct Crypto Exchange BitFunder,Guest Author,2/22/2018 1:02,31135,223,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) have officially leveled charges against the founder of the now non-operational Bitcoin-dominated exchange BitFunder, Jon E. Montroll, Wednesday Feb. 21.The SEC released a press statement Wednesday stating that they have charged Montroll, also known as Ukyo, with operating BitFunder as an unregistered securities exchange, defrauding the users of said exchange, and making “false and misleading statements in connection with an unregistered offering of securities.”  The SEC alleges that both BitFunder and its founder Montroll defrauded exchange users by “misappropriating their bitcoins”, operated as an unregistered securities exchange, and failed to disclose a cyberattack which led to the loss of over 6,000 bitcoins.In 2013, hackers exploited a weakness in BitFunder’s programming code to falsely credit themselves with over 6,000 bitcoins. In an effort to recuse himself of the responsibility of having lost what was then about $720,000, today worth over $60 mln, Montroll denied the success of the hackers, and additionally provided false balance statements to SEC investigators.The formal complaint filed by the SEC charges Montroll with violations of the anti-fraud and registration provisions of US federal securities laws. According to the press release, ”[t]he complaint seeks permanent injunctions and disgorgement plus interest and penalties.”The DOJ also announced today Feb. 21, that Montroll has been arrested and taken into custody by the federal government. The DOJ has charged Montroll with two counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice. The counts of perjury and obstruction carry maximum sentences of 5 and 20 years, respectively.Investor protection remains a priority concern for the federal government in these proceedings. Marc Berger, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office stated:“...Platforms that engage in the activity of a national securities exchange, regardless of whether that activity involves digital assets, tokens, or coins, must register with the SEC or operate pursuant to an exemption.  We will continue to focus on these types of platforms to protect investors and ensure compliance with the securities laws.”BitFunder ceased trading on Nov. 14, 2013 amid complaints about delayed and frozen withdrawals of funds, following the August hack. Adding to BitFunder’s woes from the hack, the exchange went bankrupt after, following a ban on US traders, American traders left the platform in droves.At a senate hearing earlier this month, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton noted that, so far, every ICO-issued token the SEC has observed is likely a security under US law, regardless of how the issuer refers to or markets the token. As of December, 2017, Clayton noted that not a single ICO had registered their tokens with the SEC.",15,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Fraud    #USA    #SEC    #Government    #ICO  
Regulation Is Only Hope For Bitcoin: Morgan Stanley,Jon Buck,6/14/2017 16:55,31020,861,"In a move that’s certain to irk lovers of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Morgan Stanley came out with a statement on Tuesday calling for greater governmental control and regulation.The very nature of Bitcoin is as a peer-to-peer non-regulated currency system that allows for greater levels of autonomy for holders. However, the recent meteoric rise of Bitcoin values has led speculators and major financial players into the cryptocurrency market.Morgan Stanley stated that the necessary regulations for different cryptocurrencies might require individual tailoring, depending on the nature of the underlying system. Regardless, however, they made it clear that government regulators are carefully watching the currencies to see what is happening with the market.They said that “regulators are looking to have a master key so all transactions are visible to them.”The very nature of that statement will certainly concern the vast majority of Bitcoin holders, given that the goal of Bitcoin was to have a system that did not require such governmental controls.Regardless of whether Morgan Stanley is right, the big money players on Wall Street have already begun to invest in cryptocurrencies.

Your Guide to Five Major US States and Their Stance on Bitcoin Regulation,Anthony Coggine,6/16/2017 1:00,30882,582,"When it comes to cryptocurrency regulations, lawmakers are jousting with different opinions and viewpoints. Some believe that Bitcoin should be regulated, while others are firm that Bitcoin should be left to its own devices.Before legislators can take action, they must understand the nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is a great challenge because the Blockchain Technology must be understood, as well as its impact on different industries. Even though many experts think that US is a step behind Bitcoin regulation, there seems to be ongoing progress this 2017.Let's take a look at the current regulation landscape in five prominent US States: Washington, Illinois, Hawaii, California, and Florida.Washington legislators have started creating new rules that will encompass Bitcoin transactions. Businesses with digital currency services are covered by these rules. The Senate Bill 5013 clarifies the definition of Cryptocurrency and includes various disclosure requirements on consumer information. The bill will also require online currency exchanges in Washington to maintain a surety bond.The bill was introduced in January and it’s already cleared to be sent to Governor Jay Inslee. Speculations about the bill are mostly positive. Despite this regulation progress, some Cryptocurrency-based startups are having doubts operating in the state. Washington has also applied heavier cybersecurity frameworks.When Secretary Bryan A. Schneider of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) announced a new initiative that contains several Cryptocurrency implications, some factors were clarified. The initiative, known as Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance, was focused on digital currencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and ZCash. The guidance increased the regulation of numerous activities related with digital currencies.According to Ciccolo, the IDFPR and Schneider will continue to deliver unwavering support to the innovation of Blockchain Technology. Ciccolo is also optimistic that Bitcoin technology will contribute to the financial innovation of Illinois.Relying on public leverage, Coinbase – a well-respected Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange – announced that it ceased offering support for customers in the State of Hawaii. The reasons pointed out are the “impractical” regulatory policies concerning Bitcoin in that state. This was based on the notice received by Coinbase, indicating that Cryptocurrency operators must hold case reserves equivalent to the values held by customers.Now that Hawaii is considering a bill that would create a working group focused on analyzing digital currencies and Blockchain technology, Coinbase leaders saw a new glimmer of hope. Once the bill is passed, Coinbase will resume working with regulators. This could mean a positive regulatory development for Hawaii.Recently, California’s Assembly Bill 1123 – a counterpart of New York’s BitLicense – was proposed. Once passed, the bill would enact the Virtual Currency Act – an initiative that would prevent a person from engaging with virtual currency businesses unless that person is officially licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or exempted from the requirement.According to Kuskowski, the proposed bill should not be the direction to go in. Such level of regulation, just like BitLicense, caused New York to lose its prominence and status as a crypto hub. Apparently, with California’s position as tech innovation and startup capital of the world, the regulation will have greater catastrophic effects.Now that Florida House Bill 1379 was passed, many people will be aware of the full definition of virtual currency. The bill will also regulate and prohibit the use of virtual currency for money laundering. The term ‘virtual currency’ was officially added to the main definition of “money instruments” based on Florida’s Money Laundering Act. The bill is now with Florida’s governor and is expected to be signed soon.Kuskowski has also stated that a balance is needed among the side of legislators and Cryptocurrency users. People must also understand that a precise regulatory environment will help businesses in making strategic decisions. This way, many businesses can grow.While most of the states in US prefer to have Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be heavily regulated, there are a few Bitcoin-friendly states such as Nevada where Blockchain transactions are not taxed, Texas and New Hampshire.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Washington    #Nevada    #Hawaii    #Florida    #Chicago  
"Canadian Stock Exchange Launches ‘Fully-Regulated’ Token Funding Platform, ‘Unlike’ ICOs",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/14/2018 14:15,30504,496,"The Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) announced yesterday, Feb.13, that they will soon launch a securities clearing and settlement platform based on the Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain that lets companies raise capital with security tokens.According to the CSE announcement, companies using the Blockchain-based platform can issue Security Token Offerings (STO) to investors as a means to raise capital. Those issuing tokens via the CSE platform will “be subject to full regulation by applicable securities commissions”.The CSE positions their STOs to companies as an alternative to running an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which the exchange misleadingly calls unregulated.The press release notes that the platform will benefit both “large, established companies,” as well as, “start-up entrepreneurs seeking to access the public capital markets for the first time.”In conjunction with the new platform announcement, CSE has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Kabuni Technologies, a Blockchain-based manufacturing platform that tracks 3D printed products, to be the first to issue STOs. Kabuni must first file a prospectus with the British Columbia Securities Commission (BSCE), and if approved, Kabuni’s issuing of an STO would “mark the first time a tokenized security has been listed for trading on a recognized securities exchange.”In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton repeated last week in a Senate hearing that every ICO token that the SEC has seen is a security and thus must be registered with the SEC if it is to be offered to US investors. Clayton said the same thing in a statement December, 2017, also noting that, as of then, not  a single ICO had yet to successfully register with the SEC, allowing them to legally offer securities to US investors.Kodak plans to launch a regulated ICO and offer security tokens to US investors as an “exempt offering” under US law. According to the exemption, the Kodak’s security tokens do not have to be registered by the SEC as long as they are only offered to “accredited investors” — individuals with a net worth of over $1 mln.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Canada    #Stocks    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #ICO    #Tokens    #SEC  
Bitcoin Exchange Bitfinex Gives US Customers the Boot Blaming Regulations,William Suberg,10/17/2017 9:10,29986,392,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has confirmed it will block all US customers from November 9 as regulatory uncertainty bites.In its latest blog post Monday, Bitfinex, which already prohibits US users from becoming verified on its platform, said they should now remove all hosted tokens.“U.S. customers are already barred from receiving financing from other users on Bitfinex’s peer-to-peer financing platform,” it reiterated.“This restriction will remain and, in addition, U.S. individual customers will no longer be able to provide financing on Bitfinex effective November 9, 2017.”Bitfinex’s full exit from the US market has been on the cards for some time as patchwork regulation and difficulty securing “compliant banking solutions” began causing increasing headaches.Prior to its one-size-fits-all approach, the exchange had barred certain US states as and when necessary to stay within the law, often at short notice.As part of divesting US holders of its RRT equity tokens formed from a hack in 2016, Bitfinex added they would be able to sell their entire holdings prior to the November 9 deadline, as well as afterwards by “special arrangement.”Reacting to the news on social media, traders appeared surprised at the scope of Bitfinex’s move while welcoming clarity on an issue that has plagued multiple exchanges serving the country in recent years.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Bitfinex    #USA  
South Korean Cryptocurrency Exchanges Evaluate Self-Regulations,Helen Partz,2/23/2018 19:38,29976,248,"An association of South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges said that it is planning to check if its members are following a set of self-regulatory cryptocurrency measures adopted last year, local journal Yonhap News reported Feb. 21.The Korean Blockchain Industry Association, which is currently comprised of 33 of South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchanges, stated that it is going to carry out evaluations of 21 participants, including major trading platforms Coinone, Bithumb, and Korbit.In mid-December 2017, the Korean Blockchain Industry Association announced that it plans to “establish a set of specific ethical codes on the virtual currency bourses, including insider trading and market manipulation” after the South Korean financial authorities began considering cryptocurrency regulations.The self-regulatory move among South Korean exchanges was intended to provide more transparency in trading to alleviate worries over the country’s “Bitcoin frenzy” in December 2017, during which a sudden influx of South Korean investors started buying Bitcoin.Last week, in the UK, seven of the world’s largest cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, formed the country’s first self-regulating trade body, CryptoUK.

Austrian Finance Minister Considers Pan-EU Crypto Regulation Based On Rules For Gold,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/24/2018 9:40,26970,328,"Austria’s Finance Minister Hartwig Löger is considering basing cryptocurrency regulations on the trading rules already in place for gold and derivatives as a way to prevent crypto from being used in money laundering, Bloomberg reported Friday, Feb. 23.Löger spoke with Portugal’s Finance Minister Mario Centeno about his plans for pan-European Union crypto regulations on this basis yesterday, according to local news outlet Vienna.at.During the meeting with Centeno, Löger discussed an action plan for the EU Commision in Brussels to form a working group in March to accept EU proposals about how to deal with fraud in cryptocurrencies.Löger said, ""the case in Austria is enough for me to take action in this area,"" reported Vienna.at, referring to the recently uncovered Optioment Bitcoin (BTC) pyramid scheme.Löger has also brought up the idea of a Fintech Regulatory Council to be organized by March, where crypto experts will examine how crypto regulation will work with EU institutions.According to Bloomberg, Löger said in a statement:“Cryptocurrencies are significantly gaining importance in the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. That’s an important aspect for the changes we support. We need more trust and more security.”As part of Löger’s plan, crypto investors would report trades of more than $12,300 to the financial intelligence unit, and crypto trading platforms would be supervised by the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA).Additionally, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) would be based on “digital prospectuses” that would need to be approved by the FMA, and regulations against market manipulation and insider trading would be applied to ICOs, just as they already are for share and bond offerings.In a Feb. 23 press release, the FMA Board, Helmut Ettl and Klaus Kumpfmüller, wrote that they “welcome the move by Finance Minister Hartwig Löger to subject cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to regulation and supervision:”""Since digital currencies are essentially a phenomenon of the Internet and are offered there without limits, regulation and oversight of cross-border cooperation are also of great importance, we therefore particularly support the approach of addressing these issues at European level.”The FMA also wrote that they will contribute to Löger’s proposed FinTech Regulatory Council.European Union regulators released another series of warnings in mid-February to consumers, advising them of the high risks and “pricing bubble” characteristics of virtual currencies.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Austria    #EU    #Gold    #ICO    #Finance    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tradings    #Money Laundering  
Colombian Government Still Does Not Recognize Bitcoin as a Legal Currency: Financial Superintendent,Lisa Froelings,6/30/2017 23:19,11971,392,"The Colombian government still does not authorize or legalize the use of Bitcoins for financial transactions, according to Jorge Castaño Gutiérrez, Superintendent, Financial Superintendence of Colombia.The country has no plans to make it illegal, as of today. The top finance regulator clarifies the government's viewpoint in a circular about digital currency last week.The legality of Bitcoin is different in every country. Many have explicitly regulated the use of this electronic currency in different modes of payments while others still do not approve it. Colombia is one of those countries that do not recognize cryptocurrency as a government currency. Gutiérrez reiterates the country’s stance on the digital currency in a circular published last week. According to him, the country's sole monetary unit and unit of account are the pesos printed and issued by the Banco de la Republica, citing Article 6 of Law 31.He went on by including Article 8 of the same law, which states that banknotes and coins must be in the peso and will be the only means of legal payment in the country. Therefore, Bitcoin is not considered a currency of the country because it does not constitute a means of payment or legal tender.Gutiérrez argues that: “Bitcoin is not an asset that can be considered a currency because it does not have the support of the central banks of any countries”.The prevalence of Bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme or investment scams in the country is the other reason for the government's strong opposition. Gutiérrez has warned the public about the potential risks of Bitcoin as well as prohibited banks from dealing with this electronic money.Gutiérrez also said in an interview that those involved in the Bitcoin pyramid schemes in raising money from the Colombians could face up to 20 years of imprisonment.

Philippine Senator Demands Harsher Penalties For Crypto-Involving Crimes After Local Scam,Marie Huillet,4/17/2018 19:35,11900,167,"Philippine opposition Senator Leila de Lima is pushing fellow senators to move forward with her bill to impose stricter penalties for cryptocurrency-related crimes, according to a press release from the Philippine Senate published April 16.De Lima, a former justice secretary, underscored the urgency of Senate Bill (SB) No. 1694, following the arrest on April 4 of two suspects for an alleged local Bitcoin scam involving P900 mln ($17.2 mln):""I hope that this occurrence will push my esteemed colleagues in the Senate to take my proposed bill seriously and help pass it into law soon. Knowing that virtual currency resembles money, and that the possibilities in using it are endless, higher penalty for its use on illegal activities is necessary.”“Higher penalties”, as per SB 1694, would mean that any crime as defined by the country’s Revised Penal Code (RPC) – when committed through and with the use of virtual currency – would be subject to a penalty that is one degree higher than what is currently provided under RPC.In her list of illicit activities that may involve cryptocurrencies, De Lima mentioned:""Estafa where unscrupulous individuals entice unsuspecting people to purchase fake Bitcoins, sending a virtual currency as payment for child pornography, or a public officer agreeing to perform an act in consideration of payment in Bitcoins (direct bribery).”There were only two people involved in the recent alleged Bitcoin scam, and the Senator’s mention of estafa refers to a further bill (SB No. 959) she is currently trying to push through, which would reduce the minimum qualification of a syndicated estafa from five to two persons. Currently, syndicated estafa and other forms of swindling are punishable by life imprisonment to death, according to the press release.Last month, Cointelegraph reported on de Lima’s first moves to introduce SB 1694, which stipulates that the gravity of crypto-related crimes will be judged according to the value of the illicitly raised virtual currency in local fiat, as determined by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).The BSP has recognized Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal payment method in the Philippines since February 2017.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Philippines    #Crimes    #Bitcoin News

“Appropriately Regulated” Crypto Can Trade on Exchanges: Russian Finance Ministry,William Suberg,6/26/2017 14:40,19509,523,"The Deputy Head of Russia’s Ministry of Finance (MinFin) Alexey Moiseev has confirmed cryptocurrencies can legally trade on exchanges.In comments to journalists on the sidelines of a Russian Federation Council meeting, Moiseev said that as long as crypto was “appropriately regulated,” exchanges could trade them.“Theoretically, yes. In cases where they are appropriately regulated, yes,” Rambler News Service quotes him as saying.The comments add a further boost to the Russian cryptocurrency business community, which has developed at a snail’s pace due to years of uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin and its ilk in the eyes of regulators.In late 2016, the situation finally became clearer, with senior banking officials and politicians signaling a desire to regulate, not ban, cryptocurrency within the next two years.Moiseev had previously reiterated the state would treat virtual currency of any nature as “property, not currency.”“A second thing is that the regulatory process should be on the basis of a financial instrument. That is to say our top priority is to pay attention to protecting user rights, AML and terrorist financing laws.”A flipside of Russia’s regulation plans is lawmakers attempting to “track” transactions to the same extent as interbank payments, something on which they are yet to elaborate.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Tradings    #Russia    #Transactions    #Payments    #Law    #Alexey Moiseev  
"New Proposal For Crypto Regulation in Italy: Analysis, Opinions, Context",Matteo Vena,3/2/2018 11:40,19476,291,"The Italian Ministry of Economics is working on a decree that aims to classify the use of cryptocurrencies in the country and to list “service providers related to digital currencies.”Cointelegraph analyzed the draft of the document that aims to introduce new regulations on the use of cryptocurrencies in Italy and talked about the new decree with local business, political, and academic representatives.2018 could be a very peculiar year for the crypto industry: the year of regulations. From East to West, regulators from all over the world are working on new laws for the crypto industry.We have seen a hard-line and prohibitionist approach from China, that aims to heavily control the phenomenon, but also a more reasonable approach from the US, Japan and Switzerland, whose purpose is to create a solid foundation for the development of the industry in the future.Member of the innovation board of the Ca’ Foscari University and the Ascotrade innovation hub, Renzo Taffarello commented on why regulations are developing in 2018:“These decrees are made in this historical period because 1) we saw the increase in value of Bitcoin which led to large increases of ""assets"" associated with Bitcoin, 2) the occurrence of numerous ICOs that see capitalized Start Up, 3) the fact that the use of Bitcoins is entering the traditional economy. 4) finally, the hypothesis that the cryptocurrencies can be used for illicit purposes since they are outside the national jurisdictions.”In this disarray of laws, decrees and confused statements there’s also Italy. The Ministry of Economy and Finance, in the Press Release N°22 released on Feb. 2, stated its commitment to “understand the cryptocurrency phenomenon in Italy in all its aspects.”Mayor of Montegrotto Terme, a city in northern Italy, Riccardo Mortandello, told Cointelegraph:“Many compare the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies to other recent speculative bubbles. But, in my view, there is a substantial error: cryptocurrencies are a clear response of the ""system"" to the moment of supposed overcoming the traditional banking model that in too many cases is no longer aligned with the technologies. But, above all, is no longer aligned with the real needs of people.”As announced on their official website, the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Economy and Finance is working on a decree that aims to explain the crypto-phenomenon in Italy. In particular, the decree will define how and when “service providers related to the use of digital currency” should report their activities to the Ministry.The decree aims to avoid any unlawful activity that could be conducted with cryptocurrencies, most importantly money laundering. However, compliance with anti-money laundering laws when acting with cryptocurrencies on a professional level was already clarified on May 25, 2017, in the Legislative Decree ? 90.The definition of “virtual currency” is explained in the decree as: “digital representation of value, not issued by a central bank or a public authority, not necessarily related to a fiat currency, used as a tool of exchange for purchasing goods or services, and electronically transferred, stored and traded.”Michele Orzan, digital leader (Europe) of the World Economic Forum and president of EuCham (European Chamber), proposes to remove the phrase ‘not issued by a central bank or a public authority’ from the definition of virtual currency, “as various states are about to issue them, and some have already done so.”The new administrative order, available for public consultation up to Feb. 16, 2018, proposed clear ways for reporting crypto activities to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as well as a potential timeline.Who are these “service providers related to the use of digital currency” exactly? As stated in the draft of the decree, it’s any individual or entity that provides professional services, related to cryptocurrencies, such as using, trading, storing or converting.Therefore, any seller who accepts cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for goods, services, or other purposes is required to report their activities to the Ministry, within the time frame and in accordance with the format established by the decree.If one is already operational within the Italian border when this decree comes into effect, he will have to report his activities to the Ministry within 60 days of effective date of the ministerial order.According to the decree, professionals of the industry are required to register on a special list kept by the Institution of Agents and Mediators (OAM  – Organismo degli Agenti e dei Mediatori), which manages lists of financial and credit organizations.Following the effective date of this regulation, in order to report the activities to the Ministry and register to the list, one will have to fill out a form, as seen on the draft of the decree, and send it using a special Italian certified email service (PEC).The form requires general identification data such as name, surname, document data, as well as the address or the website of the business.The official decree will be eventually published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana (Official Gazette of the Italian Republic).After the release of the updated decree on the government gazette, those who operate with cryptocurrencies at a commercial or professional level in Italy, including sellers who accept digital currencies as means of payment, must send a certified email to the Ministry of Economy and Finance.With this information, the government will have a better understanding of the phenomenon and be able to conduct potential inquiries in cases of money laundering or other illegal activities.However, Michele Orzan is not so convinced by the listing initiative: “While certainly, I appreciate the desire to understand the phenomenon (which however could be carried out by a few research companies certainly better and faster), it could end up with the usual Italian flaw: a further bureaucratic request.Moreover, it is useless to ask commercial operators whether they accept or intend to accept virtual currencies: in a few years, all or almost all commercial operators will accept virtual currencies.Finally, paradoxically, it seems as if it’s happening in the previous century: to send forms by certified mail to the state, attach a copy of the document issued by the state itself. In 2018 it makes me smile: it's as if being in bed with my wife, before ...er, partying ... I would ask her to show the copy of my signature that I have affixed to the marriage act myself. You never know …”As clearly stated in the draft of the decree, the data gathered by the Ministry, other than being used for the census, will be made available to the Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) as well as to the Postal and Communications Police, i.e. Italian Cyber Police (Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni), in order to conduct investigations related to money laundering schemes and the funding of terrorism.Renzo Taffarello, expert on internationalization and innovation strategies, specializing in digital platforms and related technologies, commented: “What do the new proposals do? They define the obligation for those who manage cryptocurrency to register on special lists. Basically, people who are financial intermediaries or merchants or others will have to present themselves and inform whether they are part of crypto exchange. It is evident that the government is putting a series of obligations that are the prerequisites for future decrees and regulations of a fiscal nature.”Michele Orzan proposes an alternative way of finding out who is engaged in crypto activity:“Unburden businesses, do not weigh them down with further requests. Given that soon there will be a declaration of income [in Italy], it would be enough to add a small square, ask the question, and tick it (this would cover the majority of companies and individuals who engage in business). In the EU there are cutting-edge countries, such as Estonia: one should learn from the best.”The new proposal highlights the growing interest of the Italian government in regulating cryptocurrencies.Francesco Nazari Fusetti, social entrepreneur, founder of AidCoin and CharityStars, is enthusiastic about the new developments:“Regulators are moving faster than expected all over the world. Surprisingly, Italy is also taking the crypto phenomenon seriously. For Italian businesses, I believe it's positive to have guidelines to be able to operate legitimately in this new industry.""The decree doesn’t introduce new taxes or unusual laws: it just asks sellers and operators in the industry to send a report to the Ministry in order to conduct a census of the activities and tackle potential criminals.Renzo Taffarello, however, thinks that the decree will give way to further regulations:“What can be expected – typically, the Italian government in tax matters has a very bureaucratic approach associated with rules that are particularly difficult to interpret. This could turn into a barrier to the adoption of cryptocurrencies unlike what is happening in other countries in Northern Europe and the world.”For legal businesses, the new decree does not entail any particular sacrifice or burden, so it shouldn’t constitute an obstacle towards the adoption of cryptocurrencies.Regarding criminal activities, which are particularly damaging for the industry, the new decree offers law enforcement agents new tools to fight illegal operations.Riccardo Mortandello, mayor of Montegrotto Terme, sums up:“If the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies will not run out due to some circumstances, it will be particularly interesting to understand its impact on the current economy. Moreover, it is interesting to study how to govern and regulate this phenomenon, which, if not managed properly, could put in danger the existing instruments of monetary policy. While centralization, in the common imaginary, aims at achieving quality of life objectives, the cryptocurrencies instead point to decentralization, which, although obviating the known limits of the centralized, could implicate further problems. A phenomenon that politics must govern even before the bureaucrats or large corporations worldwide.”The interviews were conducted in collaboration with Cointelegraph managing editor, Lucrezia Cornèr.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Italy    #Government    #Law    #Cryptocurrencies  
Fork Supporters Prepare to Implement SegWit2x Fork,Lisa Froelings,11/7/2017 15:10,19194,288,"Fork supporters and developers are preparing to implement the SegWit2x fork by Nov. 16.The new fork is considered as the largest and least understood software to the top-dog virtual currency so far.Under the SegWit2x software protocol, several changes to Bitcoin’s rules will be implemented. The new protocol will specifically change the size of the blocks that are passed regularly around the network and stored in the Blockchain from one megabyte (1 MB) to 2 MB.Bitcoin is just warming up from its recent split that led to the launching of the new token called Bitcoin Cash. The split, however, has limited impact on the leading virtual currency as users were able to receive and exchange both their Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash holdings on certain exchanges and wallets.SegWit2x is similar to the previous forks that were implemented on Bitcoin. It is an alternative software that will be run by network participants and will implement the protocol rules. SegWit2x will be using the code BTC1.If the SegWit2x will be successfully implemented, any user who will not upgrade to the new software will no longer be considered a member of the network. The Bitcoin community is deeply divided over the scheduled implementation of the SegWit2x protocol.Several industry players think that the new protocol will complicate matters in complex and unexpected ways. Among those who are against the new software are the developers and node operators.Email from Daniel Vogel at @bitso clearly describes why Segwit2x utterly fails to upgrade Bitcoin. The point was to not split the community! https://t.co/YYsfewywFVThey claim that SegWit2x is risky and will provide miners and businesses too much power.I just published “Segwit2x Game Theory Scenarios Part 1” https://t.co/klpkfVnBKqHowever, the new software is supported by Bitcoin miners and startup companies. They claim that Bitcoin is a digital currency and should compete against the US dollar and other fiat currencies.They also argue that Bitcoin should be upgraded to be able to compete against other cryptocurrencies that are being used as a method of payment. It is, therefore, interesting to see if this new software will be implemented in the near future.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SegWit2x    #Hard Fork    #Bitcoin Cash    #Bitcoin Gold    #Cryptocurrencies    #Software  
Former Indian Gov’t Official Shaktikanta Das: Crypto “Should Not Be Allowed At All”,Helen Partz,3/12/2018 15:26,19133,253,"Shaktikanta Das, former Secretary of Economic Affairs of India, who is currently a member of the 15th Finance Commission, claimed in an interview with Quartz India that cryptocurrencies should be banned since it is impossible “to regulate [them] effectively,” as reported on March 12.Das, a retired officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), has participated in the development of India’s cryptocurrency regulations as a member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In April 2017, Das headed the first government panel aiming to formulate cryptocurrency regulations for the country.According to Das, the main problem with cryptocurrencies is that they are not backed by any assets. In an interview with Quartz, Das unfavorably compared shares that represent the value of a real company to cryptocurrency assets that are “created out of vacuum” and “thin air.” Das argued that RBI is the only body that is legally allowed to issue currency in India, hence digital currencies are illegal.Shaktikanta Das concluded that there is no way to regulate cryptocurrency “effectively,” and that is why it “should not be allowed at all.”“Let us accept that it would not be possible to regulate it effectively. Because they will do transactions from their houses. You cannot enter every home to check what transactions are going on. So, I think this is a serious challenge, and this should not be allowed at all.”On the other hand, some experts from India believe that the full ban on cryptocurrency would only bring more problems. Anirudh Rastogi, the managing partner at the TRA law firm, said to Quartz that enforcing a ban would make tracking cryptocurrency transactions even harder for the government.Rastogi also claims that India cannot simply ban cryptocurrencies when “two or three of the largest economies are giving it legitimacy,” because that would make the country “an outlier”, which, in turn, will “have an adverse impact” on the financial system.The government of India has taken a negative stance towards cryptocurrencies in recent months. On Feb. 28, cryptocurrency exchanges BTCXIndia and ETHEXIndia halted trading activities, reportedly resulting from government pressure.Back in 2017, India’s Ministry of Finance claimed that Bitcoin and the other digital currencies are “like Ponzi schemes” and warned investors about the high risks of getting involved in cryptocurrencies.",14,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Government  
Jeff Sessions Says Dark Web Use with Bitcoin is ‘Big Problem’,William Suberg,10/20/2017 15:20,18937,557,"US president Donald Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called the Dark Web a “big problem” and hinted at potential future regulatory moves.As part of a testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Justice Department oversight, Sessions responded to a query from California senior senator Dianne Feinstein, who raised the issue of Dark Web crime.“It seems to me that the problem of the Dark Web being used by criminals is going to grow in the coming years,” Feinstein stated.Sessions responded that the phenomenon was “worrying” law enforcement.“We’re very concerned about that, the FBI is very concerned about that,” he said.Discussing AlphaBay, the Dark Web portal the US took down in July, Sessions added that users were “using Bitcoins and other untraceable financial capabilities.”“It is a big problem,” he concluded.The two politicians’ mutual headache over the Dark Web hints at a possible focus for future maneuvers on digital privacy.While the testimony was somewhat erroneously reported by other media resources as anti-Bitcoin, Sessions nonetheless only suggested by association that Bitcoin’s anonymity served criminals’ objectives.Such a perspective is outdated, however, as trends suggest Dark Web users have abandoned Bitcoin in favor of privacy-centric altcoins such as Monero long ago.A broader understanding of Bitcoin is still the topic of debate for US lawmakers more generally, with the situation on the ground for users meanwhile remaining shaky.This week, popular exchange Bitfinex announced it would withdraw from the US market completely by Nov. 9 due to regulatory barriers",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Dark Web    #AlphaBay    #USA    #Politics    #Monero    #Markets  
Bitcoin: What has Washington interested,Eric Barrier,8/22/2013 14:40,38,0,"We have enough examples now to know that Bitcoin has become more of a priority on Capitol Hill.In recent weeks, we have seen the House request a report from the FBI on digital currencies and money laundering, a letter of inquiry to numerous agencies from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and 22 subpoenas from New York’s Department of Financial Services to in-state Bitcoin businesses.The Feds are keeping an eye on Bitcoin.We also now have a judicial precedent that regards Bitcoin as actual currency thanks to a federal judge in Texas.But it might be one step forward, two steps back at this point. The subpoenas in New York may only serve to chill the intentions of local entrepreneurs and stifle innovation.Then, we have to realize that is happening at the state level, and with 50 states comes 50 different interpretations of regulations. Whether any of these will align with opinions at the federal level remains to be seen.The threat always exists that an overzealous US or state government will provide sufficient incentive for American Bitcoin entrepreneurs to set up shop elsewhere. The biggest protection America currently has against this is the sheer amount of venture capital available here.None of this is to say it’s in the government’s interest to squash Bitcoin. The US has a struggling economy and should welcome financial innovation.But the US can also be pretty ham-fisted in its approach to law enforcement and security. The specter of an anonymous cabal laundering money to fund terrorism could wreak havoc.Of course, implementing the regulations we all imagine are coming is much easier said than done.It’s not as if the US can create a Bitcoin Central Bank under its jurisdiction. And this lack of control will only play the fearful — those who fear the eternal threat of crime, and those who fear they won’t get a cut.And Bitcoin itself is designed, to some degree, to circumnavigate regulation. Or at least it cannot fit into existing models of regulation. So if the US lets the balance tip too far toward the pro-regulation side, an awkward cat-and-mouse relationship could develop.That is if Bitcoin entrepreneurs, in that scenario, give the US any regard at all. The currency is international, and 95% the world lives outside of the US.Which means if law enforcement officials want to be able to follow Bitcoin money trails, the US government will need to make the country Bitcoin-friendly. Otherwise, that specter of crime slips outside of its jurisdiction completely.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Washington

This leaves a huge loophole for anyone simply holding Bitcoins or using them to buy goods or services.The IRS technically can tax any Bitcoin income, though.Bitcoin proponents will include the Bitcoin Foundation and Jim Harper from the Cato Institute.Marco Santori, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee, said: “Bitcoin deserves a voice in Washington.

"Pay Up in Bitcoins, Norway Prosecutors Tell Drug Dealers",Jacob J,3/11/2017 10:23,509,310,"Prosecutors in Norway have demanded that drug dealers should pay a penalty in Bitcoins. Does this effectively legitimize Bitcoins?Norwegian investigators had worked with crime enforcement officials across the world while investigating a local drug ring, which sold drugs through the mail. This drug ring was linked to the now defunct Silkroad site, which was shut down by the US police in 2013. The Norwegian police arrested three men in this case in June 2015 and seized large amounts of narcotics and several computers as evidence.The prosecutors have demanded that the men who have been charged should repay their profits in 120 Bitcoins and 3.1 mln Norwegian kroner. Each Bitcoin is worth ~10,000 Norwegian kroner, indicating that the Norwegian government has asked for 28 percent of the penalty to be paid in Bitcoins.It is surprising that the Norwegian government has demanded payment of the penalty in the form of Bitcoins. The accused men were arrested in June 2015 and the value of Bitcoins has increased substantially after that. So by demanding that the drug dealers repay their Bitcoin profits, which were earned in 2013 to 2014, the value of the fine imposed is actually much higher. Crime investigating agencies also require Bitcoins in undercover operations.Although the prosecutors, in this case, have sought for the penalty to be imposed in Bitcoins, they do not accept that this effectively legitimizes Bitcoins. The prosecutors denial may be immaterial. While Norway is not a member of the European Union, it is a member of the European Free Trade Association member and the EU is its most important trading member. The EU has been taken large strides in recognizing Bitcoin. In April 2016, Bitstamp became Europe’s first licensed Bitcoin exchange, after receiving a licence from Luxembourg to operate as a payments institution. Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, Norway cannot operate in isolation.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Norway    #Drugs

Specifically:“While we’re sure that the protection from New York law enforcement is valuable, it comes at a price that exceeds the market opportunity of servicing New York residents. Therefore, we have no option but to withdraw our service from the state. Clients living in New York who wish to continue enjoying our award-winning service are encouraged to escape across the border before the consumer protective walls are erected around the state line.”In addition, bitcoin wallet provider and marketplace Paxful has decided to leave Gotham, and I spoke directly to their CEO about the situation over the weekend. While New York does contain Paxful’s headquarters and a fair amount of their customer and transactional base, they deem the move as necessary, prudent, and best for their business in the long run.“While the BitLicense has made us look at the option of leaving New York, it is no longer the only reason,” Ray Youssef, CEO of Paxful told Cointelegraph. “The more we explored our options the more sense it made. We will spend a few months building a team of core developers overseas before settling down in (Silicon) Valley. Paxful is growing, doubling our development team and will be relocating to the Valley. We've had a 20x growth rate month after month and we have yet to publicly launch.”Other companies taking similar actions recently include Shapeshift, GoCoin, and BitQuick. The reasons cited are numerous, including lack of consumer privacy protection, onerous anti-innovation clauses within BitLicense, and excessive costs for compliance, which has been estimated to be as much as US$40,000.Many of these sites are directing their New York traffic to the Please Protect Consumers website, created by Erik Voorhees.“Us being on the frontline of the BackPage effect is the leading cause of this,” Youssef continued. “In our opinion it is the single biggest thing to happen to Bitcoin for years. This is the first mass market ripple as real working class people are having to learn bitcoin for their survival. We will soon be officially launching our marketplace. We are confident that peer to peer marketplaces like Paxful will be the way the mainstream gets its bitcoin.”BitLicense does have many facets that do help protect consumers and dissuade people from using digital currency for criminal purposes. Ben Tawsky made modifications to improve usability and to prevent this set of regulations from driving business from the state, but it appears to have failed in this regard. Many companies cite clauses such as the following for their decision under Section 200.10 of the revised BitLicense reads the following edicts:Section 200.10 - Material change to business: Each Licensee must obtain the superintendent’s prior written approval for any plan or proposal to introduce or offer a new product, service, or activity, or to make a material change to an existing product, service, or activity, involving New York or New York Residents.Such anti-innovation clauses may only hurt startups looking to grow and build distinct market advantages while also burdening regulators with an endless mountain of paperwork. Government bodies deciding what innovations to allow, and when, can only lead to many conflicts of interests. This also sets a disturbing new precedent that no other technology or financial services industry has had to endure to date.The market has spoken, and time will tell if the grass is indeed greener elsewhere for these leading companies. What is undeniable is the fact that residents and the tax coffers of the State of New York will both suffer due to the unprecedented regulatory actions taken over the last year. Sadly, many other locales may copy BitLicense’s framework out of convenience, without considering the costs of reproducing such restrictive codes of conduct.Meanwhile, according to a report in Fortune magazine, Lawsky registered his new legal consulting startup, The Lawsky Group, in Delaware the day after stepping down in June. Delaware is the country’s number one state to start a new corporation, due to their simple and efficient regulatory environment. His leadership in regulatory authority seems to also beget leadership in moving a new business to higher ground, so he can turn a buck much easier allegations. It seems what is good for the goose may indeed be good for the gander.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #New York    #BitLicense    #Kraken    #Paxful  
6 More Don’ts for Bitcoin Startups,Allen Scott,7/16/2015 16:17,508,0,"Cointelegraph once again reached out to a handful of crypto entrepreneurs regarding their experiences of starting a business in the cryptocurrency industry. In a follow-up to our previous article on “5 Don’ts for Bitcoin Startups,” here are the next six caveats that will help startups get off the ground in this volatile landscape. The most fundamental thing to consider when starting a business is to know whether your product or service is actually needed or whether it will be in demand sometime in the near future. This includes analyzing the market, knowing your target audience, and assessing risk.“Generally, many projects begin development without performing proper research into existing solutions and work done in the academy before delving into developing something that will never work,” explained Synereo CEO Dor Konforty to Cointelegraph.The sentiment was echoed by BTC.sx CEO Joe Lee, who added:“The long-term goal of anyone setting up a startup in this space should be to operate a stable service that is able to serve a growing demand.”“If over time the demand for your service drops, your long-term business model may not be sustainable,” he continued. “One thing this economy needs is stability of the services offered to end users. Focus on this, and the whole ecosystem will thank you.”A perfect example is the 2013 bitcoin price bubble, when many companies in the space rapidly expanded, hired new employees and got ready to “land on the moon.” But after the bubble popped in the wake of the Mt. Gox collapse, the price went on a steady decline and many companies were forced to downsize, including industry giants, such as BitPay, the Bitcoin Foundation and many mining companies. Despite your personal views on state-imposed regulations, shunning compliance will ultimately not only hurt your company, but also your customers.“When it is your own personal self as a sole proprietor, you certainly can make such decisions as disregarding regulations,” explains Ribbit.me CEO, Gregory Simon. “But, when running a business where others are investing in that business, you have a fiduciary duty to protect their investment and to put those investors’ best interests first. That includes diligently following all relevant regulations.”Simon stresses:“Disregarding regulations is playing with fire at best, an illegal break of fiduciary duty at worst. Moreover, becoming an “officially regulated” business in the crypto space will not only get your name in the papers, but it will also instill greater confidence from investors and potential clients.“KYC seems the only way to go for future development and acceptance among the wider public,” adds the CEO of Danish-based exchange CCEDK, Ronny Boesing. “So while a country like Denmark does not require KYC as such, we are still including this as part of our compliance, simply to be ready for the future demand worldwide.”Crowdsales have become “a very innovative way” for startups to raise funds, according to BnkToTheFuture.com CEO, Simon Dixon. However, there are some potential pitfalls here as well, particularly involving compliance and being perceived as a “pump and dump” scam. Dixon explained to Cointelegraph: “Investors should beware, though, that the price of a token in a crowdsale is plucked out of thin air, and once the token floats on a market, it is very common for it to pump and dump until it reaches a fair value, often below the crowdsale price.” Thus, while guaranteeing your investors US$20 per token, for example, might certainly get you some attention, market realities often differ from expectations, so prepare to face the consequences when your promise doesn’t live up to the hype. “I think token sales are only relevant if the token has a clear use in the system you're trying to build,” adds Dor Konforty. “Most crowdsales to date relied on tokens that had zero innate value, including the original Mastercoin one.”But perhaps the most important factor to consider when hosting a Crowdsale is to clearly understand and let the customers know what you are selling. Startups and investors “need to be very careful,” warns Dixon. Selling equity instead of a product might put you at odds with the law, as the nature of the sale changes. Dixon explains:“If the business is using a crowdsale as an alternative to selling equity to investors, then this is a regulated activity that requires [the business] to comply with international securities law.”On the other hand, if the Crowdsale is selling a token that acts as the product, as opposed to equity, “then it can be very useful for raising funds in bitcoin and launching a new token,” he concludes.Banks and other centrally controlled entities are certainly right to fear Bitcoin and, specifically, decentralization. The word has become the rallying cry among crypto-anarchist circles, as well as the ultimate goal of startups that wish to appeal to this emerging segment of security-oriented and tech-savvy users.While complete decentralization is still rather difficult to achieve, decentralizing some of your company’s functions is a good first step towards increasing the security and flexibility of your product or service.""Decentralization is a buzzword that often gets thrown around,” explains Bitnation CEO Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof. “Hence people tend to forget its original purpose. Decentralization does one specific thing; it creates resilience through not having a 'central head' to cut off.” She stresses: “Beyond decentralizing the technology, it's also key to decentralize management, financial distribution, communications, etc. It's a long and difficult process, but it's necessary for long-term survival.”“At Bitnation we estimate that it will take us about five years to reach full decentralization in every aspect of the organization,"" Tempelhof concluded.Simply put, if something goes wrong, decentralized storage of you customers’ private keys (funds), for example, will make a hacker’s life much more difficult, by eliminating the single target where all of the money is kept.“By centralizing operations, you are creating key dependencies which increase what the finance industry calls ‘counterparty risk,’” adds Joe Lee. “While it is still very difficult to decentralize your entire operations and business risks, you can still take proactive measures in developing a successful business where you are a dependency.”Late last year, an anonymous white hat (meaning well-intentioned) hacker uncovered a security problem and stole 250 BTC from vulnerable addresses from online wallet provider Blockchain.info. The story had a happy ending, however, as the hacker returned the coins and everyone learned a valuable lesson: complacency and good security don’t mix. “Obviously it's very important to take into consideration the fact that you're controlling steal-able money online,” explains Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar. “Almost all exchanges thus far have been hacked in some way, and wallet security is still a difficult issue.” He suggests:“Hiring white hats is one strategy; another is limiting one's exposure in case things should go bad; for example, never holding bitcoins online.” Therefore, it’s always better to sleep safe by testing your security under real-world conditions. Keeping your enemies closer by hiring white hat hackers is one of the best ways to ensure greater security. “White hats are an important part of insuring ongoing development, as a counter move to the constant desire from hackers to show what they are not supposed to be doing,” adds Ronny Boesing. We often hear the phrase: “Bitcoin might fail, but the technology is here to stay.” Indeed, while Bitcoin has experienced unprecedented success by being first on the scene, other alternative cryptocurrencies could be only a hardfork away from taking the top spot.Founder of Toast, Aaron Siwoku, warns:“Don't build a business model based on your opinion that bitcoin will become the world’s new currency of choice.”“Do build a business model on the opinion that the blockchain will be a new paradigm in the distributed connectivity of financial services and their associated liquidity liability,” he adds.Despite its immense potential, Bitcoin might not be the panacea to all of our financial problems. Thus, betting all your chips on Bitcoin could become a grave mistake down the road when Ripple, Bitshares, “Dollarcoin,” etc., emerge as the new fan favorite, as bitcoin is unable to overcome its scaling issues, for example, and fizzles out.  Another thing to consider is the specific market niches that can be wrested from bitcoin by other alternative currencies with specific use-cases, such as increased anonymity, or a coin designed for a specific industry. This will become increasingly important in the future, as the millennial generation continues to transform traditional banking, and cryptocurrency gains legitimacy.“Just as in any other industry, different consumers have different needs,” explains Gregory Simon. “I expect [Bitcoin] will always be around to meet a specific market need, but not the entire market’s needs. [Bitcoin] won’t fail. On the contrary, it will continue to grow, but it will likely become a smaller and smaller share of the more rapidly growing distributed ledger industry.”He concludes:“As an entrepreneur, be cognizant of the entire of the distributed ledger industry and the potential opportunities that may exist there for your business beyond Bitcoin.”",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Crowdsales    #Decentralization    #Startups    #Dor Konforty    #Joe Lee    #Ronny Boesing    #Gregory Simon    #Simon Dixon    #Aaron Siwoku    #Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof    #Sergej Kotliar  
Russia Bans Mobile Payment to Bitcoin-Accepting Presidential Candidate,Joseph Young,1/25/2017 13:35,507,264,"The Central Bank of Russia has officially requested Yandex, the largest Internet company in Russia, to disallow Alexei Navalny, a Russian lawyer and financial activist who is running a presidential campaign in 2018, from raising funds using the Yandex payment application.Yandex N.V. operates the largest search engine and provides the most widely used financial service in Russia. It controls over 60 percent of the Internet market share and serves over 55 mln active users. Its financial application is used by the general Russian consumer base to process basic payments, from salaries to purchases at local stores and e-commerce platforms.In mid-December of 2016, Navalny officially announced his presidential campaign through social media and his YouTube channel, which has nearly 330,000 subscribers. Over the past few years, Navalny maintained an active viewership on his YouTube channel and social media platforms, such as Twitter, due to his strong stance against current Russian President Vladimir Putin.Along with the announcement, Navalny released a website called Navalny.com, on which he shared the specifics of his presidential campaign with his supporters and also to accept online donations.At the time, Navalny’s campaign was welcomed by the cryptocurrency community for accepting Bitcoin donations. In a country with relatively low bank account and credit card penetration, it seemed like the most practical method for receiving donations from his supporters.Within a month after the announcement of Navalny and his presidential campaign, the Central Bank of Russia ordered Yandex to block payments being sent to Navalny to fund his campaign.The Financial Security Service of Russia, known as the FSB, confiscated the information of individuals who sent donations to Navalny and blocked 12,366 transactions. In a blog post entitled “Where the money is” posted on the official website of Navalny, he stated that most of the donations were blocked, with the exception of Bitcoin payments.To date, Navalny and his team received nearly $22,500 worth of Bitcoin payments. That is, 24.7 Bitcoins sent within the past 30 days in 249 transactions.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Yandex    #Politics    #Government    #Payments  
OECD: Simply ‘Discussing’ Bitcoin Illegality is Mutually Damaging,Brian Cohen,11/3/2015 11:01,504,0,"On October 26, 2015, The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an organization “created as an economic counterpart to NATO,” held a hearing on disruptive innovation in the financial sector.An unclassified document published as an “Issues Paper” entitled “Refining Regulation To Enable Major Innovations In Financial Market” was prepared by Dr. Sean Ennis, a Senior Economist in the OECD's Competition Division on behalf of the Secretariat (for the 60th meeting of Working Party No. 2) was obtained by Cointelegraph. The topics discussed were peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding of equity, virtual currencies and innovative payment/currency exchange solutions.The report notes that:“Perhaps the most significant overall development in financial market innovation between 2002 and 2013 is, and will continue to be, the expansion of market-based finance, sometimes referred to as ‘shadow banking,’ which has increased in value of assets from about USD 25 trillion to more than USD 75 trillion over this period.”It goes on to say that:“[…] [The] ultimate focus [of this issues paper] is to point out areas where regulation restricts development of innovation. In the case of market-based finance, however, regulation has not restricted the development but rather expanded it (by having higher regulation of banking and certain other regulated activities, while leaving the shadow banking system largely unregulated).”And with that said, Cointelegraph will focus on a particular note in the report -- while seemingly balanced contains a highly charged claim about illegal uses of Bitcoin and how that might be interpreted by government institutions.First, it should be noted that the report may (or may not) not reflect the views and opinions of OECD:The opinions expressed and arguments employed herein do not necessarily reflect the official views of the Organization or of the governments of its member countries.And further, the paper disclaims an interpretation of jurisdiction:This document and any map included herein are without prejudice to the status of or sovereignty over any territory, to the delimitation of international frontiers and boundaries and to the name of any territory, city or area.However, this is not OECD’s first encounter with Bitcoin. In a 2014 article for CoinDesk, Jon Matonis, then Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation wrote “Why the OECD Needs to do its Homework on Bitcoin.” In regards to a working paper issued by OECD entitled “The Bitcoin Question: Currency Versus Trust-less Transfer Technology”, Matonis reported that:“[...] the paper represents one of the first official analyses on bitcoin in the context of contract law, legal tender, and plenary powers. Besides grossly misunderstanding the economic nature of bitcoin, the general prescription for public policy would be disastrous, accelerating a 'parallel' monetary system faster than normal and simultaneously depriving millions of people of seamless participation.”The Issues Paper contains a mind boggling claim that illegal uses of Bitcoin could lead to its outright ban:""As a result of the apparent anonymity of transactions, some users of virtual currencies were involved in improper and illegal activities, including money laundering and transfer of value for illegal goods. As a result, certain governments have sought to take measures that effectively rule out its use as a currency. These create a clear and implied possibility of government’s declaring the virtual currencies illegal (with foot note 35)”Footnote 35 goes on to say:""Even if a virtual currency is not declared illegal, discussing the possibility that a currency could be made illegal damages the mutual confidence in the future value of the virtual currency that is necessary for both parties to a transaction to regard it as serving as a store of value.""A bold claim especially when not put in a broader and greater context. Perhaps the OECD forgot to consult the European Union?In a Best Practices Guideline” The OECD notes that there is a “Joint OECD/EU Initiative” for “Better Regulation in Europe - The EU 15 project”:“Better Regulation improves economic and social welfare prospects, underpins growth and strengthens resilience The EU15 project assessed capacities for effective regulatory management across the EU, through individual reviews of fifteen member states, covering half the OECD membership.”The European Union produces the “European system of accounts” or ESA 2010 for a “reliable and comparable statistical description of the economies of the Member States and the Union itself.”ESA 2010 contains a section “Borderline Cases” which requires inclusion and reporting of so called illegal trade in its respective members Gross Domestic Product (GDP):The definition of a transaction implies that an interaction between institutional units be by mutual agreement […] Illegal economic actions shall be considered as transactions when all units involved enter the actions by mutual agreement […] Thus, purchases, sales or barters of illegal drugs or stolen property are transactions, while theft is not.Indeed. According to The United Kingdom’s “Civil Service Quarterly” The Blue Book from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) describes economic activity in the UK include spending on prostitution and drugs for the first time in 2014.  And further:“The national accounts provide the essential framework for producing many of the key statistics on the economy that appear in the media every day. As well as familiar numbers, such as the rate of economic growth measured by changes in GDP, the national accounts offer a rich mine of information on a huge range of transactions carried out by households, companies, and government. These are vital for policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding how the economy is performing.”The United Kingdom is not the first to report on black market transactions to conform with ESA 2010.Last year the Economist reported in “Sex, drugs and GDP Italy’s inclusion of illicit activities in its figures excites much interest” that:“The announcement […] by Istat, Italy’s statistical body, that […] it would include drug trafficking, prostitution, and alcohol-and-tobacco smuggling in its economic-output numbers has generated a stream of sniggering headlines. To some, it smacks of 1987, when Italy started taking account of its shadow economy, the off-the-books business which makes up about a fifth of Italian GDP. As a result, the economy grew by 18% overnight, surging past Britain to be the West’s fourth-largest economy […].”Returning to the OECD Issue Paper, which states in a footnote that “discussing the possibility that a currency could be made illegal damages the mutual confidence in the future value of the virtual currency” because the currency was involved in “improper and illegal activities” should be taken in a greater context that many of these so called illegal activities are of “mutual consent,” and therefore make up the GDP of a nations, which reflect the economic health of a nation.Is it not like saying that discussing the possibility that the U.S. dollar might one day go to a cashless might destroy the confidence in holding U.S. dollar (because of certain benefits of physical currency). And further, if all or at least a majority black market or illegal uses of any other national currency were eliminated though greater technological control  of that currency, what impact would it have on their currency or economy for that matter?According to The OECD its mission is to:""[…] help governments achieve sustainable economic growth and employment and rising standards of living in member countries while maintaining financial stability, so contributing to the development of the world economy. Its founding Convention also calls on the OECD to assist sound economic expansion in member countries and other countries in the process of economic development, and to contribute to growth in world trade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis.""",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #OECD    #EU    #Economy  
"Banks Should Embrace Blockchain, Not Oppose It: Matthias Klees",Frisco d'Anconia,2/4/2017 9:29,503,533,"Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who is also part of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, has recently called for sweeping regulatory oversight of the Blockchain. Weidmann is convinced that fintech has immense potential to threaten financial stability and the banking sector.Cointelegraph decided to sort the views of Matthias Klees, a former advisor in Brussels and CEO of EuropeCoin about this.Cointelegraph: What's your response to Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann's call to regulate Blockchain and distributed ledger since it poses a threat to the Banking industry?Matthias Klees: Well, it's funny to get a recommendation from Jens Weidmann, CEO of the bank, named ""the most dangerous bank for world economic stability,"" by the IMF, two years ago. But let us dig deeper and forget about banker bashing. His speech is part of a broader discussion dialog, started by an IMF report in the beginning of 2016.If you read the IMFs statement, you will see a deep and clear understanding of Bitcoin and of Blockchain technology and you will see an unexpected support to embrace this innovation. Jens Weidmann's call is the expression of some fundamental disagreement with this IMF report. He can't really hide, he would love to stop Bitcoin and to preserve Blockchain for the banking business and his anger to find out that the IMF didn't care about his desire.Also, because he can predict Bitcoin to be embraced by the IMF and Deutsche Bank in risk to lose its impact, he tries to position himself between Bitcoin and the IMF as an ""oversight institution."" He highlights the capabilities of Deutsche Bank in the field of monitoring and market analytics and hopes to get in the middle of IMF, EZB, and BIS, to get more control. You have to keep in mind that Deutsche Bank currently has to deal with countless penalties for its unlawful market activities.As a result, Deutsche Bank has to pay fines in an amount that could be seen as an existential threat to this institution. Jens Weidmann is aware that Deutsche Bank can't afford to get irrelevant to the monetary system.CT: Is there any possibility such calls from Weidmann could harm the fintech industry?MK: No, though Deutsche Bank has a strong impact on decision making it has been facing its total loss of trust and its worst economic status ever. So at the moment, Deutsche Bank has to get rid of its ""bad actor"" status.Given their powerful data analytics capabilities, Jens Weidmann may likely succeed to establish his bank as a market monitoring and oversight institution. He will just be able to provide advice and reporting. Deutsche Bank is too deep involved in fintech to be able to use this position in a harmful way.CT: Do you think instead of the banking sector fretting over the impact of Blockchain and fintech they should embrace the technology?MK: The commercial banks are knowing, they are regulated, too inflexible and too slow to adapt to this revolution. They could have done right by embracing it early enough. But they did not do that and now they are doing right to fear their own future.In contrast, international institutions like IMF, BIS, EZB, FSB,  don't have to fear to lose their positions like the commercial banks have to. They don't care what money they are using while doing geopolitics. They are feeling rather safe and their speech matches up to that fact by embracing this useful technology.This difference is an interesting new fact: You are witnessing Bitcoin demonstrating its ""soft-transitional-power"" for the first time on the international monetary level, by creating a split of interests between monetary institutions and conventional banking business.CT: Are these fears and reservations in the interest of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology?MK: No, of course not. Banks are powerful institutions with great resources. They would have been much more useful as a partner.And still, it is in our interest to include them as much as we can instead of creating a new powerful enemy. We should never forget to stay on the path of Bitcoin as an unaggressive revolution in favor of a smooth tradition.CT: How does the future look like?Banks have no intention to stop this industry. They know better than anybody else that it is too late to try. Their concerns are just emerging from their efforts to position themselves in this coming environment.Banks will continue to put money into this economy and will, in that way, reach a point where the smooth transition will be in their own interest. Whether we or they like it or not: They will be one of us sooner or later.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Central Bank  
"Despite Rising BTC Price, Bitcoin Yet to Become Totally Independent",Iyke Aru,2/21/2017 17:18,498,283,"An arm of CDIN that focuses on protecting the public from toxic assets and combating criminal activity in the cryptocurrency space and Blockchain, the Nigeria Blockchain Alliance, hereinafter NBA, has recovered the funds of several individuals who had fallen victim to bad actors within the space who attempted to defraud them.The NBA group brings together forensic experts, cyber security professionals, law enforcement agents and legal practitioners among others with the major goal of addressing the misperceptions about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The NBA also leverages on the industry's good faith efforts to cooperate with each other in combating e-fraud as it intends to promote an approach to enforcement and regulation that does not stifle innovation.Cybersecurity expert and a member of the NBA, Obiora Awogu tells Cointelegraph about the efforts of his team in fighting crimes associated with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in Nigeria. Awogu notes that the successes recorded by the NBA have been in collaboration with relevant government agencies and institutions.Awogu says:“We had received complaints about several cases of cryptocurrency scams and have recorded success in investigating these frauds and helping the victims get their money back. All of these have been achieved with the support and collaboration of regulators, LEAs and financial institutions.”Ifeanyi Obodoeze, currently on National Youth Service in Kebbi state is one of the beneficiaries of the actions of the NBA. Obodoeze tells Cointelegraph about the alleged scam he was robbed of NGN 118,750 as he attempted to buy Bitcoins from an acclaimed seller.The culprit with whom Obodoeze connected in a social group on telegram had negotiated to sell $250 worth of Bitcoins to his victim at NGN 118,750 but acted otherwise after receiving credit.“We had agreed on the terms of transaction before I transferred NGN 118,750 to the seller. To my disappointment, he sent me just $2 instead of the $250 after which he blocked every means of my contacting him,” says Obodoeze.Obodoeze says that on recommendation, he sent an email to the official NBA email address with every detail of the transaction. All it took was a space of five days and he had his funds returned in full at no cost whatsoever.Obodoeze expresses joy not just at the quick recovery of his stolen funds but also on the lessons he has learned through the NBA on ways to protect his wealth.Fatore Adebayo also tells Cointelegraph that through the NBA, one of the fraudsters who allegedly scammed him in the guise of selling Bitcoins was tracked down and arrested. This he said was possible through yet another recommendation by a friend who is in touch with the CDIN.The dynamics of petty scams within the cryptocurrency ecosystem is an ongoing concern. Tracking down the alleged fraudsters has involved the collaboration of regulatory agencies and financial institutions. This is possible due to the KYC systems of these agencies and to some extent of law enforcement by relevant government agencies.Placed side by side with the quest for privacy and anonymity by a larger part of the Bitcoin society resurrects the continued argument about the extent of government participation within the ecosystem.Olakunle Peter Taiwo, a member of CDIN explains that Bitcoin is a private currency that cannot be controlled by the government. However, he notes that regulation is important for the benefit of usability of Bitcoin, which naturally affect its price and its store value.Taiwo says:“Bitcoin cannot be controlled government, it is companies and users that will be affected by the activities of government regulations. Regulations, just like what the NBA is doing in protecting the Nigerian public from criminal elements or toxic products and services in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem.”Taiwo concludes by saying that regulation is important to monitor not the Bitcoin but various players within the crypto-ecosystem. It is, therefore, essential to note that until Bitcoin goes mainstream and acquires a high level of independence from existing systems, government intervention remains inevitable.The need to exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for fiat money will always introduce a third party into the cycle of most transactions thereby denying an absolute peer-to-peer expression of the system until massive adoption is achieved.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Nigeria    #Cryptocurrencies    #Security    #Fraud    #Government  
US Crowdfunding Deregulation Opens the Gates for Crypto-Equity,Juan S. Galt,4/30/2015 9:42,487,0,"New U.S. SEC Regulation A+ rules regarding equity crowdfunding coming to effect at the end of May 2015 are set to open the gates for crypto-equity and small business crowdfunding, no investor accreditation necessary. In what can only be called the deregulation of the securities rules that affect equity crowdfunding, the U.S. federal government's SEC voted on key changes to the JOB's Act passed by Obama in 2013.The changes, which have been called Regulation A+, lower the barrier of entry for investors, who no longer have to be accredited investors, or those with a net worth of US$1 million, or a history and expectation of annual income above US$200K per year. Come the end of May, there will be no requirements whatsoever.This is equivalent to opening Troy's gates to anyone who wants to waltz in and set up shop inside. No longer do the gates only open to aristocrats, very successful entrepreneurs or well-connected politicians. Though, as you might expect, there is a catch. A toll at the gates requires issuers to submit reviews of their finances to the relevant authorities, depending on how investors file for compliance.In short, issuers can raise up to US$50 million in a 12-month period for Tier II filings and up to US$20,000,000 for Tier 1. Those under Tier II are subject to review from the SEC and are not subject to individual state law. Those under Tier I are subject to a coordinated review effort called NASAA, conducted on behalf of individual states.The good news is that while issuers will need to be cleared by the relevant authorities before sales are deemed compliant, issuers also have some leeway to test the waters. As Crowdfund Insider put it:“An issuer can ‘test the waters’ and see if there is interest in the offering prior to spending the time and money to [be approved by authorities].  This would be ‘Preview’ mode on SeedInvest where investors can express interest, but can’t yet invest. This is important so that companies don’t have to gamble on their fundraise and can see if there is interest prior to investing in legal and accounting fees.”This huge development for crowdfunding platforms presents a massive opportunity for funding technologies powered by the blockchain. While decentralized crowdfunding platforms such as Swarm, NXT, Omni, etc., are generally not capable of enforcing compliance, they could facilitate it by offering or partnering up with appropriate legal service providers.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #crowdfunding    #security    #US government  
Bitcoin Set to Become a ‘Global Currency’ in Australia,Evander Smart,8/5/2015 14:15,485,0,"A new inquiry from the Australian government is looking to change current tax codes for Bitcoin in Australia, which are proving to be controversial and counter-productive, hurting businesses and growth. The initiative seeks to establish similar progressive standards as in nations like the UK, Canada, and Singapore, where Bitcoin is considered money.Bitcoin regulation has been, and will continue to be, a hot topic as it continues to gain momentum and interest in personal and corporate finance, worldwide. This issue has been a main focus of the Australian Senate over the past year, as bitcoin is becoming an increasingly popular commodity in the Oceanic country.It is attracting business to the nation, and bitcoin ownership in Australia is among the world’s highest per capital, with 7% of the world’s bitcoin circulation running through the continent nation.The problem recently has come with the addition of the GST, or Goods and Service Tax, levied on Bitcoin transaction by Australia’s Taxation Office last year. This labeled Bitcoin an “intangible asset” causing a double-taxation effect for Bitcoin businesses.Coinjar recently moved their operations from Australia to the UK due to the effect of these new regulations. The United Kingdom has excluded bitcoin from VAT (Value Added Tax), which has attracted many companies, with London becoming a global hub for Bitcoin business activity.Coinjar CEO Asher Tan told IBTimes:""If it is defined as a global currency, this would be a positive step to encouraging the bitcoin market to continue innovating. The Australian bitcoin market will significantly improve.”Primarily, the current GST levy causes Bitcoin users to pay a tax when they buy the digital currency initially, and pay another tax when they make a purchase with the currency. These recommended revisions, expected officially next week, would simplify the tax code for users and businesses dealing in the currency, hence making it more attractive, overall.""The opportunities for trade, investment, high salaries and world-leading skills are far more important [than any potential loss of revenue], and I urge the states to work with the Commonwealth to make what amounts to simple change,"" Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, told the Australian Financial Review. “Without a doubt, the main benefit will be the confidence and certainty that removing a GST will provide to our own digital entrepreneurs, and the foreign businesses who want to set up here. The Treasury ministers need to work with the states to make the changes necessary to bring our legislation into the 21st century.”One unfortunate downside is the alleged threat of money laundering and terrorism financing. This potential will be mitigated by all Bitcoin and digital currency companies having to catalog all users through the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center. This will make it easier for Bitcoin businesses to “better identify and mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing risks in the conduct of their transactions.”Given these developments and the risk of losing business investment is forcing Australia’s hand. While they can lead, follow or get out of the way, Australia appears to have chosen to follow, though it is encouraging that they are betting on Bitcoin’s economic benefits moving forward.Unfortunately, all Australians who use bitcoin being treated like a potential criminal is baked into the cake by the authorities. Interestingly, similar measures are not taken when using Australian dollars for any transaction, underscoring the inherent freedom and benefits of using cash as an option. It appears freedom from persecution and bitcoin cannot seem to get on the same page in The Land Down Under.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Coinjar    #Cash  
Is The P2P Era For Cryptocurrency Exchange Coming To An End? (Op-Ed),Charlie Richards,5/7/2015 13:44,485,0,"As the digital currency sector faces increasing scrutiny from law enforcement and regulatory authorities, are the days of peer-to-peer services numbered?The enthusiasts that have driven the development of digital currencies such as Bitcoin over the years often did so without the support of commercial solutions to the problems and needs of the community. As more and more companies have entered the digital currency space however, the requirements of those who want to spend, send, or save cryptocurrencies are increasingly well served by these professional offerings.A trend developing in the digital currency sector therefore is the possibility that the peer-to-peer platforms and systems that have helped grow digital currencies to this point may now be starting to die away, as the slicker – and more rounded – commercial start-ups move in.The inescapable financial nature of Bitcoin transactions means that issues such as security, compliance with regulations, and reliability, are at the front of many users’ minds. Back in February of this year Cointelegraph reported about the growing number of scams and money laundering accusations surfacing around the popular LocalBitcoins exchange platform.The peer-to-peer nature of the service meant that when two Florida based users unwittingly sold bitcoins to undercover police officers, the pair of them were charged with operating an unlicensed money transmission service. Security, and compliance, can only be so effective when the last link in the chain is a private individual on the ground.With the sector facing increasing interest from both law enforcement and financial regulators, such as in the case of New York's soon-to-be-published BitLicense, the need to meet these rules and regulations becomes more and more important. Both for the service operators, and also for the users themselves.In the case of exchanges offering the kind of BTC to local fiat currency service that LocalBitcoins established itself in, a growing number of well-organized startups are jumping into the space.In Europe especially where we see growing popularity for Bitcoin in the non-euro eastern European countries, the small user base means it's not always reliable for users to try and find someone locally who is willing to exchange digital currency for the national currency. This growing need is being met by ambitious startups, rather than through slow organic growth of peer-to-peer services.We spoke to co-founder Bram Ceelen from the commercially run exchange platform Anycoin Direct, to ask about the advantages of the commercial setup over P2P.Cointelegraph: What type of problems can a service like Anycoin Direct solve for digital currency users which are still present in a peer-to-peer service like Localbitcoins?Bram Ceelen: The advantage of using Anycoin Direct over P2P services like Localbitcoins is that transactions will be completed faster, more cost effectively, and also it reassures you that you know you're transacting with a trusted party.CT: In terms of the structural differences of your offering compared to a peer-to-peer service, what features make transactions safer for users security wise?BC: The main reason transactions on Anycoin Direct are safer is that we don't store customers’ funds (coins or fiat) and therefore eliminating the user’s third party risk for the storage of funds.Regardless of the advantages of the increasingly dominant commercial services however, it also likely that a core of digital currency enthusiasts most excited about the ideal of a distributed, decentralized currency will always opt for the most decentralized solution to their needs.A shrinking user pool for these peer-to-peer platforms nonetheless may make this an increasingly unattractive option for more practical users of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, further driving the growth of similar commercial options.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Anycoin Direct    #Digital Currency    #P2P services    #LocalBitcoins  
Legal Basics: Owning and Using Bitcoin in the United States,Armand Tanzarian,6/6/2014 15:00,485,0,"The question of how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general fit into the American legal system at the federal and state levels is a great one, and that’s currently a burgeoning field of law in its own right. In short, it is legal to own, mine, trade and make purchases in Bitcoin anywhere in the United States. But that barely scratches the surface of the issue. Let’s explore some of the legal facets of Bitcoin use in the US. The United States operates as a confederation of 50 states or commonwealths, plus Washington DC and a handful of protectorates and other territories. That means that laws apply at two levels at least: The central federal level, and the state/territory level. This makes regulation of a currency that already disregards national borders a nightmare in the US. There are no fewer than five major regulating bodies at the federal level, plus whatever else becomes applicable at the state level. These bodies include:   Individual states have their own laws regarding property taxes and money transmitters. New York and California, in particular, have strict money transmitter licensing laws. New York has already begun taking applications for so-call “BitLicenses,” and the Texas Department of Banking has classified Bitcoin and other “virtual currencies” as not money. Bitcoin doesn’t respect any nation’s borders, so the law doesn’t pertain to anyone dealing in that currency, right? Not so fast. You’re going to have to claim your Bitcoin gains on your taxes. (Note: Lying on your taxes is fraud, a felony, so we highly, highly recommend you not try this.) IRS Notice 2014-21 sets out all your tax obligations. If you earn any income of exchanges, transactions or mining, you have to report that. Income from mining constitutes normal income, but “[If] the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer,” then you will have to pay capital gains taxes from any money you make on exchanges. For further information on money transmission regulations, take a look at the FinCEN Official Guidance, FIN-2013-G001, issued Mar 18, 2013.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #IRS    #FinCEN    #BitLicense    #BitLegal  
Bitcoin Reaches All Time High Daily Trading Volume at $5 bln,Joseph Young,11/3/2016 10:45,479,962,"Bitcoin reached its all time high daily trading volume at $5 bln earlier this week, primarily because of the current regulatory policies on Wealth Management Products in China. The rapid surge in daily trading volumes allowed the Bitcoin price to reach a multi-month high, surpassing $733 in most markets.Various investors and experts including Chris Burniske, analyst and Blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, suggested that the majority of high-value trades are initiated by buyers in China.Of late, #bitcoin's reported daily trading volume > $5 billion USD. All time highs, China driven. https://t.co/fYcPH76v0F pic.twitter.com/H65u4dfWQTAt the moment, most, if not all, Bitcoin price valuations are based on US and European markets. BraveNewCoin (BNC) is a digital currency data provider that offers a balanced overview of global Bitcoin market data. On BNC and leading Chinese Bitcoin exchanges including OKCoin and BTCC, the price of Bitcoin has remained consistent at 5,000 CNY over the past few days. Its neighboring markets and countries including Japan and South Korea demonstrate a substantial difference in value compared to the US and Europe.One of the major factors that are pushing Bitcoin trading volumes and price range to all time and multi-month highs is the tightening of regulations on wealth-management products in China.Due to strict currency and capital controls, Chinese investors often prefer to invest in wealth management products (WMP). With the attempt of the Chinese government to steer investors away from its real estate bubble, the popularity of WMPs has never been higher.However, the government has begun to crackdown on these WMPs as well recently, which caused investors to search for other alternatives.Bloomberg states that around $1.9 trln of assets are currently invested in Chinese WMPs. If a small portion of those investors decide to store their in Bitcoin, a staggering amount of $1.9 bln will be injected into Bitcoin trading.Although, most of these multi-million dollar trades are processed in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, the rapidly increasing trading volumes and market cap of Bitcoin suggests that the demand for the digital currency in China is steadily increasing.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Tradings  
Bitcoin Pyramid Schemes Helped by Lack of Regulation in India Startups Claim,William Suberg,3/13/2017 15:40,476,217,"India’s as yet unregulated cryptocurrency arena is giving rise to “Bitcoin-based pyramid schemes,” it is alleged.As Livemint reports Monday citing local crypto startup spokespeople, “small-time traders are taking advantage of the absence of rules” to create “multi-level marketing (MLM) or pyramid-like schemes with Bitcoin as the base product.”“People form companies that promise lucrative returns and indeed give them for the first few months,” Zebpay co-founder and chief executive officer Saurabh Agrawal told the publication.“This is in exchange for bringing in more members under them who will buy Bitcoins and bring in newer members. This goes on till it explodes and the people lose all their money.”While neither Agrawal nor fellow interviewee, Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath, explicitly named an example of such schemes allegedly operating in India, cryptocurrency’s legality in the country remains a problem.A legislative vacuum is countered by frequent government and central bank warnings on supposed dangers of using Bitcoin and its ilk, these accompanying a currency crisis which after four months is still causing headaches for consumers.Such mixed signals put India on par with jurisdictions such as Venezuela, where authorities have not banned cryptocurrency but appear to selectively penalize its operators.Meanwhile, Monday, at last, saw cash withdrawal restrictions lifted in India as supplies of new banknotes slowly increase.Zebpay and Unocoin are among the first local Indian Bitcoin exchanges. Both resources have seen marked increases in use since the currency reforms and recently announced a plan to self-regulate the market through their own association.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Zebpay    #Unocoin  
Cato Institute's Mark Calabria: ‘Expect Another Crisis Within the Next Decade’,Allen Scott,5/27/2015 19:56,472,0,"Cointelegraph spoke with Mark A. Calabria, the Director of Financial Regulation Studies at Cato Institute, about the institute’s views on Bitcoin and the impact of burdensome regulations on cryptocurrencies and the U.S. economy as a whole.“I don’t think the Bitcoin community should be complacent about the current regulatory environment. The potential to get a lot worse is definitely there.”— Mark A. Calabria, Cato InstituteCointelegraph: What do you think about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology?Mark A. Calabria: While I’m an economist, not a tech guy, I’m very excited about Bitcoin, as I am about alternative currencies in general, and perhaps even more interested in the blockchain. Whether Bitcoin succeeds or not, the decentralized ledger offers tremendous potential in a number of areas, from land title to electronic payments. I am optimistic that both Bitcoin and the blockchain technology offer avenues to disrupting our current financial system, which I believe is badly needed.CT: Many would argue that the mission of Cato Institute is almost identical to that of many Bitcoin advocates. What is Cato’s position on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?MC: Well Cato itself does not take positions, its scholars do. But that said, pretty much everyone at Cato, to varying degrees, is supportive of Bitcoin. A number of Cato staff own Bitcoin, as well as a few other alt-currencies. Sure there’s some skepticism about whether Bitcoin is “the one” but there’s a strong desire to see it given a chance and a concern that the financial regulators may hamper its further development.CT: What was the reason for the ‘08 crash, in your view? What do you see as the fundamental problem in today’s financial system?  MC: The ‘08 crash was certainly large by any measure, but its causes were not that uncommon as far as crises go. At the risk of oversimplification, we had an asset boom, largely but not exclusively in the property market, driven by loose monetary policy in the U.S. and large global flows of capital into the U.S. As those funds increased demand in an environment of relatively inelastic supply, particularly in housing markets like California, prices shot up. As with any boom, the momentum attracted fraud and resulted in a general reduction in underwriting standards. “I certainly expect another crisis within the next decade or so.” All of this was made especially fragile by government guarantees, both explicit and implicit, that increased leverage and reduced market discipline. While booms occurred across property types, U.S. housing policy resulted in our single family housing market being far more leveraged than other property markets. So while office, retail and apartments boomed to the same degree, they were not as leveraged and not as interconnected to our capital markets as was single family housing. Lots of really bad policy choices over the years, few of which have been reversed, some of which have been made worse. I certainly expect another crisis within the next decade or so. The fundamental problem facing our financial markets today is a lack of market discipline. CT: What do you see as the potential solution?MC: Foremost we need to eliminate the various government guarantees of risk-taking in our financial markets, including deposit insurance, Federal Reserve rescues of too-big-to-fail companies, and guarantees in the mortgage market, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We need to deregulate our land markets, so that housing supply becomes more elastic, reducing the size and frequency of booms and busts. It is not a coincidence that California was ground zero for the crisis, while prices didn’t move much at all in Texas. You only get booms and busts when demand and supply can become disconnected. And last but not least, we need a rational, rules-based monetary policy.“Most members of Congress have little understanding of financial markets or even basic economics. Perhaps even worse, they don’t want to even have that knowledge.”CT: You have a lot of experience working in Washington DC, having served as a senior staff member on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. How was that experience, and is there interest within the government to reform the financial system?MC: Working in the Senate was certainly educational, if not a little disheartening. Most members of Congress have little understanding of financial markets or even basic economics. Perhaps even worse, they don’t want to even have that knowledge. You have a large contingency in the middle that feels the status quo is mostly OK, and sizeable minorities on the left and right that feel the current system is deeply in need of reform.The problem, of course, is that those who feel the system is broken do not necessary agree on how it is broken and what the appropriate remedies are. Hence, the mushy middle continues to set policy. Ultimately one reason I left the Senate was I felt there was not a lot of leadership there. Politicians are understandably risk averse. They are essentially followers. You have to get the public there first, which in a democracy, is a good thing, even if a little frustrating sometimes.“[R]egulators have so far been relatively restrained. That may well change if regulators start to see cryptocurrencies as a real competitive threat to banks.”CT: How much interest in cryptocurrency is there within the government?MC: At this point it is really more a curiosity than anything else, with a few exceptions. Bitcoin has benefited with an association with the tech community — that’ll help insulate it from attacks from the left (with a few exceptions like Paul Krugman). While there’s been some concern expressed by banks, regulators have so far been relatively restrained. That may well change if regulators start to see cryptocurrencies as a real competitive threat to banks. On the right the concerns have mostly been about terror finance and money laundering, but since neocons have far less influence than they used to, these concerns have largely been checked. All of the proceeding can change and hence it is important for the Bitcoin community to engage and educate policymakers. I wished we lived in a world where that didn’t matter, but we don’t.CT: Are you working with any Bitcoin organizations in DC (e.g., the Digital Chamber of Commerce)?MC: Cato tends to have a, not surprisingly, “go it alone” culture.  So we do occasionally interact and work with Bitcoin organizations but I’d say we aren’t as deeply involved as some of them and we do not, yet, have any staff committed to these issues exclusively. That said, we did launch in the fall our Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and plan to become far more engaged with policy issues surrounding cryptocurrencies. CT: What’s your take on the IRS’s classification of bitcoin as a taxable commodity?MC: I’m not a fan of it. It’s obviously not a commodity in the strictest sense. There is an argument for subjecting it to capital gains taxes, in the same manner you’d apply to a stock or bond, but I do worry that the IRS’s decision will complicate and slow acceptance. If its value relative to the dollar stabilizes, this becomes less of an issue. Of course if lots of users start to use any capital losses to offset other income, I wouldn’t be surprised if the IRS reconsiders. I hope with a future administration this gets reversed.“I should be clear that even under our expansive securities laws: I don’t see Bitcoin as a security. I’m far more worried about what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau might do.”CT: What about the SEC’s position?MC: Not as bad as I’d normally expect, but then the SEC is deeply divided at the commissioner level, and Chair Mary Jo White has been more restrained that I might have initially feared. You don’t quite have as much curiosity among SEC commissioners as you do with, say, CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen. I should be clear that even under our expansive securities laws: I don’t see Bitcoin as a security. I’m far more worried about what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau might do.CT: Do you think the government is following a planned strategy here, or are they scratching their heads with regards to this disruptive tech?MC: It’s more a head scratching. There’s no coordinated DC approach to Bitcoin. Some of that is a result of the fact that regulators still have their hands full with Dodd-Frank. Some of it has arisen from a lack of pressure from Congress. There’s also been little public demand, so far, to “do something” about Bitcoin. So far, it has really been driven by distinct individuals in key policy roles.There’s still a lot of opportunity, and need, to educate policymakers. Those individuals will move on at some point. There’s no guarantee that future appointees will not be hostile. I don’t think the Bitcoin community should be complacent about the current regulatory environment. The potential to get a lot worse is definitely there.CT: What do you think about regulating Bitcoin? Should or can it be regulated, under the NY BitLicense, for example?MC: Setting aside any practical politics, as an economic matter, I’d prefer we not regulate Bitcoin at all. My experience has been that regulation generally just creates barriers to entry and protects established incumbents. That said, private exchanges should adopt rules that protect users. We do not know ex-ante what the right set of rules are going to be, so I think it's critical we have some room here for experimentation. Does that mean some people will lose some money? Absolutely. But then Bitcoin isn’t for the faint hearted, at least not yet. CT: You studied how policy changes in Washington affect low- and moderate-income households. What kind of impact have recent policies had on these households, compared to the higher classes? Do you think cryptocurrency has the potential to democratize money and offer a more egalitarian financial system for the public? MC: The post-crisis financial reforms have unfortunately raised the costs of credit to lower income families, while also reducing its availability. If these reforms resulted in a more stable economy, then that might be a tradeoff worth making, but unfortunately they do not. And of course the post-crisis monetary policy we’ve had has largely benefited higher income families, as easy money has driven up the stock and property markets. Regulatory changes, for instance, have done tremendous harm to the flow of remittances, which for many emerging economies are a crucial source of capital and income. “Misguided and harmful regulations almost always weigh heaviest on the poor, as they are least able to avoid them.”Cryptocurrencies already helped there, but have considerable potential to do more. The same is true for other types of payments. Of course, like most technologies, the first movers have been and will be the non-poor. That’s best, since these first-movers are able to shoulder any losses. But as we build to greater scale and separate out the good from the bad, there can be a tremendous benefit for moderate and low income families. It’s especially for that reason that we need to be cautious on the regulatory front. Misguided and harmful regulations almost always weigh heaviest on the poor, as they are least able to avoid them. The rich can always move to Monaco, or transfer their dollars into Swiss Franc.Technology can be a great disrupter of the establishment, toppling entrenched incumbents. Accordingly I hope we allow cryptocurrencies considerable room to develop.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Blockchain News    #Cryptocurrencies    #Economy    #Financial Systems    #US Government  
"Illinois Considers Regulation for Digital Currencies, Likely To Be Treated As Speculative Assets",Olusegun Ogundeji,12/17/2016 13:40,451,283,"While several proposals are currently at play at the state level in the US, the state of Illinois has begun accepting comments from the public with regards to its published guidance aimed at establishing the regulatory treatment of digital currencies as it currently exists under the state’s Transmitters of Money Act - or TOMA.Comments will be accepted until January 18, 2017, according to the release for comments by the state’s Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.The Department proposed the “Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance” on decentralized digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Zcash announced by Secretary Bryan A. Schneider.Schneider says:“We plan to study digital currencies carefully as the technology develops, however, at this point in time digital currencies like Bitcoin, given their low transaction volume and relatively niche use, are best viewed as a speculative investment or possibly even a new type of asset class, not as money.”It is focused on money transmission activities involving decentralized digital currencies - those not created or issued by a particular person or entity, have no administrator, and have no central repository.The guidance also seeks to determine whether or not an Illinois money transmitter license is required for an entity to engage in the transmission of decentralized digital currencies as this turns on the question of whether a decentralized digital currency is considered ""money"" as defined in TOMA.In section 5 of TOMA, money is defined as a medium of exchange that is authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government as a part of its currency and that is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance.However, despite the definition, the guidance notes that decentralized digital currencies are a representation of value that can function as a medium of exchange but they are not considered as “money” for the purposes of TOMA because they have not been “authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.”“As innovative payment technologies grow in popularity, it is vital that we provide a succinct regulatory framework that gives businesses operating in this space necessary clarity,” says Schneider.Aside from California’s AB 1326 bill, which has a very well tailored definition of virtual currency businesses, New York has its digital currency-specific state regulation, the BitLicense. According to Coin Centre, New Jersey’s and North Carolina’s bills are promising, while Connecticut’s is very troubling.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Altcoin News    #Bitcoin News    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies  
"China Bans VPNs, Cross-Border Gateways That Bypass Existing Blocks",William Suberg,1/23/2017 12:20,443,324,"Amid uncertainty regarding cryptocurrency trading, China has announced a formal ban on the unapproved use of virtual private networks hereinafter VPNs within its borders.Local news outlet Leiphone cites the country’s Ministry of Industry announcing that “without the approval of the telecommunications authorities, gateways including virtual private network VPN and other channels shall not be self-established or leased to carry out cross-border business activities.”VPNs have been a method of bypassing China’s existing blocks on multiple social networking and foreign news sites.The Ministry stated:“In recent years, with the rapid development of network information technology, cloud computing and large data applications, China's Internet access service market is facing a rare opportunity for development, but signs of disorder will also appear and there is an urgent need for regulatory norms.”Clamping down specifically on “business activities” could well have an impact beyond the telecommunications sphere. Specifically, strengthening the law could also be a long-awaited response to capital outflow, which is suspected to be undermining economic progress.The Ministry continued:“The international private gateway leased by a telecommunications enterprise to the user shall be used exclusively for internal use only by the user, and shall not be used to connect to a data center or business platform inside and outside China to carry out telecommunication business operation activities.”There have been mixed reactions to rumors that Bitcoin is being used as a means of moving capital out of China. While mainstream media quote Chinese nationals who allegedly use it successfully, others say it is not happening. Bitquant CEO Joseph Wang, for example, has stated that Bitcoin is “useless” as a means of siphoning funds out of China.The situation with the country’s crypto exchanges meanwhile remains tense.

Why the Bitcoin Community and Governments Should Bury the Hatchet,Iyke Aru,12/7/2016 17:45,440,293,"For the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, the important players are users within the community. However, collaboration with the government is important as well.The potential users of Bitcoin who have the most to gain are people in countries whose financial institutions are broken or corrupt and whose currencies are extremely volatile. This includes almost all of Latin America, Africa, Asia, Eastern European countries such as Ukraine, Russia and Greece.Despite increased awareness about the cryptocurrency in 2016, there is a lot of ground to cover when it comes to the formal adoption and recognition of Bitcoin.Jonathan Chester, the president of Bitwage, believes that with regards to Bitcoin adoption, the power ultimately lies with the people and not the government. Chester believes that relying on the government to achieve adoption may be like waiting for a train that may never show up at the station.He says:“The government is never going to legitimize a technology that challenges its own authority on printing money without the will of the people.”  Chester tells Cointelegraph that in the beginning of 2011, Bitcoin’s market cap was just over $1.5 mln. The majority of users were technologists and cypherpunks. If Bitcoin was on the government’s radar it was only conceptual. As evidenced by FinCEN’s ruling on the virtual currency in 2014 and further upheld by IRS guidance, Chester notes that it was not until 2013 that the government started to take action, when Bitcoin’s price peaked at almost $250 and again at over $1000 per Bitcoin.Chester says that these prices represent signals to the government that Bitcoin is gaining support. As a response to the growth of Bitcoin, the government needs to respond similarly as previously seen with the rise of interest around private Blockchains within financial institutions.“All of this is to say that we need to focus on people in order to grow technology. Bitcoin adoption is very much an educational process,” Chester notes. “The fundamental aspect that people need to understand are the use cases and how secure Bitcoin is.”Chester emphasizes that while in western countries the main values are as an investment or an international payment rail, in the majority of other countries Bitcoin acts as a strong mechanism of value storage and as a domestic payment rail. Once education on the use cases is provided, the next step is educating the users on security.  The Bitwage executive identifies crypto education as the number one concern that his company faces when trying to convince companies and workers to save time and money with a Bitcoin-powered international wage service.  “Even though we don’t require the sending party to sign up, when we speak with BPOs in Brazil, India or the Philippines, they always ask why are you able to get rates that are so much better than traditional mechanisms?” says Chester. “When they hear the answer that leveraging Bitcoin as the underlying rails and their lack of understanding of how secure Bitcoin is as a technology either lengthens the sales process or loses the new potential user altogether.”“This is likely what happens with anyone thinking about taking their first steps into Bitcoin, whether it is using it as a store of value or a payment mechanism and why it is so important to educate on these two subjects,” he adds.However, Chester agrees that it is important to work with the government and emphasizes that the Bitcoin community wants to collaborate and operate in good faith. In doing so, the government should be willing to have an open dialogue with the industry when it comes to regulation and enforcement, thus leading to much fairer regulation.  According to Chester, recent developments in California around Bitcoin regulation serve as a prime example of how an industry and government can work together to create a fair and just regulation by scrapping a recently written bill that would have created an unfair burden and stifled innovation within the industry.  He concludes by saying that the true test will be the outcome of the recent IRS enforcement. The IRS enforcement comes as a surprise seeing as Coinbase and all of the high-profile U.S. companies have been working hard to ensure that the parties are working in good faith with the government. As Coinbase mentioned, they are looking into opposing the bill. Currently, there is an industry-wide effort to support Coinbase in their opposition.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Community    #Government    #Jonathan Chester    #Education    #Coinbase  
New York Releases 31-Page BitLicense Application Form,Tom Jackson,6/26/2015 15:36,437,0,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released the application forms that Bitcoin companies in the state must complete by August 8 in order to register their businesses.The BitLicense was formally adopted earlier this week through publication in the New York State Register. All Bitcoin firms must now complete the 31-page application form and pay a non-refundable US$5,000 application fee in order to continue operating.Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of Kraken, said heavy compliance costs on digital currency exchanges made it more difficult to operate profitable exchanges. He continued:“Many fear it will stifle innovation in the industry and exclude New York from the developing currency.”The final revisions to the New York State regulatory program on digital currencies were released earlier this month by the superintendent of financial services for the NYDFS Ben Lawsky, with minor updates to improve functionality and make state regulators’ roles more clear.Following its official adoption, the application form was released yesterday for Bitcoin companies to fill out. Aside from basic company information, it asks applicants to list all jurisdictions where they have licenses, or have applied for them, as well as indicate whether they have ever been the subject of regulatory or enforcement action in any jurisdiction.Companies must provide copies of all insurance policies, as well as biographical information on all company directors and stockholders. They must also provide an organization chart of the company’s management structure, along with “an explanation of the methodology used to calculate the value of virtual currency in fiat currency.”Applicants must also provide an investigative background report prepared by an independent investigatory agency for each individual applicant, including information such as credit history, employment history, and motor vehicle ownership history. Three personal references from non-relatives are required for all applicants.The BitLicense has prove controversial, with Eobot last week becoming the third firm to exit the state as a result of the new regulations. Though Lawsky has said regulators “need to realize their own limitations; recognize what they do not know, and keep an open mind when approaching new technologies,” many have criticized the scope of the regulations.Users on Reddit reacted sarcastically to the length of the application form, with cointastical saying:“Thank you, Mr. Lawsky, for regulating this industry!!!

US First Cyber Security Regulation to Pressure Bitcoin Companies,Joseph Young,9/15/2016 18:15,437,331,"Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York Department of Financial Services have officially announced the proposal of the country’s first cyber security regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions. If approved and activated, it will affect any financial license holders in the state, including BitLicense-approved Bitcoin companies.Once the 45-day notice and public comment period passes and the proposal is issued, any regulated financial entities, including Bitcoin companies, will be required by law to:“Establish a cybersecurity program; adopt a written cybersecurity policy; designate a Chief Information Security Officer responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing its new program and policy; and have policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of information systems and non-public information accessible to, or held by, third-parties, along with a variety of other requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems.”Bitcoin companies, including exchanges and wallet service providers, are already overwhelmed by having to obtain the expensive BitLicense required by the NYDFS in order to continue their operations in the state of New York.If the new cybersecurity regulation is approved, Bitcoin companies will have to deal with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees to comply with all the requirements stated in the proposal. That includes hiring a Chief Information Security Officer and implementing various government-designed financial security programs and frameworks.Under the BitLicense, Bitcoin companies are demanded to offer any type of personal and sensitive data to the law enforcement for strict KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations. The presence of the new cybersecurity regulation will force Bitcoin companies to store more sensitive user data in their private servers and databases, making their entire platform, software, system, or application more vulnerable.More importantly, the US government has proven to have a poor track record in dealing with confidential data. Yet, the NYDFS Superintendent Maria Vullo says:“Consumers must be confident that their sensitive non-public information is being protected and handled appropriately by the financial institutions that they are doing business with.”It is still too early to speculate whether the proposal will pass the approval period. However, even if proposals from the NYDFS inevitably become intensely controversial, the government will approve the proposals regardless, as seen in the issuance of BitLicense.As more regulations and unjustified financial frameworks become released in the state of New York, Bitcoin companies will be pressured to deal with a unideal ecosystem for various core operations.",2,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Security    #Cybercrime    #Startups    #Andrew Cuomo  
Caribbean’s First Bitcoin Exchange CEO: ‘Our Biggest Difficulty Is an Uninformed Government’,Allen Scott,4/27/2015 13:39,432,0,"Bitt, the Caribbean's first bitcoin exchange company, is looking to tap the region’s potential for remittances and banking services by providing faster and cheaper payments using bitcoin. Cointelegraph spoke to the CEO and co-founder of Bitt, Gabriel Abed, about Bitt’s plans, as well as the challenges and specificities associated with the Caribbean market.“There is huge potential for Bitcoin and blockchain based transactions in the Caribbean.—Gabriel Abed, Bitt CEOAfter a two-year development period, the company launched its BTC solution suite on March 30. It includes a mobile digital wallet, international remittances services and e-commerce merchant solutions.Bitt, which currently runs under beta, is vying for market share of traditional money transmitters and payment solutions services. They want to enable anyone around the world to start accepting bitcoin, with special focus on locals in the Caribbean region, an estimated 60% of which are currently unbanked or under-banked.Cointelegraph: Why did you decide to launch the Bitt exchange for the Caribbean, and how much potential does this region hold for Bitcoin in general?Gabriel Abed: There is huge potential for Bitcoin and blockchain based transactions in the Caribbean.The costs of remittance are astronomic and can exceed 10%, so this is a key area where large savings can be passed onto to end users by using Bitcoin as a vehicle of value transfer and accounting. In order to offer remittance services, however, an exchange with market liquidity is needed. Recognizing this and the lack of any serving Caribbean currencies, we saw a need to be met and an opportunity to seize.The Bitt Exchange is built to accommodate high frequency trading and the demands of Wall Street institutional traders using our APIs. At the same time, we recognize the importance of having an easy-to-use platform for less sophisticated traders, as adoption is a key component of Bitt's MO.CT: With 60% of Caribbeans under banked, how much opportunity is there for ‘remittances’ in terms of savings for users, compared to conventional methods such as  Western Union?GA: The opportunities are endless. The problem is that legacy systems such as Western Union and Money Gram are too slow and costly. Bitt fixes those two problems and adds an extra layer of security with low-friction payment mechanisms.  Our solutions are faster and cheaper.CT: You just closed a seed round of US$1.5 million. Will you be hosting future rounds and what will these funds go towards? GA: Simply put, the money will be used towards building the next generation of financial tools in the Caribbean and helping ignite the Caribbean's first ever, e-commerce and digital boom on behalf of a population in search of options. We are going for future rounds, but will aim to achieve the right partners to take forward with us as we revolutionize digital transactions in this part of the world.“We believe the advantages [of Bitcoin] outweigh the disadvantages of adoption and expect to see greater legal clarity, similar to that of the U.S.”CT: The recent meeting of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) looked at cryptocurrencies promising future clarification. How conducive would you say the regulatory environment for Bitcoin startups is in the Caribbean, and is there a favorable outlook?GA: Having forums like ECLAC that address digital currencies and the risks and opportunities they represent through educational forums is certainly a cause for optimism, as it shows that there is an understanding of the importance of being proactive and not reactive to a technology as important as the blockchain in the Caribbean. We believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of adoption and expect to see greater legal clarity, similar to that of the U.S. and leading Western European countries in the future.CT: Some Caribbean jurisdictions are especially renowned as tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands. How will this play into Bitt’s overall business strategy as well as regulatory stance?GA: It's well-known that low taxes are used as an incentive to attract offshore business to the shores of many islands. Bitt takes advantage of these efficiencies, but they have no bearing on our regulatory stance, which is simple: if the legislation exists, we will follow it.“Our biggest difficulty is an uninformed government unit who may take a negative stance based on limited research and FUD.”CT: Are there any islands in particular that are either hostile or favorable toward cryptocurrencies, and where do you see the biggest potential or difficulty?GA: So far, no hostility, but we have found favorable grounds in some territories. I am not prepared to say anything further as the conversations are in their early stages.Our biggest potential is in the territories with governments who have a history on forward-thinking implementations of next-generation architecture. Our biggest difficulty is an uninformed government unit who may take a negative stance based on limited research and FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt).CT: Given the recent hacks at other exchanges such as Bitstamp and BTER, and Bitcoin’s security concerns in general, how do you ensure that your customer’s funds are safe?GA: Eric Lombrozo, Michael Perklin, Luke Dash Jr., Oliver Gale and Gabriel Abed designed a pretty comprehensive security policy that ensures customers are looked after, and the incidents mentioned above can never apply to Bitt. For starters, we use HSMs [hardware security modules] to generate keys in an offline environment using true-RNG [random number generation] and HD multisignature wallets with independent hot and cold wallet systems in place with redundant transaction signing servers.Our security is one of the leading solutions in the industry. The difference is that Bitt.com has a network security engineer as the CEO (me), and therefore data security and mathematical security is my focus. We could have launched over one year ago, but choose to take our time to address every concern and possible attack vector. “The Caribbean is a special place and you need to be well aware on how to approach officials with something as radical and different as Bitcoin.”CT: The “Let the Bit Drop” Bitcoin Festival that was scheduled to be held on the island of Dominica on March 12 was cancelled due to a lack of “logistical support” from the small Caribbean nation. What do you think they mean by logistical support, and will we ever see such a unique experiment take place in the Caribbean?GA: Lack of research into Caribbean markets and attempts to work with non-governmental officials on a project that required government oversight appeared to have been the issue. The model was quite intriguing and could have been very successful.  However, foreign companies think doing business in the Caribbean is the same as their part of the world.The Caribbean is a special place and you need to be well aware on how to approach officials with something as radical and different as Bitcoin. Discussions and education must come first, followed by a proposed business model, before an announcement or declaration is made. As we have seen in the case of Let the Bit Drop, premature announcements that are pinned on a government's approval are a headache waiting to happen. You need to appreciate this market and how business works in this part of the world that we are pleased to call “home.”Did you enjoy this article?

Australian Regulator Blocks IPO Bitcoin Mining Company,Aaron van Wirdum,7/25/2015 10:23,425,0,"By issuing a stop order, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has further stalled the initial public offering (IPO) requested by Bitcoin mining company Bitcoin Group Limited (BGL, or simply: Bitcoin Group). The reason for this stop order is as of yet not known.A stop order is an administrative mechanism that allows ASIC to prevent offers being made under a disclosure document, which is presented to prospective buyers of Bitcoin Group shares. Such a measure can be taken when ASIC believes the IPO contains a misleading statement, requires additional information, or if a new circumstance has come up since the disclosure document was lodged. It is unclear why Bitcoin Group was issued a stop order.A hearing will be held within 21 days to allow Bitcoin Group to put its views to an independent delegate. After the hearing, ASIC may lift the interim stop order, or place a final stop order preventing the IPO from happening.Bitcoin Group is a Bitcoin mining operator based in Melbourne, with close ties to the Chinese mining industry. The company claims to currently produce some 1.45% of global mining output by operating 5.3 petahashes of mining hardware in seven mining sites across China, as well as Iceland and Australia.Bitcoin Group CEO Samuel Lee had announced that his company lodged its IPO Prospectus to ASIC on the June 29. According to Proactive Investors Australia, Bitcoin Group was expecting to raise AU$20 million (US$15m) through their IPO. Of this AU$20 million, the company was planning to invest AU$18 million of the funds raised into Bitcoin mining hardware and facilities, with another AU$2 million to cover general corporate purposes.Several key investors had already committed to remain as shareholders of Bitcoin Group for at least 12 months from the listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). These include Harry Wang, Managing Director of Australia's third largest money remittance company ANYING, Victor Huang, Managing Director of media agency OzYu Entertainment & Investment as well as OzStudy Group, and Richard Gu, Managing Director of investment company AXF Group.It is not the first time BGL has faced scrutiny from ASIC. In February of this year, the bitcoin company posted information about its proposed IPO on Chinese social media platform WeChat. ASIC subsequently ordered Bitcoin Group to not make any public statements concerning its proposed IPO until after BGL lodged the prospectus.Cointelegraph reached out to ASIC and Bitcoin Group, but has received no response at time of publication.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Bitcoin Mining  
An International Group of Lawyers & Academics Publishes Book on Bitcoin Law,Aaron van Wirdum,7/16/2015 15:46,413,0,"A group of 10 lawyers and academics from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany has published a book on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency law in all four of these jurisdictions. Titled “The Law of Bitcoin,” the book aims to be the definitive guide to navigating international Bitcoin-related law.The book is edited by Stuart Hoegner, a lawyer and accountant in the cryptocurrency and internet gaming spaces, and member of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. Hoegner – who coauthored the Canadian chapter of the book – hopes to get well-researched information into the hands of policy makers, practitioners and entrepreneurs. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Hoegner said:“The book is intended for two broad groups of people: those with little understanding of the law of cryptocurrencies who want to learn more, and those who want in-depth information about more advanced or nuanced concepts in the field. We hope that the content is appropriate for beginners and experts in the sector.”The Law of Bitcoin addresses a wide variety of legal topics in regard to Bitcoin, including criminal law, taxation, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing regulations, financial regulation and more. And while it is not the first book that delves into the legal aspects of Bitcoin, Hoegner believes that the Law of Bitcoin offers a unique perspective in the field. He said:“The book differs from anything that has come before in that we offer up detailed legal analysis about public and private law issues in four different international jurisdictions. There are great law review articles on individual jurisdictions and cryptocurrency areas, and there are books that deal with the law of cryptocurrency as one of several broad topics, but we believe this is the first truly international text that goes into substantial detail about cryptocurrency law.”Apart from Hoegner, the other contributors to the Law of Bitcoin book include the executive director of Coin Center, Jerry Brito; financial services lawyer Paul Anning, tax consultant Mark Brailsford, intellectual property expert Lorna Brazell, Bitcoin regulation specialist Matthew Cleary, financial services lawyer Jillian Friedman, legal expert Michael Taylor, attorney Ryan Straus, and lawyer and DogeRain CEO Christoph-Nikolaus von Unruh.The Law on Bitcoin is published by iUniverse through a new imprint, Crypto Press, which specializes in cryptocurrency-related books.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Lifestyle    #Coin Center    #Books  
Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Exits Hawaii Citing “Impractical” Legislation Changes,William Suberg,2/28/2017 9:57,412,154,"Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange and wallet provider Coinbase has announced it is quitting Hawaii after new legislation would make operating there “impractical.”The Aloha State, which previously signaled it wanted to construct “educated” Blockchain legislation, now requires operators to hold fiat reserves at least equal to the amount held as virtual currency.This stipulation runs in addition to businesses handling virtual currency to obtain a license. While Coinbase says it has “no objection to” this procedure, maintaining a “redundant” fiat reserve would be “impractical, costly and inefficient.”“The Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) has communicated regulatory policies which we believe will render continued Coinbase operations there impractical,” the company wrote in a blog post.Customers are now asked to withdraw all funds from their wallets and close their accounts.The move by legislators is unusual in coming just days after the State approved the creation of a working group to study how Blockchain technology could benefit the local economy.Representatives voted for House Bill 1481 to be passed unamended.“...[T]he purpose of this Act is to establish a working group consisting of representation from the public and private sectors to examine, educate, and promote best practices for enabling Blockchain technology to benefit local industries, residents, and the State of Hawaii,” an extract from the Bill’s text reads.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Coinbase    #Hawaii  
Deep State Uses Encryption to Subvert Trump Administration,Joël Valenzuela,2/23/2017 9:30,411,184,"The Trump administration has faced a series of embarrassing leaks from rogue officials encrypting their communications, leading allies in Congress to call for a crackdown on encryption in government.Encrypting may be a weapon of Deep State, the term coined by the media to refer to a state within a state. Some experts suspect that it exerts control over public policy regardless of which political party is currently in power. Its members from intelligence and high bureaucracy guide policy in their own interests through leaking or other means of internal dissent.During the opening weeks of the Trump administration, a stream of leaks appeared as to various activities by the president and administration officials. It ranged from relatively innocuous personal habits to serious infractions, including former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s unauthorized communications with Russia.Multiple reports have surfaced that White House staffers are using Confide, an end-to-end encrypted messaging app, in order to cover their tracks when leaking information to the press.Since its beginning, the Trump administration has dealt with friction within the government itself. In the early days of the administration, it ordered a media blackout for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in order to reevaluate its official position on climate change. This led to the rise of rogue social media accounts run by EPA employees in defiance of the gag order to continue to disseminate information, some of which were later shut down.To deal with this division of priorities in the federal government, federal employees have reportedly turned to encryption to communicate amongst themselves to discuss strategies for resisting White House edicts. In response to this attempt to obfuscate federal employees’ communications, Republicans in Congress have demanded details into the use of encryption by federal workers.As the internal struggle within the US government continues over control of agency employee communications, the greater global issue of a government crackdown on encryption threatens to become an increasing issue this year.US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has maintained a stance siding with law enforcement on data access matters, coming out against end-to-end encryption and in favor of backdoor access to encrypted apps for law enforcement agencies. Following his initial pick by the Trump administration, downloads for Edward Snowden-endorsed encrypted messaging app Signal saw a rapid increase.In Europe, the war on encryption is already much further along. The UK passed a law late last year, the Investigatory Powers Bill, which legalized mass surveillance on its citizens. A provision in this bill also effectively banned end-to-end encryption by mandating that telecommunications operators “remove electronic protection” when asked to do so by authorities. Germany and France are pushing for the EU to restrict the use of end-to-end encryption, and the German Federal Intelligence Service has already obtained funding to develop technology capable of cracking encryption used by apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp, signaling that a full war against encryption may not be far off.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Encryption    #Donald Trump    #Government    #USA  
Deloitte to Work with Australian Bitcoin Lobby on ‘Regulatory Changes’,William Suberg,7/20/2015 16:04,403,0,"Deloitte has announced its partnership with the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) to “work on the strategic, tax and regulatory changes that will need to happen” in Australia.The world’s fourth-largest accountancy firm will form a working group with ADCCA members, tasked, iTnews reports via Silicon Angle. The focus of the group is due to comprise “creating accounting practices” for businesses dealing with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Speaking about the news, Deloitte Australia partner Jonathan Perkinson underlined the firm’s long standing interest in the Australian digital payments space.“Deloitte has had an interest in digital currencies for quite some time, so this was a great opportunity to get involved. Digital currencies have a lot of momentum at the moment,” he said. “With ADCCA, we’ll be working on the strategic, tax and regulatory changes that will need to happen, and we’ll be recommending and challenging specific changes in those arenas.”Perkinson made specific reference to the situation regarding taxation of cryptocurrency transactions, which have made it compulsory for entities registered for Australia’s general sales tax (GST) to pay a 10% fee on any trading in bitcoin. Regulatory reshuffles have so far not altered governmental perspective on the practice, which Perkinson hinted at as a barrier to Bitcoin’s future success in the country. He emphasized:“The challenge is to get cryptocurrencies taxed in an appropriate way.”Perkinson’s words echoed those of fellow Deloitte Partner Ivan Zasarsky at the Global Digital Currency Convention in Brisbane last November. In a presentation on the feasibility of blockchain and Bitcoin technology for use within Australian finance, Zasarsky urged regulators to “go slow.” Citing the example of US legislator practice regarding prepaid debit cards, “just making a kneejerk reaction could cause more harm than good,” in the case of digital currency in Australia.“It’s very difficult to put together a regime of laws,” he added. “They’re complex, and any change that takes away can also cause other ramifications and loopholes or openings accordingly.”Deloitte has been making noises internationally on the issue of blockchain technology in its own business practices. In an interview with CoinDesk earlier this month, Deloitte Consulting principal Eric Piscini said that as a company, Deloitte “needs to understand more about the blockchain and the underlying technology.”“We believe it can really change the way our clients operate and how we operate,” he added.The Australian inititiate in the meantime is still very much in its infancy, Deloitte Australia Director Taralyn Elliot said.“We haven’t started working on developing accounting standards yet. They’re in a fledgling state at the moment.

India Prints New 1000 Rupee Note 3 Months After Banning it,William Suberg,2/21/2017 13:48,397,232,"India is set to reintroduce its outlawed 1000 rupee note, just three months after the government withdrew it as part of currency reforms.As local news resource, Indian Express reports, production of the new incarnation of the note has already started, although it is as yet unclear when it will enter circulation.Production would have started in January, a senior government official told the paper, but “has been delayed due to the pressing need to supply Rs 500 notes.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to suddenly withdraw higher-denomination rupee notes Nov. 8 sent shockwaves through India’s largely cash-based economy.Huge queues at banks became a common sight as users fought to find alternative ways of payment, which soon included buying and trading Bitcoin as a backup option.Following the move, India became a highly active purchasing market, making number two on Purse.io’s Bitcoin discount marketplace listings.Limits on savings withdrawals were also instigated, with Feb. 20 marking a deadline for the limit to be raised to 50,000 rupees ($746) per week.Earlier this month, India’s central bank issued a public warning against the use of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India

Senate Committee Discussed Bitcoin Benefits,Nina Lyon,11/20/2013 15:10,394,0,"During the hearing of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs most of the experts explained that bitcoin payment network offers real benefits to the modern financial system, despite the fact that a new form of digital currency may be used as money laundering and other illegal activities instrument.The reports of the United States Department of Homeland Security, provided for the hearing of the US Senate Committee on this Monday has a wide range of positive opinions. They concluded that digital currency is a legitimate financial instrument, and its widespread use has significant benefits for consumers. Opinion of state agencies considerably increases the chances of official recognition by the authorities of digital currency. According to their written agency representatives reports published this week – digital money offer real benefits and carry some risks as any other payment system.Hearing of the Senate Committee main reason was to explore the potential opportunities and risks of the virtual currency, including the fact of recent close of the website Silk Road in October. Closure of the black market, where people could buy drugs, fake documents and other illegal goods for bitcoins, gave reason to believe that Bitcoin is becoming more widely recognized currency for not only for legitimate business.During the hearing in the Dirksen Senate Office Building most of the discussions were focused on the risks around digital currency. Senators were interested in understanding the ways how to regulate bitcoin and minimize all risks concerning digital currency.Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and director of its Technology Policy Program was also on hearing. He mentioned that: two years ago, everyone was scared when the Silk Road first appeared on the scene but since then, Congress has examined the issue better and now realizes that bitcoin has large potential. Unfortunately, as with any other new technology, this one also has some problems. It is important to keep a balance, and tend to look favorably on this technology.Bitcoin is especially attractive currency for people who want to protect their identity as it gives ability to make anonymous transaction. Immediately after closing the Silk Road, bitcoin prices fell but soon after it have recovered and continue to rise for new record levels.Committee is aware that digital currency has reached a price record of $500 this week, which mean that it has grown more than x30 times during this year.Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has responded to the request of the Senate, saying that he has no plans to regulate digital currency. ""Despite the fact that the Federal Reserve System as a whole following the developments in the field of virtual currency and other innovative payment systems, we can not directly control or regulate these innovations and the companies that provide them to the market.""However, the anonymity of cyberspace gives opportunities to launder huge money. Agencies believe that it is important to minimize the ease of transactions for criminals.Mythili Raman, Assistant Attorney General, said that because every bitcoin transaction is in the public domain it is possible to trace the movement of money between accounts. It means that they do not give criminals the insurance from hide from the investigation. But it is necessary to develop appropriate techniques.Experts mentioned at the hearing that criminal activity has been a problem in all money transfer systems. In the beginning the same problems were with the credit cards and electronic systems such as PayPal, and that this should not be a reason to restrict innovation. When it comes to regulation bitcoin should be treated just the same as any other financial instrument.Nevertheless, Paul Smocer, the president of BITS, the technology policy division of The Financial Services Roundtable said “I would question if that is applicable across the industry, and whether there are things we can make sure to ensure that the kinds of litigations and controls that he has put in place are applicable to all”.Sarah Jane Hughes, university scholar and fellow in commercial law at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, gave recommendations including not creating a unified state/federal regulation for them, or to give them special regulatory treatment to foster innovation.Gallippi’s BitPay co-founder, CTO Stephen Pair in his testimony said that “It is precisely the lack of clarity around regulations that is causing banks to take a very cautious approach to bitcoin.” He also pointed that “There are many banks that want to make use of the Bitcoin technology but they are unsure how regulators will react.”Actually Gallippi was the only person operating a virtual currency business who could testify at the hearing. “Guidance from the IRS, Department of Treasury, Department of Justice, and SEC has all established that bitcoins are legal, and that those dealing with them must simply follow existing tax laws and anti-money laundering regulations,” he said.Since the amount of bitcoins is strictly limited – the bitcoin protocol allows making only 21 million units – people are concerned about digital currency deficit in future. Today users have bid up the prices of exchanges on the Internet. Especially the rush of buying bitcoins could be seen in China. BTC China has became the world’s number one bitcoin exchange market has a large quantity of coins.Due to the risen interest to bitcoin and its independency from the government, many of bitcoin users were afraid of negative attitude to digital currency in Washington. But experts who represented bitcoin interests at the hearing believe that the cooperation with regulatory authorities is very important step that must be taken in order to support bitcoin further growth.In general there were both positive and skeptical messages from the government agencies at the hearing of the US Senate. Though they have a lot of positive analysis of digital currency it is still unclear what legislative actions they are going to use for digital currency.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #USA  
EU Central Bank: Europe Should Not Promote Digital Currencies Such As Bitcoin,Olusegun Ogundeji,10/22/2016 13:17,393,269,"In a legal opinion recently published by the European Central Bank (ECB), the Union’s apex bank has outlined some of the reasons it thinks the European Union members should not promote the use of digital currencies.Though the ECB recognises that the technological advances relating to the distributed ledger technology underlying alternative means of payment, such as virtual currencies, may have the potential to increase the efficiency, reach and choice of payment and transfer methods, it warned:“...the Union legislative bodies should take care not to appear to promote the use of privately established digital currencies, as such alternative means of payment are neither legally established as currencies, nor do they constitute legal tender issued by central banks and other public authorities.”Some of its other concerns include the higher volatility associated with virtual currencies, which does not always appear to be related to economic or financial factors and the lack of guarantee for holders of virtual currency that they will be able to exchange their units for goods and services or legal currency in the future.The opinion says:“...the reliance of economic actors on virtual currency units, if substantially increased in the future, could in principle affect the central banks’ control over the supply of money with potential risks to price stability, although under current practice this risk is limited. Thus, while it is appropriate for the Union legislative bodies, consistent with the FATF’s recommendations, to regulate virtual currencies from the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing perspectives, they should not seek in this particular context to promote a wider use of virtual currencies.”The ECB’s opinion is in response to the requests made by the Council and the European Parliament on a proposal for a directive amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 which centres on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing.The proposed directive expands on the list of obliged entities to which an EU Directive applies to include providers engaged primarily and professionally in exchange services between ‘virtual currencies’ and ‘fiat currencies’. It also requires Member States to ensure that providers of exchanging services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers are licensed or registered.This is based on several views including that virtual currencies do not qualify as currencies from the Union’s perspective but could be regarded as a means of exchange, rather than as a means of payment and that terrorists and other criminal groups are currently able to transfer money within virtual currency networks by concealing the transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on such exchange platforms.It says the use of virtual currencies also poses greater risks than traditional means of payment in the sense that the transferability of virtual currency relies on the internet and is limited only by the capacity of the particular virtual currency’s underlying network of computers and IT infrastructure. It stresses that the inability to cover virtual currency transactions by any of the control measures provided for in the proposal could provide a means of financing illegal activities.",1,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Central Bank    #Digital Currency    #ECB  
"$33 Trillion Sees China Become World’s Largest Banking System, Surpasses EU",William Suberg,3/22/2017 11:05,391,320,"China’s banking system has officially overtaken the Eurozone to become the world’s largest, figures released this month show.Research data from the Financial Times reveal Chinese bank assets to have been worth $33 trillion at the end of 2016, while Eurozone assets totaled $31 trillion.The usurping of the rest of the developed world in terms of banking prowess may come as little surprise given the sheer speed with which China has expanded its economy. However, commentators suggest the growth, in fact, belies the country’s true economic fragility.Unlike in other developed markets, RT notes, China relies on bank loans to finance growth at a local level. Changing the status quo would impact Beijing’s ability to control the ecosystem.“The massive size of China’s banking system is less a cause for celebration than a sign of an economy overly dependent on bank-financed investment, beset by inefficient resource allocation, and subject to enormous credit risks,” former IMF China Division Head Eswar Prasad told the publication.For comparison, the Financial Times showed US banking assets to be worth $16 trillion.China, meanwhile, appears to be on the cusp of launching a fully-regulated environment for cryptocurrency.

"Fully Regulated, Fully Compliant: Gemini Now Licensed in Washington",Jon Buck,6/14/2017 16:05,20073,352,"As the value of different cryptocurrencies remains volatile, at least one exchange is expanding its influence. Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange, has officially announced its ability to complete transactions in Washington State.The company is a “fully regulated, fully compliant, New York-based digital asset exchange for both individuals and institutions.” With this new change, customers in the state of Washington will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ether with USD.The company is already fully functional as an exchange for cryptocurrencies in 45 states as well as multiple countries overseas. However, because of fiscal requirements, Washington had remained untapped by the company.

IMF Chief Lagarde On ‘Dark Side’ Of Crypto: Blockchain is ‘Exciting’ But Needs Regulations,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/13/2018 20:17,20016,250,"International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Christine Lagarde said that crypto markets must be regulated by the same laws that apply to the traditional markets in an IMF blog post published today, March 13.The post, “Addressing the Dark Side of the Crypto World,” begins by praising the virtues of Blockchain technology, which she refers to as an “exciting advancement that could help revolutionize fields beyond finance.” However, Lagarde adds that regulators must “understand the peril that comes along with the promise.”In terms of specific ways to enact regulations that will protect consumers in the crypto markets, Lagade writes that one must “fight fire with fire.” She brings up two examples: using digital ledger technology (DLT) to “create registries of standard, verified, customer information along with digital signatures,” and using biometrics, artificial intelligence, and cryptography to more quickly find suspicious transactions.As cryptocurrencies are decentralized, anonymous, and have no inherent need for a central bank, Lagarde sees a potential for their use in money laundering and financing terrorism. She mentions the example of darknet marketplace Alphabay, which had more than $1 bln exchanged through crypto on its platform by the time it was shut down in July 2017.Lagarde writes that cryptocurrencies could threaten the stability of traditional financial markets, and that regulations must be developed on a global scale with help from the IMF:“No country can handle this challenge alone [...] Since crypto-assets know no borders, the framework to regulate them must be global as well.”Lagarde’s goal is to give crypto consumers the same protection that they have in traditional markets, and references several agencies which she sees as good exemplars of regulatory diligence; the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which observes fintech innovation, and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which fights money laundering and terrorism financing. The FATF is currently preparing a report on ways to prevent crypto use in money laundering for the upcoming G20 summit.She also mentions the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators internationally beginning to apply securities laws to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).Lagarde’s takeaway is that crypto is “somewhere in between” a fad and a revolution, and that only global cooperation, along with the IMF, can “harness the potential of crypto-assets while ensuring that they never become a haven for illegal activity or a source of financial vulnerability.”Lagarde has previously said that she believes crypto regulation is both inevitable and necessary. However, she has also spoken positively of the potential role for cryptocurrencies to play in countries with weak currencies.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #IMF    #Money Laundering    #Alphabay    #ICO  
"Canadian Financial Regulator Warns Of Potential Scam, Unregistered “Cryptobank” ICO",Helen Partz,3/6/2018 13:20,19894,299,"New Brunswick, Canada’s financial watchdog warned cryptocurrency investors of a potential scam website Bitcoin-bank.io that claims to be a ""cryptobank"" in an investor alert published Monday, March 5.According to the statement, the Financial and Consumer Services Commission (FCNB) started investigating the company profile after Bitcoin-bank.io appeared in ads on a Canadian online classified website. FCNB found that the company is neither registered  for trading in New Brunswick, nor for advising on securities or derivatives, despite the fact that it claims to provide these services in the province.On its website, Bitcoin-bank.io offers “Cryptobanking at its Best” services, such as payment card and cryptocurrency wallet solutions. The website also promote its own ongoing Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with one BTCB coin ‘starting’ at 0.000975 Bitcoin (BTC).In its Whitepaper, the Bitcoin-bank.io team notes that the platform is geared towards newcomers in the cryptocurrency space, and does not require any previous trading skills to use:“It is a perfect platform for those who wants [sic] to have a passive income on daily basis without having to learn the related crypto or trading skills or the time to watch the markets all day long.”FCNB also reported that the company is not registered at the California address listed on its website. Moreover, according to the report, the list of the company employees consists of fake names with attached photographs taken from other websites and copied content.Last month, Canadian securities regulators approved the launch of the country’s first Blockchain-based Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), Harvest Blockchain Technologies Index (HBLK).In December 2017, researchers at the Bank of Canada released a report examining the feasibility of launching a state-issued Blockchain-based digital currency, the “central bank digital currency” (CBDC).",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Canada    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Bitcoin Wallet    #ICO    #Tradings    #ETF  
Russian Central Bank Wants to Treat Bitcoin As Digital Commodity,William Suberg,5/25/2017 15:10,19839,1056,"The Deputy of the Russian Central Bank Olga Skorobogatova has called for virtual currencies to be treated as “digital commodities.”Quoted by Interfax, Skorobogatova said that the central bank would seek to “adopt regulations with a specific focus on tax, controls and accountability like [those which apply to] digital commodities.”“With virtual currency being emitted which is not backed by the gold standard and remains beyond control from the point of view of supply, sooner or later this can lead to instability in financial markets,” she added.Russia is on the way to adopting formal regulations on cryptocurrency from 2018, the central bank previously announced, with proposals for what form these should take due next month.In April, during preliminary comments on the Russian government’s future stance on Bitcoin and other currencies, deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev nonetheless added that the state wished to monitor transactions, regardless of how this could be realistically achieved.“The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain,” he said.“If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.”",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Central Bank    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
BTCC Boss Bobby Lee Wants Bitcoin To Be Regulated,Darryn Pollock,7/12/2017 11:30,19611,454,"The CEO of BTCC, a major Chinese Bitcoin exchange, has said that he hopes the digital currency gets regulated in order to stabilize the monetary system and slow its volatile swings up and down.""I think regulation is much needed for this new asset class because otherwise, it'll run amok from society,"" Lee told CNBC.In the original white paper, Bitcoin boasted of its decentralized nature and how it was a currency that was under no one's thumb, especially not banks and governments. However, as the digital currency has exploded into the mainstream, picking up huge adoption, Lee believes its longevity and further growth rests in being regulated.It is this rapid growth that is causing issues in further expansion believes Lee. Cryptocurrencies, especially those like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have huge market caps and have experienced unprecedented growth could spiral out of control.There are signs already of a system under pressure as Ethereum experienced a flash crash in June where the price bottomed out to 10 cents after sitting around $319. It rebounded, but since then has been down from that initial peak.Bitcoin price has been predicted to reach $11,000 per coin by 2020, by Lee himself, and it is this prediction that makes the exchange boss hope that regulations can come to support, rather than snuff out the innovative and emerging technology.“The challenge is how to craft the rules around this new technology,"" he said at the Rise conference in Hong Kong:""I think it's taking the lawmakers and regulators some time to wrap their minds around it, and to come up with the appropriate rules and laws to govern companies, how we do business, to govern individuals and how people conduct business online.""Indeed, recently different nations have been feeling out how to regulate the currency. Places such as China and Russia started their approach to digital currency with a hardline but have softened somewhat.China halted the withdrawal of fiat currency from exchanges earlier this year for about a month before finally lifting that order and letting the Bitcoin market flow again in the country. But it is the very nature of Bitcoin that is the stumbling block as China is still trying to define what Bitcoin is before regulating it.Other places such as Switzerland have taken a very light approach to regulating digital currencies, lumping them into the protective bubble of fintech companies as they would rather look to entice companies to explore options within their borders.Startups in the Bitcoin business are exempt from many banking regulations in Switzerland as they grow in these ‘sandbox’ environments.",3,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bobby Lee    #BTCC

On the topic of Blockchain, she told forum members that it “is without a doubt necessary to buy into” such “revolutionary technology,” yet understanding the associated risks was essential.Fully-controlled integration would require “ seven to 10 years,” she added and continued: “In the coming years we will be concentrating on digital letters of credit, custodian accounting and digital bank guarantees using the Blockchain.”Gref had also been encouraging on Blockchain, estimating initial implementations by 2019. “Two to two-and-a-half years is the timeframe in which we could be talking about seeing Blockchain technology commercially operating,” he said in February.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Sberbank    #Olga Skorobogatova    #Tradings    #Cryptocurrencies  
US State Department is Looking for Interns for Its New Blockchain Workgroup,Anthony Coggine,6/13/2017 22:28,19528,455,"As part of its new initiative focused on the importance of Blockchain technology, US State Department has started looking for a new intern.The new working group opened by the US State Department is called “Blockchain@State,” and it will be managed by the Office of Global Partnerships. The main goal of the working group initiative is to determine the usefulness of research applications and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in US foreign policy. One of the intern’s job responsibilities is to monitor key developments in Blockchain processes and utilize cases. Aside from that, the intern must prepare weekly reports for the new Blockchain workgroup.The job may also require a host of different skills. A keen eye for research is needed because the intern must delve on a diverse range of Internet sources like tech blogs, forums, online channels, news sites, government pages, and academic research about Blockchain.Extensive data preparation is also required because the intern needs to forward a report to a stakeholder organization. Additionally, the intern must also possess advanced communication skills. The scope of the job is global, so the intern must expect direct collaboration with several stakeholders.With Blockchain becoming more popular these days, a significant number of US government departments are rapidly showing interest. According to Federal News Radio, the General Services Administration is planning to launch a federal Blockchain project sometime around this summer. The project is a major part of GSA’s Emerging Citizen Technology program, which aims to combine the efforts of multiple agencies in brainstorming about AI and other innovative technologies.On December 9, 2016, the Department of Commerce has also hosted a public meeting that’s focused on Blockchain interoperability and the discussion of emerging technologies.

The statement explains that the use of such ATMs may be a crime and businesses should consider this prior to installing them.The warning comes after two ATMs were installed in local shops in the district of Kazan by a 34 year old businessman. The equipment had been leased and moved into the stores, and was offering Bitcoin for Rubles. The warning also includes details on the Russian government’s stance on cryptocurrencies, even linking the purchase with terrorism. According to the statement:“Currently, the legal status of crypto-currency in the Russian Federation is not defined. The provision by Russian legal entities of services for exchanging ""virtual currencies"" for rubles and foreign currency, as well as for goods (work, services) is considered as potential involvement in the implementation of questionable transactions in accordance with the legislation on combating the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime, and the financing of terrorism.”The warning follows a general cooling in Russia regarding cryptocurrencies after Putin and other government officials expressed concern and even threatened bans.

Russian Minister: We Will ‘Never’ Consider Bitcoin Legal,William Suberg,11/20/2017 18:28,24323,713,"The head of Russia’s Ministry of Communications (Minkomsvyaz) has said the country will “never” legalize Bitcoin within its economy.Speaking to journalists on the fringes of the Duma’s first Russian National Youth Forum, Nikolay Nikiforov said that while Bitcoin was to remain outside legality, adoption of Blockchain technology was “entirely possible.”“Bitcoins are a foreign application of Blockchain technology, and Russian law will never consider them as a legal entity under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation,” he declared quoted by Interfax.The comments add further opaqueness to the already confusing stance of Russian lawmakers to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. A host of senior figures have given conflicting views as to how Russia will treat the emerging financial phenomenon, with some saying an outright ban is inevitable.Last week, popular social content sharing network Golos was blocked by regulator Roskomnadzor for seven days over alleged data privacy breaches, which developers are attempting to challenge in court.At the same time, the Kremlin had announced earlier this year it is aiming to corner the Bitcoin mining market, pumping millions of dollars into taking shares away from China. It will also regulate mining by July next year.Blockchain has always fared considerably better in Russia, and the latest noises from Moscow have only served to underline interest in its various uses.For example, ‘self-administering’ laws could soon become commonplace thanks to implementation of smart contracts, local news sources report this week.",49,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia

One of the problems with Bitcoin is the extent to which it is just a gigantic Ponzi scheme,” the Shadow Home Secretary continued her explanation of the risks posed by Bitcoin.“And if everyone took their bitcoin money and tried to buy a new car all at once the whole thing would collapse.”The Labour MP is known in the British public for making controversial and sometimes ill-informed remarks on a range of topics. Abbott once suggested that her party would be able to hire 10,000 people for the UK police at a total cost of £300,000, translating to an average annual salary of £30, or a little over $40, per each new officer.Diane Abbott also tweeted that one of the lessons to be learned from the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire is that “fire puts out water,” and called for the UK government to do something about the drought in the province of Davao del Norte in Indonesia, which is actually located in the Philippines.Abbot is not the only public figure to harshly criticize Bitcoin over the past month. Matthew Lesko, the “free money guy,” who became famous in the 90s by writing books on how to get federal grants from the US government, called Bitcoin a “scam” and a “gamble” in an interview with CNET.Charlie Munger, a 94-year-old business partner of Warren Buffett and the vice president of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, said that the idea of cryptocurrency is “totally asinine” and that it is “disgusting” that people buy Bitcoin.",42,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #UK    #Government

Without clear regulations and the resulting injection of “big money”, a burst of the “crypto bubble” remains unlikely, Newsome told Forbes.Commentators inside and outside the cryptocurrency realm remain at odds over whether crypto assets are or ever were in a price bubble.Newsome commented from his new position as a central advisor to US policy makers on cryptocurrency. This week he was due to deliver a report together with former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Paul Atkins, but the report was postponed, Forbes reports.Regulating crypto assets and business practices remains a central concern for the current chairmen of the two national agencies in 2018.

Reserve Bank of India Hints on Possible Ban on Cryptocurrencies,Lisa Froelings,11/7/2017 18:25,38720,549,"India’s central bank, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has previously announced its plan to ban the use of virtual currencies as a form of payment across the country. The central bank, however, has shown its support to Blockchain, which is the technology behind the cryptocurrencies.At a conference held in Mumbai, India on Nov. 6, 2017, RBI executive director, S Ganesh Kumar, has hinted that the digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum will not be allowed to be legally used across the country.“Our current position on Bitcoins is that we will not be using it for any payments and settlements…though the technology underlying cryptocurrencies will not end.”Despite SBI’s rejection of the cryptocurrencies, the central bank seems to see significant promise in the technology used to power the digital currencies called Blockchain. In his comments, Kumar has stated that the technology showed great potential in the financial sector.As a proof of Blockchain’s great promise, several banks in India such as ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank are already using Blockchain in such applications as overseas transactions and international remittances.The cryptocurrency market in India accounts for just a very small portion of the country’s financial sector. Digital currencies are mainly used as an investment option. The leading virtual currency Bitcoin is accepted as a form of payment at only a few restaurants, and several cryptocurrency exchanges allow users to use the digital currencies as payments for books or movie tickets.However, the possible ban of the digital currencies in India has displeased the players in the country’s virtual currency trade. According to Bitcoin exchange Zebpay cofounder Sandeep Goenka, they will try to educate the government about the cryptocurrencies.“We will do our best to continue with our efforts to educate the government about cryptocurrencies.

"Bitcoin Regulation is Simple in Theory, Incredibly Complex in Reality",Darryn Pollock,11/21/2017 23:30,15755,465,"Regulators have been struggling to come to a consensus, keep in touch and set a working relationship with Cryptocurrencies since they became big enough to worry about. The idea is simple, but implementation is much more difficult due to the quasi-anonymous nature of digital currency.Regulators worldwide have not yet decided on a consistent approach. Some go the direct route, like China, and try and implement bans which are not as effective as they would hope. Others, like Switzerland, embrace the digital coins, hoping to attract more Blockchain builders.Thus there is a large gray area at the moment, with regulators floundering in the middle.Regulating cryptocurrencies should be quite simple, in theory. After all, unlike fiat money which can be transferred without any records, cryptocurrencies leave a digital footprint. That footprint is not as simple to follow as a bank transfer, for example, but it is not impossible.Professor Andrei Kirilenko, director of the Centre of Global Finance and Technology at the Imperial College of London, believes that by their very nature, cryptocurrencies have a reporting system built in, but individuals sometimes obscure their identity in various ways.He believes that if digital currency transactions were regulated in such a way as to compel transparency, cryptocurrency would be no harder to regulate and tract than bank transfers. Of course, it’s unlikely that users would just accept such regulation without protest.Kirilenko adds that the 2008 financial crisis created a perfect environment for the rise of digital currencies. Rapid technological development, in conjunction with a mass talent exodus, the failure of previous systems and the affordability of computing, meant fintech was given the space to flourish.But that flourishing has been so rapid that regulators can’t keep up with the evolving cryptocurrency space. However, there will come a time when regulators keep up, believes Dr Co-Pierre Georg, senior lecturer at AIFMRM and Director of the UCT Financial Innovation Lab.“This means it is only a matter of time before they are so widely used that their regulation will be non-negotiable.”This battle to keep up currently is coupled with the fact that Cryptocurrencies are unprecedented, creating far-reaching complications.There exists a desire in many parts of the world, and by many citizens of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem, to see some form of regulation as it would add legitimacy. However the drive for regulation has been de-prioritised in many areas because the resources required for regulation require justification to taxpayers and there are frequently more pressing problems. As such, cryptocurrencies are often dealt with on a case-by-case basis.There is no leading law, or jurisdiction, or precedent out there that states how to deal with cryptocurrencies; instead, regulators must resort to experimentation. Kirilenko says:“There are multiple aspects to the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Suppose I’m a regulator. What do I regulate? There are different ways to touch that elephant, There are different pieces of regulation. If you are going after one, some or all of them, you have to know what would be your main mandate — whether it is a monetary policy mandate, for instance.”Regulation may seem like a dirty word in the decentralized Bitcoin community, but smart regulation will increase adoption. The fact that only 802 people paid tax on Bitcoin in the US in 2015 has galvanized the IRS, who is now using a company called Chainalysis to try and catch tax cheats. Regulation is inevitable, if for no other reason than tax agencies wanting their cut. Proper regulation and taxation will bring Bitcoin in line with existing monetary systems and spur investment by mainstream finance players.",15,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #China    #Switzerland    #Taxes  
UBS: Crypto is Doomed to Low Demand... Unless You Pay Taxes With It,William Suberg,10/18/2017 16:20,23871,260,"Swiss investment bank UBS says Bitcoin is in a “speculative bubble” and needs government permission not to fail.In a whitepaper published a week ago, UBS, which is at the same time a major proponent of Blockchain technology, said demand for any cryptocurrency hinges on governments accepting it, of all things, for tax payments. The paper reads:""If governments refuse to accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments, the single most important transaction in an economy, that significantly reduces demand for cryptocurrencies. Governments are highly unlikely to ever take this step.""The tone of the bank is somewhat ironic given that its home country of Switzerland does in fact allow residents to pay municipal taxes with Bitcoin.The pioneering move gained considerable media attention when it launched in Chiasso last month.UBS, meanwhile, is a key player in the increasingly prominent Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, having joined on its inauguration in March. The non-profit organization has since gone on to include names such as the largest Russian banking institution, Sberbank.While that organization’s members have varying views on cryptocurrency, UBS appears to remain steadfast in its suspicion.“The relatively high volume of cryptocurrency turnover, against limited real-world use, suggests that many buyers are seeking speculative gain, never intending to use cryptocurrencies to make a real-world transaction. With each of the other characteristics of typical bubbles in evidence, a twenty-fold increase in Bitcoin prices in just two years, and an absence of any fundamental economic backing, cryptocurrency prices are almost certainly a bubble.""",15,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Bitcoin Price    #Cryptocurrencies    #UBS    #Government    #Bubble  
China Imposes New Capital Controls; Bitcoin Price Optimistic,Joseph Young,11/27/2016 11:45,609,446,"China has unveiled new capital control regimes that will restrict and limit overseas investment by Chinese corporations. Similar to China’s crackdown on Wealth Management Products (WMPs) in October, analysts predict that the tightened regulations on overseas investment will increase the demand for Bitcoin.In October, China introduced various regulatory frameworks to control the country’s $13 trillion worth of WMPs. Almost immediately after the announcement from the People’s Bank of China, the price of Bitcoin increased, surging by three percent overnight.This month, the Chinese State Council is set to impose tighter controls and policies on overseas investment in an attempt to strengthen its economy and prevent capitals of local companies leaving the country.The Wall Street Journal reviewed various documents submitted by the State Council and reported that a wide range of regulatory frameworks are planned to be passed by the State Council and the Chinese government in the upcoming weeks.According to several sources, the Chinese government is particularly concerned with multi-billion dollar deals being formed and established outside the country. Considering the increasing debt to ebitda ratio of major Chinese companies, the government believes that limiting the capital of corporations within the country is of utmost importance to its economy.WSJ states:“Total overseas direct investment rose more than 50 percent to $145.9 bln in the first nine months of this year from the same time a year earlier, according to official data.”If passed, the newly introduced regulations on overseas investment will disallow companies from close investments and acquisitions worth more than $1 bln. Companies that already have overseas investment which surpasses the value of $1 bln will be subjected to the new capital controls, which are to be released before the end of 2016.As it did with WMPs, analysts and financial media outlets, including Zerohedge, predict that the demand for Bitcoin will increase significantly. Once the regulations are passed, the impact on the price of Bitcoin could be similar to the effect that the crackdown on WMPs had on Bitcoin. If true, the price of Bitcoin may surge in the range of three to five percent, and based on current average market price, the price will most likely increase by another $20.",14,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Price    #Capital Control  
4 Reasons Why Your Nation Will Kill Cash For A Digital Currency,Evander Smart,9/15/2016 11:05,623,909,"Yes, I’m talking to you. Yes, I’m talking about your country, whether it is Russia, China, or the United States. The more modern and advanced your economy, the faster it is coming your way. The discussions have been going on for a couple of years now on how to do it. The only question is when to spring it on the masses. If you are in a less than a state-of-the-art economy, like Pakistan or Guam, you probably have a lot more time left with the paper. Most of us aren’t so lucky.Cash has been on the clock in the most advanced nations for years, with central banks limiting how much cash you can get, even from your own account. Limits have been dropping to as low as 5000 units of paper in some nations, and even then you will have to surrender your ID or go through some level of interrogation. The future of money does not include paper, and here are four reasons why digital currencies will become your official national currency.Governments are all about control. Whether it is doling out welfare programs and entitlement programs or demanding taxes and regulating your ability to trade or live freely, controlling the populace is the goal. The modern banks work together with the governments to control monetary policy, and between the two, if one control grid doesn’t get you, the other one will.What you spend and where you spend it isn’t actively monitored, yet, but it could be with a phone call, an email, or an SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) at your bank. All of your online, ATM and debit/credit card transactions are on a server, and banks are already abusing this access to your financial life. That’s just what we know, much less is  what we haven’t discovered, yet.Let’s turn this around, and imagine an economy without a digital paper trail. Essentially, let’s go back in time to around World War II before all these computers and plastic transactions ruled the world. Imagine, for a moment, that your country just ran on cash. No debit cards, no checks and no digital currency of any kind. This would create a few problems for your government.How would your government know how many dollars there are in the country, or have left the country? Wouldn’t counterfeit paper currency become a huge underground industry, much larger today than it ever was previously? How would you know how many units of paper currency you needed overall? Do you need more, or less, right now? And plenty of business would be done “off the books” to avoid regulation and taxation.This actually works out pretty well for the citizens, as they have a good level of freedom to use the money as they wish, and to be able to use it privately. This is something most of us have taken for granted as a huge advantage of the old Greenback. It is the most private, and direct way to transmit value. If you use a debit card, Bitcoin, or a wire transfer, you are creating a massive paper trail that can compromise your identity or security, both now and in the future. Some are just now realizing how important these benefits are today.If you are a government, in bed with the banking industry, wouldn’t it serve your control grid much better to phase out cash? More people have smartphones than toothbrushes worldwide. People have become spoiled, and love the easy convenience of doing everything digitally, so take advantage of that reality.A national digital currency can’t be taken out of the country, as China is dealing with the issues of capital outflows undermining their national economy right now. Between the government, and the banks, every transaction, every deposit, and every balance can be tracked, accessed, taxed, or terminated from your own centralized computer mouse in your digital bunker. How sweet is that? Reason #1 this is coming to a nation near you is because it is simply a better mousetrap. Guess who’s the mouse?People who have taken the time to become learned in the world of decentralized digital currencies, like Bitcoin, know full well that it is a far superior system than the funny money ways of the central banks. Bitcoin is not designed to become the global reserve currency or even a national currency. It is designed to be a better alternative that you should have in your portfolio.A problem for Bitcoin is it will take a considerable period of time before the mainstream discovers this truth. The mainstream media, the scammers, and the cyber criminals undermining Bitcoin accounts and exchanges around the world are not going to make mainstream adoption quick and easy. As long as Bitcoin is synonymous with crime and technology that the average person doesn’t understand, there is only so far it will go into the public consciousness.This gives the governments and banks a sweet bit of leverage. What they can do, and are doing, is beginning to use their immense resources to learn how the technology works, knock off the systems, and rebuild them under their own business models. In this gray area of time between the era of early adopters to mass adoption, the economic establishment can come up with their own “future of money” system to transfer people over to, before they figure out that Bitcoin is what they really wanted all along.This is why all of these changes and Blockchain adoptions, within banks and governments, are happening so fast and so furiously. They know it is a race against time. It is only a matter of time before the common man understands that the greater economic system is a centralized hustle built to exploit them. It is only a matter of time before people start using a digital currency built to use on their smartphone. It is only a matter of time before Bitcoin becomes the Internet 2.0, and they know it. So, take the open-source technology, spin it for your own private, centralized, closed-network purposes, and Bitcoin will not be so attractive when you give them Bitcoin-lite, now with more surveillance than ever and true access to 100% of the national economic power.“The Internet” went ‘viral’ after 10-15 years, and Bitcoin is heading into Year #9 soon, so if you were to head off Bitcoin at the pass, now is the time, and the powers that be are sure acting like it. For these reasons, expect sweeping changes in your nation’s currency sooner rather than later.If you are in a major Western nation with a huge GDP like the United States, well over 95% of your money is sent digitally anyway. People have become very well conditioned and trained, like dogs, to spend their money digitally, not via cash. Most major national economic powers have 80+% of their people using plastic or computers to spend their cash. Famously, countries like Sweden are pretty much removing cash from their systems outright this year. A nice beta test that will be scaled up in larger nations in the years to come.Governments won’t have to spend billions of dollars, pounds, or yuan to protect large sums of paper assets in banks, print paper currency, and redesign it to prevent counterfeiting every few years. The entire economy becomes centralized and controlled by one entity. Endless taxes. They can tell you any propaganda they want about why your benefits were slashed this month. What are you gonna do about it?Banks can charge you any fees they want since they will have no competition. You can’t pull your money out of the bank since all the money is their digital code. They would have nothing to give you, even if they wanted to give you “your money.”  Their money is their money and your money is their money. It’s like that right now, but that is the real end game.I shouldn’t need to tell you your economy is in trouble. You should know this better than I would. It really doesn't matter what country you’re in, chances are you are a part of this global recession. You’ve heard of the scourge of negative interest rates from central bankers sweeping the globe. This is a tacit way of admitting that Keynesian economics is a complete and utter failure for society, unless you are a banker, then it is pretty damn awesome.Your economy is in trouble because Keynesian economics built around central planning and manipulating the economy is a total failure, at least for anyone not standing at the top of the economic pyramid. The Austrian, free-market economic model is the greatest system man has ever experienced. This is what was used to build the United States into the world’s greatest superpower throughout most of the 20th century, creating the greatest new technologies, businesses, and military. The problem is that over the last generation the free-market has been corrupted, mutated, and captured by bankers, regulators, and central planners to control and manipulate the markets instead of allowing for market corrections.Everything the central bankers have tried has failed the market. The globalists and collectivists who have orchestrated this financial coup d'etat have won with regulations, higher taxes and protection from competition. They win either way. Their plan either works, or they reset the rules, give kickbacks and favors to their insiders, and make sure that your plan never sees the light of day, literally. (“Big Oil” vs Solar power is a great example of this.)The point is there are no accidents. No coincidences. Everything is happening just as it is supposed to, under the guidance of centralized bankers, regulators, and politicians. This is becoming more and more evident with acronyms like CISA, TTP, TTIP, CETA, SOPA and others designed to pass more and more power to bankers, corporations, and other unelected elite, and take your freedoms and liberties away.There is a whole world of centralization, or a shadowy global  government, if you will, working behind the curtains of life, trying to guide it. Do you really think they have your best interests at heart, while they negotiate this whole new world in secret, behind closed doors?So once the bankers and corporations have inflated the world’s reserve currency into oblivion, have sucked every ounce of economic value out of the dying system they built to fail, and changed every law into their favor, they’ll just turn over the chess board and say:”This is OUR new system. Get used to it, because it is now the ONLY game in town!”You might say “That’s ok. I’ll have Bitcoin!” and that’s always going to be an option, but what happens when their national system doesn’t accept Bitcoin? Why would they? When independent suppliers can’t buy good to sell you for your precious Bitcoin? When the masses never made the turn to Bitcoin, and you become de facto black market? Your Bitcoin might be ‘Digital gold’, but like Gold, it is only so useful in the real-world we are careening into. Gold and Bitcoin may not take you as far as you think it will, a decade from now.Who knows? It is something, a version of the future, that is worth considering. Maybe Bitcoin will grow enough to have its own global goods and services economy? Maybe Bitcoin will become ubiquitous, or maybe the digital currencies of nations will make it an outcast. An economic MySpace. We’ll see.Back in the day, when you went shopping, you used to get a choice on how to handle your groceries. “Paper or plastic?” In the future, your payment will be filled digitally, without you even entering the store. Your last order will be repeated this week, or amended on the store’s website. And your food will just be delivered directly to you…..Or not, depending upon if you are a part of the new national control grid, and you guessed it, it doesn’t accept cash.

"Cryptocurrency Tax Tips, Until Tax Relief Passes: Expert Blog",Robert W. Wood,11/1/2017 21:05,26591,471,"*Expert Blog is Cointelegraph new series of articles by the crypto industry leaders. It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis from industry leaders. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.The IRS says Bitcoin and other digital currencies are considered property for tax purposes. That may sound simple, but it really isn’t, and that complexity can have far-reaching effects. For example, if you use Bitcoin to pay for something worth $500, what does the IRS say? You just sold your Bitcoin. You have gain or loss on the sale, depending on how much you paid for the Bitcoin, and how much it is worth when you sold (presumably about $500).  Is that gain ordinary, or capital; short or long term? It all depends on the circumstances, so buying that $500 item with Bitcoin can get messy. Meanwhile, the IRS is trying to crack down on reporting, since very few people seem to be reporting their transactions. The IRS is using John Doe summonses to obtain data on Bitcoin and other digital currency users, as recently publicized by the Coinbase case.The IRS is even hunting Bitcoin user identities with software. This may make you worry that you could owe taxes, penalties and interest. In extreme cases, the IRS could pursue cases criminally. However, a bipartisan bill, “The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act of 2017,” was introduced in the House by Rep. Jared Polis (D-Co) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Az). It calls for a tax exemption for transactions under $600.If it passes, it would provide a world of tax relief for smaller, day-to-day transactions. Remember, the IRS announced in Notice 2014-21 that Bitcoin and other digital currency is property for tax purposes, not currency. Every time you use digital currency, a taxable event is occurring.A payment made using virtual currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting too. Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable, must be reported on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes. That can mean paying the employee some cash and some Bitcoin, and taking federal withholdings from the cash payment.Virtual currency payments to independent contractors are taxable, and payers must issue Form 1099. This form must be filled out using Bitcoin’s value in dollars at the time of payment, meaning that valuation swings can have brutal tax consequences. So, under the proposed tax bill, any transaction under $600 would be completely exempt.Passage of this legislation would mean not having to worry about keeping track of gains on small transactions. Plus, the proposed law calls for the Treasury Department to provide guidelines for reporting on profits and losses tied to digital currencies. As the IRS and Coinbase continue to spar over user records, it is worth remembering that the IRS used a John Doe summons to get names of Swiss bank account holders from UBS.As a result, offshore banking changed forever, with all other Swiss banks eventually having to release records. In the IRS offshore bank cases, the IRS ended up collecting over $10 billion. Some people are saying that IRS efforts on digital currency might end up following the same kind of pattern.In that sense, for digital currency users and investors, change is coming. The IRS claims that only 802 people declared a capital gain or loss related to Bitcoin in 2015.This suggests that the bulk of Bitcoin transaction are not reported. In 2017, there may be more transactions and more awareness, and more fear. The estimated value of the cryptocurrency economy is something on the order of $162 billion. With millions of transactions and the meteoric rise of Bitcoin from under $100 to over $6,000 in just a few years, the IRS is gearing up. Another IRS enforcement effort involves software. The IRS contracted with a company called Chainalysis to identify owners of digital wallets. From there, matching up transactions and tax returns is not that hard.Taxpayers who have hidden income from Bitcoin and other digital currency sales could face taxes, and potentially big civil penalties. A few cases could even end up as criminal tax cases. So, at a minimum, you want to start keeping track and reporting going forward.  You might want to amend returns for the past too. Any attempted fix after the IRS contacts you is rarely as good as one you do yourself.  Of course, some digital currency users have already been reporting their digital currency transactions on their tax returns.But how do you know if you are doing it correctly?The record keeping and gain and loss determinations can be dizzying. If this bill passes, many transactions would be in the clear. That would be welcome news for the digital currency community. Until then, here are a few more tips.What is the fair market value of digital currency? If it is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, convert it into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate.If you receive virtual currency as payment, must you include its fair market value in income? Yes, report the fair market value in U.S. dollars on the date you receive it.What is the basis of virtual currency received as payment for goods or services? The fair market value in U.S. dollars on receipt.If you “mine” virtual currency, do you have income from mining? Yes, when you mine it, the fair market value is income.Is mining virtual currency a trade or business that subjects you to self-employment tax? You bet. The IRS gets a piece of just about everything. Robert W. Wood is a tax lawyer representing clients worldwide from offices at Wood LLP, in San Francisco.

ICOs “High On Radar” Of US SEC - Regulator Source,William Suberg,6/16/2017 14:53,27137,295,"As markets wait for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to address ICOs, a source has confirmed that ICOs remain “high on their radar.”Quoted by Reuters on Wednesday, a regulator who asked to remain anonymous confirmed the Commission was eyeing the wildly popular fundraising instrument.“I know that this is something that’s high on their radar,” the source confirmed.The speed and unprecedented success of ICO campaigns have brought both joy and sorrow to cryptocurrency and Blockchain investors. Such are the sums involved in the now $90 bln market that many began fearing early on that it would not be long before regulators became involved.“It's like painting a target on yourself. Because, what does an organization like the SEC regulate? They regulate IPOs,” Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh told a recent conference panel.In a guidance Van Valkenburgh published with Coin Center in May, he had noted US authorities should give more concrete statements regarding the legal status of ICOs.“FinCEN should clarify that certain token sales are not currently subject to regulation under the BSA,” he wrote. “Should there be a desire to regulate these activities, FinCEN must engage in a formal rulemaking.”Recent examples of ICOs notably include Bancor, which needed less than four hours to raise $153 mln in its sale on June 12.

Bitcoin Takes Beating in Israel,Jon Buck,6/12/2017 14:53,26774,558,"Bitcoin was dealt a major beating by the district judiciary when they ruled against Bits of Gold, a cryptocurrency broker in Tel Aviv. The company had sought a court order after it was denied servicing by Bank Leumi, a local bank in the area.The bank argued that the very nature of Bitcoin made it impossible for the bank to follow the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Because the recipients of Bitcoin transactions cannot be identified personally, the bank is unable to determine who is receiving the transaction and is therefore unable to obey the law.While the bank did make it clear that Bits of Gold was following the know your customer provisions of the law and was carefully reporting all transactions to the government over certain amounts, the nature of Bitcoin transfers precluded the company from obeying the AML rules.Bits of Gold was following the letter of the law, however, the bank held the right to deny service due to the current legal ambiguity surrounding digital currencies in Israel. Without clear guidelines from the NFSA (national financial supervision authority), the bank was unable to complete its obligatory checks, and could therefore legally refuse service.",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Israel    #Banks  
"Bolivia Calls Cryptocurrency ‘Pyramid Scheme,’ Arrests Advocates",William Suberg,5/30/2017 11:12,15731,786,"Bolivia lawmakers have enacted a crackdown on cryptocurrency use, arresting 60 people at a workshop and describing it as a “pyramid scheme.”In a statement issued by the country’s Financial System Supervision Authority ASFI, its head Lenny Valdivia Bautista said it was necessary to “remind” the population that virtual currency of any kind is “prohibited.”“By way of this formal communication from a competent authority, it is important to urge the population to denounce cases in which people try to take advantage of personal savings and those of families,” Bautista continued.His comments, however serious, struck a highly ironic tone. Governments all over the world have enshrined Bitcoin use in law as a legitimate payment method, and ASFI does produce evidence to support its pyramid scheme accusations.“...We are telling the Bolivian population not to be fooled, not to participate in these closed groups… which take advantage of people and deceive them in order to appropriate their money,” he continued on the subject of a cryptocurrency advocate scheme, members of which were arrested last week.Bolivia’s confusing incomprehension of cryptocurrency appears coupled with even more draconian measures than those witnessed in fellow South American economy Venezuela.The former had arrested members of a mining operation accused of siphoning off too much power from the creaking national grid, a move which had little effect on the explosion of Bitcoin trading seen on exchanges.",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bolivia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Pyramid Scheme  
Major South Korean Exchange Bithumb Partners With BitPay To Corner ‘$200 Bln’ Market,William Suberg,3/14/2018 19:36,23709,370,"South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb has partnered with BitPay to compete in the international remittance market, an executive announced March 13.Speaking to CNBC about the deal, BitPay chief commercial officer Sonny Singh said businesses would now be able to convert invoices to Bitcoin and use BitPay to settle them faster and more cheaply than via conventional bank-based remittance channels.“Cross-border payments between Korea and the West will be a $200 bln industry this year,” he told the network.“Right now, people are doing cross-border payments […] and paying bank wires, FX fees around 4% and it takes about four days. Using Bithumb and BitPay, we’re able to make this a 1% fee in one business day,” Singh continued.- Bitpay on its latest partnership with Bithumb from CNBC.Despite huge trading volumes, South Korea remains an uncertain market for cryptocurrency businesses and users alike. Since December 2017, South Korea has introduced a series of regulations on crypto markets, banning anonymous trading, domestic ICOs, foreign use of domestic exchanges, in addition to banning all government officials from crypto holding and trading.BitPay, which Singh confirmed is on course to process $4 bln worth of payments in 2018, is unfazed by the potential for regulatory upheaval.“We welcome regulation,” he continued, “so I think all the Korean exchanges like Bithumb — they welcome regulations too. We make sure they do proper AML/KYC checks.”Earlier this month, South Korean Woori Bank announced its intention to begin commercialized cross-border remittances using Ripple this year.Bithumb continues to increase consumer awareness of cryptocurrency inside the country, introducing payment terminals to restaurants this month, Cointelegraph reported.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #BitPay    #Bithumb    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Payments    #Banks  
"US: Wyoming Set Precedent By Creating New Asset Class For Cryptos, Hopes to Inspire Feds",Aaron Wood,3/13/2018 19:49,22279,662,"The US state of Wyoming has now created a new class of assets in defining cryptocurrency as “Utility Tokens”, reports Forbes March 13.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Wyoming state legislature passed House Bill 70 on March 6, which effectively exempts crypto from state securities regulations. The bill was signed into law by Governor Matt Mead March 8.The new law excludes developers and sellers of tokens from state securities laws under the condition that they meet a certain number of caveats, namely that it must be used as a token for the exchange of goods and services and must not be marketed as an investment.Co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition Caitlin Long remarked on the important precedent set by the new law:“The state of Wyoming is the first elected body in the world to define a utility token as a new type of asset class different from a security or commodity. This has been a hot topic in Washington D.C. recently, as the SEC considers cryptocurrencies to be securities, FinCEN says they’re generally money, and the CFTC views them as commodities. Now, however, you have a state coming out and defining utility tokens as a new form of property, and property is generally the purview of state law.”Long and other members of the coalition believe that the new precedent may be a framework by which Washington will approach cryptocurrency regulation in the near future. Long added that, “I do believe the Wyoming approach will work under federal securities law and am optimistic the SEC will agree.”House Bill 70 is one of five bills that have recently been turned into law in the state of Wyoming that aim to boost crypto and Blockchain businesses in the state. House Bill 19 amended the state’s money transmission laws that had previously prevented exchanges from effectively operating within the state; Coinbase and two other exchanges actually pulled out of the state in 2015. The remaining three pieces of legislation, all introduced by Long, aim to make Wyoming more competitive in attracting new crypto business.House Bill 101 authorizes Wyoming corporations to create Blockchains to store records and the use of a network to identify shareholders and the acceptance of shareholder votes.House Bill 126 allows the creation of “series LLCs” which are favorable to decentralized protocols as it enables LLCs to establish a compartmentalized series of members/managers, transferable interests or assets, and distributions to members. Senate Bill 111 exempts cryptocurrency from Wyoming state property taxes.Speaking to Forbes, Governor Mead mentioned the proactive measures the state has been taking to turn Wyoming into, “a big technology state” including the establishment of the ENDOW Executive Council; Economically Needed Diversity Options for Wyoming.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Government  
"Coinbase Receives E-Money License For Fiat Activities From UK, Its ‘Biggest Market’",Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/14/2018 12:51,25037,366,"Crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase has received an e-money license from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), according to a blog post by Coinbase UK CEO Zeeshan Feroz published today, March 14.Feroz notes that the license only applies to Coinbase’s fiat activities, not its cryptocurrency dealings. The company’s UK CEO told Business Insider that the “way to think about it is that's all the fiat money that we handle: money in, money out.""The e-money license applies to the UK as well as 23 countries within the European Union, and means that Coinbase can “issue e-money and provide payment services in the UK.”Feroz also told Business Insider that receiving the FCA e-money license is an “approval of the compliance and the KYC processes we have today”, adding:""There's an element of trust here in a business that is regulated by the FCA.""Coinbase’s FCA license will most likely not apply to all of the European Union if Britain doesn’t retain passporting rights after Brexit takes place, Business Insider notes, which would reportedly lead Coinbase to open a new office in the EU.Due to the fact that the European crypto sector reportedly grew “twice as fast as any of [their] other markets in 2017,” with the UK as the company’s “biggest market”, Feroz said that Coinbase places particular importance on its UK business:""The UK is a huge market for us, Brexit or no Brexit. We've got access to a type of talent pool you can't really get anywhere else besides the UK in Europe. We certainly intend to invest significantly in the UK office and the headquarters here.”Coinbase has also become the first crypto exchange to open a bank account in the UK, reportedly at Barclays. Their partnership with Barclays has given the crypto exchange and wallet access to the UK’s Faster Payments Scheme (FPS).Coinbase and its trading platform, Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), had both recently announced the support of Segregated Witness (SegWit), a Bitcoin (BTC) scalability upgrade, to reduce transaction times for their customers.

Swiss Stock Exchange Chairman Sees ‘Upsides’ To Launch Of Crypto Franc,William Suberg,2/26/2018 11:26,23809,340,"The chairman of Switzerland’s stock exchange SIX Romeo Lacher thinks there are “a lot of upsides” to releasing a crypto version of the Swiss franc.Speaking to the Financial Times Sunday, Feb. 25, Lacher said the organization would be “very supportive” of such an initiative, adding that he “doesn’t like cash.”“An e-franc under the control of the central bank would create a lot of synergies - so it would be good for the economy,” he said.Switzerland has adopted an increasingly positive narrative in cryptocurrency and Blockchain integration at national level, despite the reluctance of its banking sphere to endorse Bitcoin itself.The Swiss National Bank (SNB) continued this tone, saying there was “no need” for a so-called “e-franc” at present, following Lacher’s comments.During January’s World Economic Forum in Davos, SNB chairman Thomas Jordan argued that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be regulated similarly to legacy assets and subject to strict controls.“You can’t, on the one hand, heavily restrict cash and on the other hand permit fully anonymous instruments that to a great extent can be used for all manner of transactions,” he decided.Lacher meanwhile shares caution around the future of ICOs in particular.“My worry is that until recently, the value of cryptocurrencies has only been in one direction: up,” he continued. “After the first ICO to collapse, there will be burnt fingers.”Switzerland nonetheless continues to be the prime incubator for ICO funds, contributing the largest amount of cash relative to the number of ICOs launched of any country in the world, new data reports.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Switzerland    #Stocks    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #ICO

"Over Half of Russians Know About Bitcoin Now, Government Ready to Regulate?",Joseph Young,1/24/2018 16:25,26896,351,"More than 56 percent of Russians have already heard of Bitcoin, according to a survey conducted by “All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion, or VCIOM,”  translated by Bitcoin.comThe popularity of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as an emerging asset class amongst the youths in Russia has increased exponentially over the past few months. The survey revealed that 75 percent of individuals between ages 18 to 24 have learned about Bitcoin, and 74 percent of Russia’s capital Moscow’s population is now aware of the cryptocurrency.However, only a minority of the individuals that have already heard about Bitcoin understand that Russian citizens and residents can invest in the cryptocurrency market. Over 16 percent of the individuals with underlying knowledge in Bitcoin still believe investing in Bitcoin is illegal in Russia.For many months, the Russian authorities have teased the regulation of its local cryptocurrency exchange market. In early October of last year, Russian authorities agreed to legalize cryptocurrencies and regulate the country’s cryptocurrency market by licensing exchanges.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was quoted by local media outlet TASS news agency as saying:“The President has spoken of the problems related to cryptocurrencies. These are difficulties regarding ... money laundering and cases that are related to identification issues. That’s why we have agreed that the state should regulate the issuing of cryptocurrencies, their mining and turnover. The state should take all this under control.”At the time, Siluanov and the rest of the Russian government came to a consensus to implement strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies to prevent money laundering and cryptocurrency businesses from running fraudulent operations.In October, the Russian Finance Ministry stated publicly that it plans to regulate the Russian cryptocurrency market by the end of 2017. In December of the same year, Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of State Duma's financial markets committee, noted that a cryptocurrency bill has been introduced and it will likely be adopted in March 2018.""The problem is that we already have a lot of people who acquire [cryptocurrencies] and they are deceived, we need to give people the opportunity to work legally with it, to protect them as much as possible,"" said Aksakov.The Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to set up regulations for the trade of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ICOs and mining by July 2018Earlier this month, the Russian President said in an interview with TASS: “This is the prerogative of the Central Bank at present and the central bank has sufficient authority so far. However, in broad terms, legislative regulation will be definitely required in future.”Moreover, in late 2017, Putin also requested the Russian government to regulate its cryptocurrency mining industry properly, as an increasing number of mining centers have reallocated to Russia to utilize its cheap resources and electricity.Several Russian provinces and cities have also been encouraging cryptocurrency miners to relocate their businesses from other leading regions like China to Russia, as the global cryptocurrency mining industry evolved into a multi-billion dollar market.As shown in the survey mentioned above, more than a quarter of Russians that are already aware of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market still believe that cryptocurrency investment in Russia is illegal, and lack of regulations within the local market is restricting the adoption of Bitcoin.Proper regulation of the Russian cryptocurrency market would likely lead to a surge in interest, demand, and volume, allowing Russia to compete against Japan, the US, and South Korea as a major cryptocurrency market.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Tradings    #Investments    #Putin    #Cryptocurrency Exchange  
Russian Economic Development Minister Calls Bitcoin Worse Than Casinos,Darryn Pollock,10/19/2017 15:45,20310,406,"Russia moves quickly in its push against Bitcoin and other decentralised currencies, as it first issued a ban on access to exchanges, then followed that up with a state-mandated currency.This play is to seemingly control the burgeoning cryptocurrency market within its state borders, allowing the government to be in charge of digital currencies and of course to tax them.The Russian regulatory model is one that is seemingly not against digital currencies, but against ones that are decentralized and not controlled by powerful officials. This has in turn seen more and more of those at the top in Russia come out and slander Bitcoin.Russia’s Economic Development Minister, Maksim Oreskin, has said that Bitcoin is no better than casinos.In a talk at the World’s Festival of Youth in Sochi, Oreskin said Bitcoin had characteristics that made it worse than casinos, state-backed Russian media outlet RT reported.He was speaking on a day which saw Bitcoin suffer its deepest one-day decline in a month, with rumours circulating that the USA may well be clamping down in the near future.“As for Bitcoin, if you look at how the value of this asset fluctuates, it's dozens of percent up, then dozens of a percent down. An asset that can be available for an unqualified investor should not have such characteristics, because it's worse than casinos. First, you earn, then you will lose everything and be left with nothing,"" Oreshkin said.“Those who do not know how to manage risks in instruments with such volatility, should not be able to invest, because in 99.9 percent of cases it results in losses for such people and then they will find themselves in a difficult life situation, which is not good,"" Oreshkin added.In a manner similar to the Russian state capture of cryptocurrencies, the finance minister has his own thoughts on how to deal with Bitcoin in the country.Oreshkin has proposed granting the right to trade Bitcoins only to qualified investors. To get the status, you need to have at least six million rubles in your account ($100,000), make at least 40 transactions a year with a turnover of six million rubles, or have worked for at least two years in a financial institution that traded securities.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Gambling    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tradings    #Investments    #Security    #Transactions    #Government  
Iranian High Council Of Cyberspace Supports Proposals To Regulate Cryptocurrencies,Joshua Althauser,11/28/2017 8:09,25878,258,"Iran’s cyberspace authority, the High Council of Cyberspace (HCC), has claimed that it supports any move to regulate the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin in the country’s jurisdiction. The council has also reiterated the importance of creating and following laws in the country.Based on a report by Irani newspaper Financial Tribune, HCC Secretary Abolhassan Firouzabadi stated that they welcome the regulation of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies and following the rules is a must.""We welcome Bitcoin, but we must have regulations for Bitcoin and any other digital currency ... following the rules is a must.""Bitcoin and other digital currencies are used for various purposes in Iran despite the lack of laws to regulate their use.According to Firouzabadi, the virtual currencies are used in the country in different transactions like payments, trading and mining. He added that there are already mechanisms that are being implemented by the responsible agencies like the central bank to control and supervise the supply of digital currencies across the country.""Mechanisms of control and supervision over the supply of cryptocurrencies are being implemented through the collaboration of the central bank and related entities, but the people must be aware of their risks and dangers on the demand side.""Firouzabadi further clarified that the HCC and the Central Bank of Iran are cooperating in conducting a study on the cryptocurrencies amidst their recent price increases. He added that the process will continue until a definite decision on the issue is agreed upon.Meanwhile, the central bank’s Deputy Director of New Technologies, Naser Hakimi, has recently issued a public warning regarding the risks over the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.

Malaysian Central Bank To Issue Cryptocurrency Regulation In Early 2018,Joshua Althauser,11/24/2017 10:36,26045,706,"The Malaysian central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), is expected to issue a directive to regulate the use of digital currencies in the country in early 2018. The central bank has been discussing and working on a proposed cryptocurrency regulation for some time now and this new development is expected to be hailed by industry players.According to BNM Governor Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim, the introduction of regulations for virtual currencies are intended to prevent abusing the system for criminal and illegal activities and to maintain the stability and integrity of the financial system.“The advent of digital currencies as some have forecast will mark the beginning of a new era in the financial sector. As authorities, we cannot be oblivious to these developments….The banking sector needs to adopt the latest and most advanced technologies to improve its risk management framework.”Under the regulations, individuals who convert their virtual currencies into fiat currencies will be considered as reporting institutions and will be subjected to Malaysia’s Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act of 2001. This means that cryptocurrency transactions will be subjected to laws similar to those imposed on banks.However, the implementation of regulations as a guide for digital currencies would not automatically mean that the virtual tokens are already accepted as legal tender in the country. It is just seen as an indication that the central bank is keeping an open mind on the new wave of innovative technologies being introduced in the financial sector.The expected introduction of digital currency regulations also shows that an interesting future is awaiting the virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin in Malaysia. It remains to be seen, however, if this will lead to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Malaysia    #Central Bank    #Cryptocurrencies    #Markets  
Monetary Authority of Singapore Issues Guidelines on ICOs,Joshua Althauser,11/15/2017 12:18,4605,249,"Despite the assurances that Singapore will not regulate cryptocurrencies, its Monetary Authority of Singapore has issued new guidelines that outline how initial coin offerings or token sales would be treated under the country’s securities laws. The guidelines include several case studies on cryptocurrencies and ICOs.In its Nov. 14, 2017 statement, the Singaporean de facto central bank claimed that the digital tokens sold through the Blockchain-based ICOs could be considered as securities under certain conditions based on the provisions of the country’s Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act.Part of the statement read:""Offers or issues of digital tokens may be regulated by MAS if the digital tokens are capital markets products under the SFA. Capital markets products include any securities, futures contracts and contracts or arrangements for purposes of leveraged foreign exchange trading.""The new guidelines also stated that other laws in Singapore may be used to regulate the token sales conducted in the country. The laws include those that do not ultimately come under MAS’ direct authority.""Digital tokens that perform functions which may not be within MAS' regulatory purview may nonetheless be subject to other legislation for combating money laundering and terrorism financing.”Concerning money laundering and terrorism financing, MAS claimed that it will create a new payments service framework covering firms involved in “the dealing or exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat or other digital currencies.”""Such intermediaries will be required to put in place policies, procedures and controls to address such risks. These will include requirements to conduct customer due diligence, monitor transactions, perform screening, report suspicious transactions and keep adequate records.”In August 2017, MAS officials already announced that certain ICOs will be subjected to the country’s securities laws based on their cryptographic data.Singapore has recently taken the spotlight and became one of the favored countries for ICOs after the China ban on ICOs.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Singapore    #ICO  
Why Financial Regulators Should Study Cryptocurrencies?,Lisa Froelings,11/15/2017 14:15,7524,336,"With the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, many regulators turn to bashing ICOs and Blockchain in general.However, Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Financial Markets Strategy Department Executive Director Yao Loong Ng took a different stance and encourages regulators around the world to have the fiduciary duty to learn about initial coin offerings (ICO) and digital currencies.Ng even highlights that the developments around ICOs and virtual currencies can serve as lessons for regulators.In his comments during a panel discussion at the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) Capital Markets Conference that was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in early November 2017, Ng claimed that the “time to market” for ICOs is significantly lower as compared with initial public offerings (IPO), which could take up to nine months to prepare.""If the process of writing a white paper for [an] ICO and subsequently listing on an exchange could take a matter of days, then clearly it is something that we can learn from.""In August, MAS issued a notice reminding investors to take precautions on the potential risks around ICOs and digital currency-related investment schemes.Meanwhile, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has announced that it is currently drafting relevant regulations and guidelines for functional use cases of virtual assets, including the “secondary market trading of established cryptocurrencies and digital assets.”According to SC Chairman Tan Sri Ranjit Singh, the SC is closely cooperating with Malaysian central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), in the development of a framework on digital currencies. He claimed that the framework is expected to be finalized in the next few months.""Together with BNM, we will look at the area carefully and as SC is in charge of the secondary market, we would craft regulations to ensure that the trading values have the right conditions in place for market integrity and investor projection purposes.""Munish Sharma, consultant at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, discussed the ongoing dilemma that most regulators often struggle with the nascent technology especially in such highly regulated space:“Widely seen as a disruption for the traditional banking and financial institutions, cryptocurrencies have gained significant traction over the last half a decade, at the same time creating a regulatory nightmare for banking regulators across the globe. Governments and their regulatory bodies have been brainstorming for measures to either regulate the growth of cryptocurrencies, as against just letting them proliferate without regulation and interference.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Singapore    #Malaysia    #ICO    #Central Bank

Under the deal, the two regulators will share and utilize information on emerging market trends and developments to promote fintech innovations.According to CSRC chairperson Shiyu Liu, the various developments in the fintech sector have offered several opportunities for the introduction of new financial services and fulfill the needs of investors.“In the past few years, the rapid development of fintech has created ample opportunities to introduce new financial services, enhance financial inclusion and fulfill investors’ needs.”The partnership is expected to benefit both China and Australia as both countries are also major trading partners. In 2016, China is Australia’s largest two-way trading partner in goods and services in a market worth $155.2 bln. China is also Australia’s single biggest market for both exports and imports.Moreover, ASIC claimed that China is the largest market for fintech investments around the world. The China-based major retail payments platforms Alipay and WeChat Pay have an estimated 1.1 bln combined platform users. Investments in fintech projects in China also totaled more than $10 bln in 2016.In his comment on the partnership, ASIC chairperson Greg Medcraft said that the collaboration is a great opportunity for both countries to learn more about the fintech sector.“This Agreement represents an exciting opportunity for us to learn more about the Chinese fintech sector, which is renowned for its success and dynamism. We also look forward to sharing our insights and experiences on regtech with the CSRC.”Liu added:“The Agreement between CSRC and ASIC will provide an effective channel for timely exchange of information on fintech developments and regulatory issues and enhance regulatory cooperation between the two authorities.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #China    #Alipay    #ASIC

Jamaican Police Take Aim at Human Traffickers’ Bitcoin Pockets,Darryn Pollock,10/11/2017 13:30,8072,230,"As part of their strategy to attack the scourge of human trafficking, the Jamaican police are refining their activities to strike at those criminal who are seeking haven in Bitcoin and digital payments.More and more human trafficking perpetrators are switching to digital currencies to help them burrow underground and receive payment for their illicit activities, but the police in Jamaica are on to them.Unfortunately, the human traffic and sex slavery market is far larger than it should be, estimated to be worth around $150 bln. In Jamaica, it is estimated that there are 7,000 women, children and men living in slavery, with their handlers charging anywhere from $2 to $470 for their services.The announcement of the crackdown came at two-day Anti-Money laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism Conference in New Kingston where law enforcement urged traditional banks to collaborate with the police in efforts to track the money trail that is making its way into the formal money system.The police also noted the new challenges that were emerging in the form of digital currencies as these criminals burrow underground to use seemingly anonymous coins like Bitcoin and others.There has been noticeable movement towards cryptocurrencies for criminals, including human traffickers. Their business transactions are kept away from the banks making the money trail much harder to follow. Additionally, these transactions are happening on the dark web.“They are asking for payment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a new factor which creates problems for law enforcers,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Carl Berry.Typically, Bitcoin transactions mask the identity of persons trading the cryptocurrency. But Berry said the Jamaica Constabulary Force has: “crafted a plan to treat with the flow of illicit money. We will hit them in the pocketbook.”Despite the high numbers estimated to be sold into modern slavery in Jamaica, the Island nation recently managed to get itself off an international watch list for human trafficking after securing four convictions and rescuing more than 70 victims.But Berry cautioned that there was a lot more work to do.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Police    #Cryptocurrencies    #Transactions    #Dark Web    #Jamaica

The commission claimed that the personalities who promote token sales could be violating the “anti-touting” laws if they don’t reveal the compensation they received from their endorsements.In a statement that was released by the agency in early November 2017, the SEC claimed that celebrities should disclose any compensation they have received for endorsing token sales to avoid violating the anti-touting laws.""Celebrities and others are using social media networks to encourage the public to purchase stocks and other investments. These endorsements may be unlawful if they do not disclose the nature, source, and amount of any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, by the company in exchange for the endorsement.""Several well-known personalities have endorsed a number of different ICOs in recent months. In September 2017, undefeated boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has promoted the ICO of cryptocurrency credit startup Centra.Actor Jamie Foxx, meanwhile, has endorsed the token sale of Cobinhood, which is advertised as a zero-fee virtual currency exchange. Hotel heiress and reality television (TV) star Paris Hilton has supported the ICO of the venture called Lydian. In 2016, Hilton announced that she is venturing into the new millennium of technology, community and social services.In its warning, the SEC advised that potential investors should not base their decisions mainly on the endorsement of a celebrity.

The government is obliged to respond to a petition that gathers over 200,000 within 30 days.“The government’s basic rule is to prevent any illegal acts or uncertainties regarding cryptocurrency trade, while eagerly nurturing blockchain technology,” Hong announced, continuing:“But, the government is still divided with many opinions ranging from an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading to bringing the institutions that handle the currency into the system.”The extent of public backlash after Justice Minister Park Sang-ki suggested laws were in the works to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and trading was such that the government as a whole was obliged to clarify its position shortly afterwards.“There is no intention to ban or suppress cryptocurrency,” finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in statement Jan. 31.Today’s statement from the government emphasizing the “many opinions” at play makes clear that a final decision has yet to take place in the country.The statements come just a day after another government source suggested a licensing scheme for crypto exchanges could be established following elections in June this year.

End of Japan’s Bitcoin Sales Tax Will Slash Costs for Bitcoin Users,Olusegun Ogundeji,10/18/2016 11:54,133,306,"A proposed plan to end sales-tax collection on purchases of virtual currencies in Japan will likely propel the growth of Bitcoin and other digital currencies as alternatives to fiat according to a report by Nikkei.After the news, more exchange traders were reported joining the Bitcoin’s bandwagon. The market research firm, Seed Planning, estimating the Bitcoin's annual trading volume will soar to 2 trln yen this year.This move could slash costs for buyers and will be another incentive that would motivate existing Bitcoin users in the country that has been described as one of the first to officially recognize digital currencies as money. It could also increase adoption by new users and impact on the price of the top cryptocurrency.  On March 4, 2016, the cabinet in Japan had approved a series of bills which would help the banking sector expand their reach when it comes to information technology businesses.That was a first step on the way for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to play a role in Japan’s financial system. This way these currencies can be better regulated and managed within the country.CEO of BitFlyer, Yuzo Kano, was quoted as saying that the trading volume has been growing at a pace that has not been seen before since this spring.The latest move to end sales-tax is derived from the same legislation that was passed in May that classified virtual currencies as a means of payment - a kind of prepaid payment instrument. Once the law on fund settlements as revised in May, it will come into effect by June next year, it will end the 8% consumption tax that buyers in Japan pay to obtain Bitcoins at dedicated exchanges, along with other fees.According to the Financial Services Agency, European countries and the United States have already eliminated tax on Bitcoin.Aside that, the change would reduce costs for buyers and relieve operators of virtual-currency exchanges of the administrative burden related to the tax, administrative work will also be reduced, according to an official of a major Bitcoin exchange operator:“Japan is the only country among the Group of Seven leading industrial economies that taxes Bitcoin purchases. As of September, about 2,500 stores across Japan accepted Bitcoin as a means of payment for shopping and dining,” said ResuPress, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange operator which plans to let users pay electricity bills with the top digital currency soon.",1,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Taxes  
Japanese Firms Hit by Shortage of Blockchain Experts,Jacob J,8/21/2016 15:40,271,379,"In the race to adopt Blockchain technology and cut costs, financial firms have to deal with multiple challenges. Japanese financial firms have been hit by the most basic of them of all – a shortage of technical experts.The Japanese government has been active in regulating cryptocurrency-based companies. A new law has been passed regulating Bitcoin exchanges, after the Mt Gox debacle. The Japanese Government passed a bill in May 2016, which recognized that virtual currencies have a function similar to money. Japan has also eased regulations, now allowing banks to invest in fintech firms, which is expected to help emerging fintech firms raise capital.Reuters has reported that a shortage of Blockchain experts is hindering Japanese financial firms in adopting Blockchain technology. With few fintech startups in Japan, the number of Blockchain experts whose skills have been honed in cutting-edge technology is low. This situation is expected to persist, as these skill sets can only be developed over a period of time.Unlike English-speaking countries, Japan cannot depend on a quick import of foreign talent to meet its shortages. Japan is not an immigration-friendly country, unlike the US or Canada. The government has a points-based system for allowing highly skilled and educated workers the right to work in Japan. However, there is a language barrier which may prevent people who have no knowledge of Japanese from working with Japanese firms.While there may be a shortage of Blockchain experts, it hasn't stopped Japanese Banks from collaborating with foreign partners like Ripple to fully leverage new technologies. A consortium of 15 banks, including the Bank of Yokohama and SBI Sumishin Net Bank have come together to study the use of Blockchain technology in payment transfers. Through the use of a settlement system developed by Ripple, they plan to cut transfer costs to a tenth of existing levels.

Gox scandal which has given Bitcoin a bad name in Japan.In May, Japan passed a bill that mandated the regulation of Bitcoin and virtual currency exchanges by the Financial Services Agency (FSA).About $4.25 billion (about 430 billion yen) in bitcoins was reported traded in Japan in the January-June half - an increase of about 50 times from the same period in the previous year.However, in July alone, more than 200 billion yen in bitcoins reportedly changed hands. That’s almost half of the recorded trading for six months.There are indications that trading may take off as the regulatory framework catches up with more users to give more legitimacy in the public eye.Japan has risen to become the second Bitcoin market in the world after China, toppling the United States.

Why the European Union is Against Anonymous Digital Currencies,Amelia Tomasicchio,3/26/2017 12:33,886,509,"In a recent announcement, the European Parliament (EU) released a new directive related to the anti-money laundering (AML) issue that focuses particularly on digital currencies, even if the EU considers it to be marginal but with a possibility to increase in the future.The EU Directive 2015/849 - that requires Compliance by June of 2017 - wants to avoid potential money laundering. This is the fourth to address this issue, with the first directive enacted back in 1991.The EU’s definition of money laundering has been changed among the different directives and the latest one is focused on Bitcoin and digital currencies with the goal of a new regulation for wallets and cryptocurrencies admins.From this perspective, it is impossible not to link this directive to the continuous wrong association of Bitcoin to illegal activities.As I wrote in a recent article, can regulation be a good answer to AML-related issues? Regulating or being afraid of something because it might be used for illegal activities is like blaming fiat currencies because they are used to buy drugs or weapons.?ash money and digital currencies, in fact, have a few characteristics in common, especially if you consider their anonymous status. And AML existed even before cryptocurrencies.One of the major cryptocurrencies benefit is its free and anonymous status, considering that they are not controlled by any central bank and that transactions are executed through encrypted systems thanks to the Blockchain.Also, we have to say that Bitcoin is not so anonymous as most people believe; instead we can say that ZCash and Monero completely hide their user’s data.That said, the most recent directive issued in July indicates that digital currencies ""don’t possess the legal status of currency or money"" and ""cannot be anonymous.""The EU went on to say:“The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes. In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies taking up and their potential benefits to spread. The inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.”The EU Parliament also suggested the creation of a central database to register users’ info and wallets addresses, as well as a self-declaration form for the users of cryptocurrencies.Behind this move, the Parliament explained that the main goal is to ""monitor the use of virtual currencies in order to identify suspicious activities.""",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Digital Currency    #Anonymity    #Zcash

Local news media outlet China Daily quoted him saying the development of digital currency is “technologically inevitable.”While the PBoC has been active in monitoring the development of Blockchain and distributed ledger technology, Zhou added that certain applications of the technology should be controlled to ensure they do not propagate too fast:“If they [Blockchain technologies] spread too rapidly, it may have a big negative impact on consumers. It could also have some unpredictable effects on financial stability and monetary policy transmission.”In February 2018, fellow state-run institution Bank of China filed a patent for a Blockchain system-scaling solution.Beijing continues to take a hardline stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, with a ban on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) since Sept. 2017 and continuing crackdowns on the few remaining vestiges of private trading. Last month, China added offshore cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO websites to its “Great Firewall”.While the legal landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies in China has been unpredictable, businesses continue to push against the status quo and maintain connections with the crypto industry both at home and abroad, Cointelegraph reported March 7.",8,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Government    #Banks    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China  
"In Wake Of Global Cyberattacks, Calls For Bitlicensing Grow",Guest Author,5/27/2017 14:29,21880,390,"Netanella Treistman of Israeli law firm Yigal Arnon & Co. examines the growing pressure on global governments to issue Bitcoin licenses to manage the cryptocurrency-related concerns.Earlier this month, hackers executed a global cyber attack, reportedly attacking over 150 countries, including public and health care systems and individual computers. The attackers demanded payment in Bitcoin to unlock computers and return the data.Bitcoin is a non-conventional, decentralized cryptocurrency, based on open-source software, invented by Satoshi Nakamotoin 2009. All Bitcoin transactions are stored in the Blockchain, a distributed ledger and record-keeping system. Mid May 2017 the market capitalization for Bitcoin was around $28 bln.Payment with Bitcoin is assumed to be a transparent and neutral payment method, with lower transaction fees, which is available everywhere (where the Internet is available) without the need to disclose a party's identity.On the other hand, some of Blockchain's advantages can also be considered challenges, particularly issues relating to digital identity, privacy and cyber-security. Additionally, Bitcoin's market value is very unstable, which can result in substantial financial risks. This raises the question whether the use of Bitcoin should be regulated and if so, to what extent?Some governments require a license for digital currency activities while others are contemplating it, in order to manage the cryptocurrency-related concerns, stated above.In New York, for example, where virtual currencies are considered a commodity, individuals can open an online Bitcoin account. However, New York State requires businesses engaged in virtual currency activities that have a place of business or provide services to persons located in New York, to obtain a license for digital currency activities (Bitlicense).The Bitlicense was introduced in 2015 by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and by some it is regarded as controversial. Applying for a Bitlicense is reported to be expensive (including a $5,000 non-refundable application fee) and compiling the application includes extensive paperwork, which may require legal and other outside services as well as many hours of work (which reportedly may result in a total expense between $50,000 to $100,000), making it challenging for smaller companies and startups to apply for the license.The Bitlicense includes several obligations including hiring a compliance officer, consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), cyber security, business continuity, disaster recovery and capital requirements.Following the introduction of the Bitlicense requirements, certain virtual currency businesses, such as Genesis Mining, Kraken, ShapeShift and Bitfinex, did not apply for the Bitlicense but rather left New York and took their business elsewhere in order to avoid the obligation to apply for the Bitlicense.The NYDFS reported having received 22 Bitlicense applications following the filing deadline (August 2015). Shortly following the first applications, Circle Internet Financial Limited (Circle), a mobile payment app using Bitcoin (through Blockchain), was granted the first Bitlicense in New York, followed by Ripple and Coinbase (in 2016 and early 2017 respectively).In 2016, Circle, received an electronic money license from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK, a license for e-money providers (not digital currency specific). Circle's partnership with Barclay's enabled Circle to provide cross-currency transactions (between GBP and USD).The FCA is considering if the current regulation can be applied to Blockchain or if Blockchain specific regulation is required.Other states are expected to follow and issue similar requirements.In 2016 the Bank of England published a working paper revising the consequences of the issuance of a central bank digital currency, implemented via distributed ledgers (such as Blockchain), that competes with bank deposits as a medium of exchange. The paper concluded that under certain circumstances such digital currency could improve the central bank’s ability to stabilize the business cycle and raise the GDP.In the EU, virtual currencies (considered units of account) do not (yet) require a license, however, will be subject to the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive, following its recent revision resulting in customer due diligence which will need to be applied to virtual currency exchange platform.A new regulatory framework proposed in Singapore, may require digital currency exchanges to obtain a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in the future.On the other hand, the MAS recently announced that it has completed a proof-of-concept (POC) in partnership with R3, a distributed ledger technology company (similar to Blockchain), in collaboration with various banks, intended to establish a digital representation of the Singapore dollar for various purposes, including cross-border payments.As per a recent revision to Israeli legislation, virtual currencies will be included in the definition 'financial asset' and provision of service relating to a financial asset will require a license in the near future.Therefore, it appears that regulators will need to find the balance between facilitating the development of innovation and alternative payment methods, while ensuring the economy's and consumers' protection, possibly by way of issuing licenses to companies providing or facilitating (financial) services by using Bitcoin.Assuming the POC conducted in Singapore will indeed prove to be successful and considering the working paper published by the Bank of England, the Israeli regulator may consider implementing new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology.Facilitating transactions with digital currencies, it, among other things, will lower transaction fees and expedite international transactions, while ensuring the consumer's cyber security and privacy by implementing sufficient Know Your Customer and AML regulation, tailored to manage distributed ledger related concerns.

How Monero Took Over Bitcoin's Unique User Base,Joël Valenzuela,9/5/2016 12:00,1240,422,"The early days of Bitcoin gained the first great cryptocurrency a reputation as dirty money. The Silk Road remains one of the first salient examples of a thriving Bitcoin economy, and even now the currency still has yet to completely shake off that reputation. However, as Bitcoin tries to move mainstream, Monero, a very privacy-focused digital currency, has rocketed to the top of the cryptocurrency rankings by going after exactly what took its predecessor to glory.The hard fact of Bitcoin that even hardcore fans must admit is that it’s not incredible enough to make everyone want to jump on board right away. Yes, digital distributed ledger technology is world-changing, and Bitcoin’s decentralized and efficient workings are far superior to what the old financial system can offer, but right now that doesn’t affect the average person’s life.Banking services are highly entrenched and developed, while the Bitcoin economy is still relatively fledgling and niche, meaning that the contrast in the inherent virtues of each is not immediately apparent.In the First World, the average middle-class person can swipe a card and pay instantly at thousands of merchants, shift money from accounts, make online purchases, and send funds around the world.Sure, much of this would be cheaper and faster if done with Bitcoin (especially for international transfers between individuals), but not significantly enough where the average person would care to change their ways. The amount of time required to learn how to use Bitcoin just isn’t worth it to most people, especially if they aren’t properly educated as to all the ways in which they can save money and operate more efficiently.While Bitcoin has certain advantages over the banking system, its benefits really shine for the unbanked. However, how many of the unbanked are lining up to jump on the crypto train? Many of them are lower class laborers or denizens of impoverished countries, meaning they are most likely to have low educational levels, have little disposable income, and spend the vast majority of their earnings locally.For some of the world’s poor, learning about Bitcoin won’t improve their day-to-day, earn-cash-spend-cash lives. For others, the same technological and infrastructural barriers preventing them from using banks also keeps them away from cryptocurrency. And all need significant help and education to get started with profiting from Bitcoin use in the first place.So, who has both the technical education and can derive financial utility from the use of cryptocurrency? Dark market buyers. These are customers who very well may have access to banking services and the education to take full advantage thereof, but nonetheless have a need for an alternative. Because the illegal services they peruse are either denied banking or purposely eschew it for privacy reasons, they need another avenue.Cryptocurrency is a perfectly viable alternative, and because of this Bitcoin gained early traction with services such as the Silk Road.Now, Bitcoin’s claim over the dark markets falls to Monero. The privacy-centric cryptocurrency touted as being impossible to trace, contrary to its competitors seeking more mainstream adoption, deliberately sought out dark market integration. With the Alphabay and Sigaint integrations causing the value to rise over tenfold over the last couple of months Monero’s rise could even lead to illicit Bitcoin users changing stolen coins to cover their tracks.Bitcoin, while struggling to make early gains in the mainstream markets, gained much of its initial popularity in the underground economy.Now that the number one cryptocurrency has moved on to more above-ground uses, Monero, rather than follow these footsteps and seek public acceptance, has gone straight after the source of its predecessor’s former glory. So far, this strategy seems to be paying off, big time.",17,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Monero    #Cryptocurrencies    #Markets  
"Ban All Crypto ‘Dealers’, India Committee Reportedly Tells Government",William Suberg,11/2/2017 16:10,26287,255,"India is reportedly considering Chinese-style exchange ban for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency according to local media reports.A brief article in today’s Economic Times names an unknown government “committee” as having advised lawmakers to “close” merchants and other “dealers” active in Bitcoin and altcoins.No background reasoning was given for the committee’s recommendation, which comes as Bitcoin flourishes in both price and volume in India and in permissive jurisdictions around the world.Hesham Reyman, CEO of Indian exchange Bitxoxo, told the publication the government should focus on “curbing” sales of cryptocurrency involving cash instead of seeking a ban.At the same time, Forbes India this week carried a full feature on fellow major exchange Zebpay, which is currently adding around 200,000 users to its app-based trading platform every month.Full-fledged regulation is several months into the research phase in India, a program at odds with the committee’s alleged desires.“In the event of their closure, buyers can always head out to foreign exchanges,” anonymous experts told Economic Times, appearing confident that the cross-border alternative would be both easily accessible and free of consequences for private traders.In a Q&A session Wednesday meanwhile, Chinese exchange BTCC CEO Bobby Lee suggested China was unlikely to permit exchanges to operate domestically in the foreseeable future.",10,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Government    #Banned Bitcoin    #Bobby Lee    #Bitcoin Exchanges  
Bitcoin Can Be Confiscated From Suspects: Hungarian Justice Ministry Proposal,Guest Author,3/4/2017 11:40,631,295,"The new Hungarian criminal process law will make it possible to confiscate Bitcoins and other virtual currencies from suspects even in the early stages of the criminal process.Experts say the new rule proposal, which was made available for reading in February is in accordance with the international AML (anti-money laundering) regulations, even in the field of cryptocurrencies.According to experts, the passing of the bill will fundamentally change the face of the criminal process and will make mass surveillance legal in Hungary.The authorities will be able to use secret surveillance, mass data surveillance, phone and computer hacking when “reasonable suspicion” arises against a suspect.The Hungarian Ministry of Justice’s proposal was sent to the Hungarian Parliament earlier in February. The new draft law, if passed, will make it possible for the authorities to confiscate electronic data, electronic and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.The Speaker of the House designated the governmental proposal for debate in the Committee of Legislation. Thus the National Assembly is under obligation to debate bills submitted by the Government. In turn the designated committee decides whether it will be debated by the National Assembly at all.According to Cointelegraph’s sources, the Committee of Legislation will pass the bill to plenary reading. It is rare for the Parliament to overrule the position taken by a committee.According to sources of Cointelegraph, the new proposal of the code of criminal process law will be passed by the House in June.Up until now, six different Criminal Procedure Codes existed in Hungary. The first Criminal Procedure Code was in force for more than 50 years. This was followed by the first socialist Criminal Procedure Act III of 1951. There were other two consecutive acts during socialism, Law Decree 8 of 1962 and Act I of 1973, as well as the Criminal Procedure Act XIX of 1998.The new code will make it possible – if there is a reasonable suspicion – to confiscate the suspect’s virtual currencies, as well as electronic data, such as digital keys, wallet addresses and the digital wallet seed.From the proposal, it’s not clear how it will be realized in practice. Though the new proposal mentions the rights of the suspect, the authorities will have much more possibilities to collect digital evidence secretly. However, according to legal experts, the new draft law is far more liberal and legally elaborated than the Investigatory Powers Act in Great Britain.The secret collection of digital evidence, made by the Hungarian secret services and legal authorities, will be possible to implement against cyber criminals, money launderers, hackers and also carders, in the early stages of the criminal process.According to the sources of Cointelegraph, the key category in these cases is “reasonable suspicion.” This means, that if a suspect raises criminal evidence digitally and it becomes known to the authorities, the investigation phase of the criminal process begins.Under investigation, the suspect can be electronically monitored.This means, that under strictly regulated legal conditions, enormous surveillance powers will be available to the intelligence services and the police. The proposal, if passes, legalizes hacking by the security agencies into the suspect’s computers and mobile phones and allows them access to masses of stored personal data.And, if there is enough evidence, the virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even Dash can be seized by the police.Written by Tamas Csizmadia in partnership with http://www.bitcoinbazis.hu",9,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Hungary    #Hackers    #Crimes  
Bitcoin Exchange Receives US Commodity Futures Trading Commission Approval,Jon Buck,7/9/2017 15:20,26372,1169,"In a move that may surprise many in the cryptocurrency world, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that LedgerX has officially been granted status as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF).This represents a major hurdle in the company’s overarching plan of becoming the first federally recognized exchange able to trade Bitcoin options. The final step to this major achievement is the approval from the CFTC as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Once this has been granted, LedgerX will be the “first federally regulated Bitcoin options exchange and clearinghouse to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled Bitcoin options for the institutional market.”The company is now among a very rare breed of only 25 financial groups who have SEF status including Bloomberg and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company had been held back by the need for additional capital to collateralize its trades but was able to garner enough support in a recent round of capital raising.Some would argue that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies demands that government regulatory boards be kept from influencing them. However, their growing popularity has led some to call for greater levels of regulation in order to provide the necessary stability for institutional investors to take part.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Tradings    #USA    #CFTC    #LedgerX    #Decentralization    #Government  
Louisiana State Regulatory Registry Picks New Chairman for Efforts That Will Affect Blockchain Industry,Anthony Coggine,6/29/2017 19:23,6325,224,"Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions Commissioner John Ducrest was named as the new Chairman of the Board of Managers of the State Regulatory Registry. The Office of Financial Institutions (OFI) is responsible for the supervision of various entities which provide financial services to the citizens of the State of Louisiana.The appointment was announced by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) Chairman and Commissioner of Wyoming Division of Banking Albert Forkner saying Louisiana native Ducrest will be tasked to lead the redesigning of the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) which is a key component of the CSBS Vision 2020.“Commissioner Ducrest will lead our efforts to redesign NMLS, with the goal of transforming the licensing process and enabling the streamlining of multi-state supervision. Redesigning NMLS is a key component of CSBS Vision 2020 for fintech and non-bank regulation”.State Regulatory Registry is a subsidiary of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) which manages the business operations of the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS).NMLS is the common platform used by the state regulators to oversee non-banks, such as those in mortgages, money transmission, debt collection and consumer finance which include financial technology companies.Ducrest has been with Louisiana’s Office of Financial Institution for more than 30 years - enough experience to be entrusted with a new role in managing the NMLS.With this new role, the Louisiana regulator will be responsible for ensuring the success of CSBS Vision 2020 for fintech and non-bank regulations whose goal is:“Achieving this vision should result in a regulatory system that makes supervision more efficient and recognizes standards across state lines – actions that will better support start-ups and enable national scale while protecting consumers and the financial system”.As part of its key roles, the CSBS Vision 2020 is also envisions to make it easier for banks to provide services to non-banks, which could potentially affect the regulations involving Blockchain transactions.CSBS is stepping up efforts to address de-risking – where banks are cautious about doing business with non-banks, due to regulatory uncertainty – by increasing industry awareness that strong regulatory regimes exist for compliance with laws for money laundering, the Bank Secrecy Act, and cybersecurity.CSBS Vision 2020 is a series of initiatives designed to modernize state regulation of non-banks, including financial technology firms.Former CSBS Chairman Charles Cooper comments:“Through Vision 2020, state regulators will transform the licensing process, harmonize supervision, engage fintech companies, assist state banking departments, make it easier for banks to provide services to non-banks, and make supervision more efficient for third parties”. ",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Louisiana    #USA    #FinTech  
New Technologies From Cryptography to AI Rapidly Transforming Financial Services: IMF,Jacob J,6/30/2017 11:01,8489,339,"Rapid advances in technology, from cryptography to artificial intelligence, are transforming the competitive landscape in financial services. According to the IMF, fintech firms might be able to provide better services and respond to customer needs for security and privacy. With the development of financial technology, the differentiation between various spheres of finance is getting blurred.Cross-border payments have traditionally been considered as different from domestic banking. Firms like Western Union and MoneyGram have an established presence in the remittances business.Cross-border payments using traditional channels are costly and cumbersome. With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining traction, the boundaries between domestic and cross-border payments have been blurred.There are a number of Blockchain-based remittance companies like Bitpesa, Bitspark and Everex. The potential for cost reduction in cross-border payments is immense.Established market players in the finance sector have a large customer base and manage to keep costs low due to economies of scale.Fintech has shown that by disrupting the business model, it is possible to lower the barriers to entry and challenge established market players.However, there may be regulatory barriers (including stringent requirements on licensing) which may impede the ability of fintech companies to compete with incumbents. The need to trust traditional financial intermediaries like the bank has decreased, with advances in fintech.While Blockchain technology may remove the need to trust a bank to accurately record your account balance and make payments on your behalf, you still need to trust the network.As shown during the Ethereum hard fork, reversal of transactions can occur if the majority of users in a network agree to do so.In the traditional financial system, legislation in certain jurisdictions prohibits the reversal of payments that have been deemed to be completed by the payment systems’ rules.Of course, most payments, including credit card payments, can be reversed if there is an allegation of fraud.While technology has changed the dynamics of the financial services sector, only time will tell whether the changes will be disruptive or if the industry will slowly adapt.Technology will provide regulators with both opportunities and challenges, and they will play a major role in how the fintech sector evolves.International agencies, like the IMF, would also have an important part to play given the blurring of international boundaries in the financial services sector.",1,  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #IMF    #FinTech    #Western Union    #MoneyGram  
"Why US and Europe’s Regulators Plug Bitcoin, Blockchain Access to Legit Financial System",Shivdeep Dhaliwal,4/25/2017 11:37,8333,226,"After declining the approval of the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin ETF, the SEC has recently rejected the proposal of NYSE Arca to list and trade SolidX’s Bitcoin Trust. NYSE Arca is the first all-electronic exchange in the United States and has more than 8,000 exchange-listed securities. In Europe, similar developments took place.The European Central Bank (ECB) has concluded that Blockchain or distributed ledger, the technology that Bitcoin operates on, will not be considered as an option for Eurosystem’s financial framework. Are these rejections from regulators setbacks for Bitcoin and Blockchain?The SEC’s reasons for rejecting the listing of SolidX Bitcoin Trust were similar to those it gave for rejecting the Winklevoss ETF. The SEC in its order states:“The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.”In Europe, the reasoning for not adopting Blockchain for Eurosystem’s financial framework by the European Central Bank is:“There are also a number of functional, operational, governance and legal aspects that need to be carefully weighed before considering the mass adoption of new technologies. At this stage of its development, DLT is not mature enough and therefore cannot be used in the Eurosystem’s market infrastructure.”It is interesting that the lack of regulation or maturity is cited as reasons by regulators for not approving Bitcoin-based financial products and for using Blockchain technology.However, it is the same financial institutions that refuse to regulate these technologies.It is basically now a chicken and egg question, where we have entered a vicious cycle which needs to be broken by a leap of faith.If they are not willing to regulate or trust the “unregulated” technology, things can’t move forward.It is not that these regulators do not appreciate the benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT).As the ECB says in its publication: “If individual market participants use DLT mainly to improve their internal efficiency, the effect on the financial ecosystem will be more limited than in a scenario where a group of core market participants adopt the new technology. A more revolutionary scenario is a peer-to-peer world without any financial intermediaries.”The ECB and the SEC seem to have taken a wait and see approach to Bitcoin and Blockchain.The SEC goes on to say: “The Commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop. Should such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.”While this does leave the door open, the fact is that it may be too late for these regulators and the underlying financial institutions. The world is ready for a new financial system, which is decentralized and where access to wealth is far more democratic than in the system that exists today. It would be prudent for the regulators to take stock.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Europe    #ETF    #Winklevoss Twins  
"Russia To “Recognize” Bitcoin In 2018, Monitor All Transactions",William Suberg,4/11/2017 9:26,2344,608,"Russia has announced it may “recognize” Bitcoin fully in 2018, subject to full transaction monitoring.In line with recent statements by the country’s central bank, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an interview quoted by Bloomberg that a wholly legal position was to be taken on cryptocurrency in the future.Previously, Bitcoin and altcoins had languished in a regulatory gray area, with both users and entities operating in Russia threatened with takedowns and even jail time.In October, state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor blocked access to peer-to-peer marketplace LocalBitcoins nationwide, developers responding by setting up a dedicated mirror site, LocalBitcoins.net.“The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain,” Moiseev said about the government’s latest position.“If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.”While cryptocurrency is still yet to receive official status enshrined in law, a decision on whether it will be treated as an asset, cash or security is due in “mid-2017,” Bloomberg reports.In January, Bank of Russia Deputy Olga Skorobogatova said that authorities “would not like to concretely block anything” and instead “understand how to approach [cryptocurrency] and from this generate a basis for regulation.”",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia  
Bitcoin Withdrawals Expected to Resume As Chinese Exchanges Ask Users For Funds Info,William Suberg,3/21/2017 13:46,865,247,"Chinese exchanges have begun requiring customers to provide details of the source of cryptocurrency funds and where they will be withdrawn to.The information, a first for the Chinese cryptocurrency market, suggests exchanges will shortly re-allow Bitcoin withdrawals after a month-long pause.With this step, we expect #bitcoin withdraws from major exchanges become available soon.In a letter from one exchange, Huobi, translated by local news resource cnLedger, reference is made to “AML regulations by government departments” as the root motivation for requesting the details.The letter states:“According to AML regulations by government departments including the Central Bank and China Banking Regulatory Commission, you are required to provide explanation of the sources of your funds, and the destinations of the crypto-coins you withdraw.”In a curious measure in terms of security, customers appear to be required to turn over exchange login details as part of the procedure.In terms of withdrawal “destinations,” bank account information must be supplied, along with “explanations of the sources of the funds transferred” and “relevant proof that can back up [the explanations].”CnLedger stresses the information is as yet unconfirmed.Chinese Bitcoin investors have renewed trading activities on alternative resources such as LocalBitcoins over the past week ahead of likely regulatory movements.LocalBitcoins trading remains unregulated in China, the market setting constant new highs week on week in the seven days to March 18, transferring over 60 mln yuan.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #AML  
"Bitcoin Users at Risk in India, Reserve Bank Reluctant to Take Actions",Shivdeep Dhaliwal,3/17/2017 17:23,661,321,"There has been a steady gain in interest in Bitcoin in India. India Today pegged the rise of the Bitcoin user base in India by 250 percent since the demonetization of 86 percent of currency carried out in November 2016.Of course, with such a meteoric rise in the popularity of the world’s foremost cryptocurrency also come problems. One of the problems is the rise in fraud and criminal activities. Unscrupulous people are likely to target novice users or people who have limited ideas about how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work.The inability or rather the unwillingness of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to recognize Bitcoin is a major problem for Bitcoin in the country. Not so much in the sense that you can’t buy or sell cryptocurrencies, but more so how to deal with the situation if you are a victim of cyber criminals or fraud and your cryptocurrency gets stolen.The Daily Mail recently published a story about a businessman in India who was defrauded by lures of high returns.The paper writes:“The businessman chose not to file a complaint with police as digital currencies are not recognized by the RBI, even though there are varied views on its transactional legality.”The Indian media is notorious for its sensationalism. It does not help that the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, R. Gandhi has made some rather unfortunate pronouncements regarding cryptocurrencies which have been splashed by Indian papers without providing proper background.The Deputy Governor was quoted by DNA, a Mumbai-based paper as saying about cryptocurrencies at a fintech summit, “They are prone to losses arising out of hacking, loss of passwords, compromise of access credentials, malware attacks etc.”The Indian Express carried this story with the headline “Bitcoins: Virtual currencies pose financial risk.” It should be noted that we covered this topic in the recent past and we made it clear that it was the RBI that had put India into financial jeopardy by carrying out an ill-timed and botched up demonetization.This sort of baseless reporting by the Indian media puts a fear of cryptocurrencies in the minds of people who think that Bitcoin etc are only used by criminals or purveyors of pornography.Users of Bitcoin need access to information, especially in countries like India where cryptocurrencies are just coming into vogue. They also need support from the authorities if they face problems.The Indian police have cyber cells to tackle with online crime. It is important that authorities provide support to people who are using digital currencies. If card fraud can be tackled by the police in India, then they should also investigate instances where people have been robbed off their other digital assets.It would be better if the Reserve Bank would play a more proactive and positive role instead of cringing about how virtual currencies will never replace ‘real’ cash. However, in India, it is often the case that technology outstrips regulations as was the case with Cable TV, which ran in India unregulated for nearly half a decade before the government finally had no choice but to accept the new development.Will Bitcoin leave the regulators in India behind? Most likely so.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies  
Praetorian Group Files To Be First ICO To Sell Registered Security Tokens In US,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/9/2018 20:55,39653,322,"The Praetorian Group, referred to as a “Cryptocurrency Real Estate Investment Vehicle,” (CREIV) has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 6 to register their $75 mln Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as a security offering.If the SEC accepts their registration, the Praeotorian Group will hold the first ever SEC-registered ICO.The filing states that while there will be 200 mln of the Group’s PAX tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain, but the company is registering only the 15 mln offered in the ICO. These real estate-backed tokens will be offered for $5 per token, payable in Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC)  Litecoin (LTC), to what the company confusingly refers to as “accredited investors”.Under US law, an accredited investor is one with a certain financial status — securities offered only to accredited investors in the US can qualify for SEC Rule 506(c) exemption, as messenger app Telegram and photo giant Kodak did for their token offerings, making them exempt from registration with the SEC.The filing references the uncertainty of the classification of ICOs as securities, but add that they think it is more “prudent” to register with the SEC in any case:“Notwithstanding our belief that the PAX token might not constitute a security, we feel given the uncertainties from a regulatory standpoint that it is more prudent to deem the PAX token a security and follow through with the registration process before the SEC and gain the SEC necessary approvals as a registered security.”The purpose of the CREIV is to buy and develop both residential and commercial properties that are undervalued or located in “blighted areas.” Praetorian Group’s aim is to “invest in lower income areas that we believe are poised to increase in value, infuse cryptocurrency into these areas and to fund “Out Reach Programs” to enrich the quality of life for the residents in which we owned properties.”During February’s joint cryptocurrency hearing of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), SEC Chairman Jay Clayton spoke of the need for stricter regulations for ICOs and noted that every ICO the SEC had seen thus far is considered a security.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Real Estate    #SEC    #ICO    #CFTC  
Bill To Allow To Pay Taxes In Bitcoin Passes Arizona House Committee,Aaron Wood,3/8/2018 21:53,25558,564,"The Ways and Means Committee of the Arizona House of Representatives passed SB1091, a tax bill that would allow state residents to pay their tax bills with cryptocurrencies, legislative records show March 7.The bill’s advancement through committee signifies the first of three readings required of each bill by Arizona law. Support for the bill by Republican legislators raises the likelihood of it passing the House, which is ruled by a Republican majority.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the bill passed the Arizona State Senate on Feb. 8. While the bill allows for Arizona citizens to pay their state taxes in cryptocurrency, it also specifies that the state government must convert crypto payments to US dollars within 24 hours of their receipt.A sponsor of the bill Rep. Jeff Weninger cited convenience and the opportunity to attract new business to Arizona as driving forces behind introducing the bill:“...Arizona is going to be the place to be for [Blockchain] and digital currency technology in the future. The ease of use, being able to do it in the middle of the night, being able to do it at home while you’re watching TV. I think in a few years this isn’t even going to be a question.”If the bill passes the state legislature, Arizona will be the first state to accept cryptocurrencies for sums owed to the state government, although other states across the US have introduced similar bills. Both Georgia and Illinois are considering legislation that would accept cryptocurrencies for taxes and license fees.The state of Wyoming is also working on legislation for cryptocurrencies, having introduced a new bill that would exempt crypto from state property tax and securities regulations.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Government  
"Prepaid Debit Cards to Be Heavily Regulated, Bitcoin Cards Will Become Alternative",Joseph Young,10/8/2016 11:24,814,654,"Prepaid debit cards will become subjected to tightened regulations proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by October 2017.According to Lauren Saunders, the associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, the standard of regulation for prepaid debit cards will match that of bank accounts and bank-issued credit cards in terms of loss compensation, fee disclosure, and overdraft fees. Saunders announced:“The rules bring prepaid cards out of the shadows, with protections that in many ways are stronger than those for traditional bank accounts.”Newly implemented regulations will impose:Prepaid debit cards have become increasing popular due to a rising number of users that weren’t eligible to establish bank accounts or credit cards.Most credit card issuers demand a certain amount of minimum monthly wage in exchange for credit lines, to ensure that their consumers are capable of paying back their pre-made transactions.However, because of the difficulty in setting up credit cards, many working class employees and workers prefer to use prepaid debit cards that are sold across the US, in places of their convenience or departmental stores.The regulations of the National Consumer Law Center will deny the only two benefits of using prepaid debit cards, which are: elimination of overdraft fees and strict control of user funds.If debit card issuers begin to impose $35 overdraft fees to hundreds of millions of prepaid debit card users, it will lead to an outstanding amount of fees that were previously unimaginable.“Research shows many consumers turn to prepaid cards to control spending and to avoid overdraft fees,” said Nick Bourke, the director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable Trusts.The outrage of debit card issuers and users also led to the filing of a public letter, which states that the majority of banks and card issuers oppose the newly introduced set of regulations for the benefits of themselves and consumers.“Prepaid Accounts are a valuable product used by a number of types of organizations to make a wide variety of payments. Prepaid cards are also used by the unbanked and underbanked consumers for specific purposes such as travel and remittances as well as an economical and convenient substitute for a traditional bank account,” read a section the letter.“While there is much we can agree upon, the NBPCA has concerns with several of the policy positions taken by the Bureau in the Proposed Rule,” the NBPCA emphasized.Prepaid Bitcoin debit cards like the Bitpay Bitcoin ViSA debit card offers the exact same services as normal prepaid cards without any overdraft fee and subjective regulations. Users can simply top up their debit cards using Bitcoin and utilize card until the balance reaches zero.More importantly, users can monitor balance on a mobile application, which provides consumers just enough control over their funds which the regulations denies.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Debit Cards    #Bitcoin Debit Card  
Poloniex Exchange Suspends All New Hampshire Accounts Due to Govt Regulations,Joël Valenzuela,9/23/2016 14:05,301,145,"Online Cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex has announced an end to service in New Hampshire.Due to regulatory changes, the exchange has announced it will be suspending all accounts from opening new margin positions. All New Hampshire customers are asked to close out all current orders and suspend their accounts indefinitely.In a notice posted on the exchange’s website, as well as sent to select users, Poloniex explains its struggle to maintain services despite a rapidly changing regulatory environment:“Our legal team is working closely with the State of New Hampshire Banking Department and other regulatory agencies to verify that changes in their statutes apply to the services offered by Poloniex and to seek licenses where necessary. This is a nascent industry; as the regulations around it mature, these types of service disruptions may not be entirely avoidable, but we have been and will continue to be proactive in educating regulators and monitoring both existing laws and upcoming changes to these laws so that we can limit interruptions wherever possible.We look forward to welcoming back New Hampshire residents at a future date. Until then, we will do everything we can to help you wind down your account.”New Hampshire has grappled with deregulation of cryptocurrencies for some time now. A group of legislators, many of them accepting Bitcoin donations for their own electoral campaigns, pushed for the state government to accept Bitcoin payments. This legislation was ultimately unsuccessful.On the governmental front, Switzerland seems to have had more legislative success with Bitcoin. Zug, a town in the famed “Crypto valley,” began accepting Bitcoin for government services earlier this year as part of a year-long test run for the currency.Despite the unfortunate development with Poloniex, New Hampshire’s Bitcoin scene is thriving regardless. The state is one of the world’s most Bitcoin-friendly areas, with a wide variety of businesses accepting the currency, including organic farmer’s markets and a burgeoning urban restaurant scene. The state also claims three publicly accessible Bitcoin ATMs, more than all the surrounding states combined and even greater than New York City's per capita.The real strength of the Bitcoin scene in New Hampshire is in the community, as Manchester claimed the longest-running weekly meetup in the world where attendees frequently buy and sell without an exchange. Finally, the state is home to the Porcupine Freedom Festival, a weeklong summer festival where Bitcoin is accepted on the same level (or perhaps more) as Dollars.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Poloniex    #New Hampshire    #Government  
EFF Opposes California's Impractical Bitcoin Regulation BitLicense,Joseph Young,5/4/2017 16:45,7977,214,"The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world since 1990, is opposing California’s impractical Bitcoin regulation proposed as A.B. 1123.In August of 2015, EFF opposed a similar Bitcoin regulatory framework called A.B. 1326, better known as the Californian BitLicense. At the time, members of EFF communicated with the author of the bill and expressed the organization’s concerns to lawmakers.In an article entitled “A License to Kill Innovation: Why A.B. 1326—California’s Bitcoin License—is Bad for Business, Innovation, and Privacy,” EFF wrote:“We have philosophical issues with A.B. 1326—both the type of regulatory scheme it’s proposing as well as the timing of this regulation in relation to the development of new virtual currency technologies—and we also have concerns about how the bill is technically written.”EFF then outlined the following issues with A.B. 1326:In consideration of the above-mentioned philosophical issues with the legislation, EFF urged the state’s lawmakers to observe the cryptocurrency industry, market and landscape as they develop. The organization further emphasized how the irresponsibility of regulating a technology at its infancy could severely affect its industry.As a result of EFF’s contribution and efforts, A.B. 1326 was denied for the second time in 2016. Lawmakers of the state of California came to a consensus that the requirement of significant fees and administrative hurdles to startups within the cryptocurrency industry would prevent the industry to grow, mature and develop.However, this year, a new California BitLicense under the name A.B. 1123 was submitted for review and approval. According to EFF, the new California BitLicense bill portrays the same philosophy and requirements as its previous proposals.Thus, EFF shared with some community members within the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industries that the organization will oppose A.B. 1123. Some community members revealed that EFF plans to take action in the near future.The bill read:“This bill would enact the Virtual Currency Act. The bill would prohibit a person from engaging in any virtual currency business, as defined, in this state unless the person is licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or is exempt from the licensure requirement, as provided.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EFF    #California    #BitLicense  
Bitcoin Price Rally Shows It Has Become Truly Independent of Governments: Experts,Iyke Aru,3/3/2017 9:46,641,513,"Recently there has been a number of global regulatory actions towards Bitcoin, governments have issued warnings, policies and legislation that could be seen as efforts to slow down Bitcoin.Ironically, developments have seen the cryptocurrency increase in market price and trade volumes, as Bitcoin price climbed above gold on March 2.Some see the interventions as deliberate efforts to hinder the development of Bitcoin but others appreciate the same events as necessary towards the proper mainstream adoption of the cryptocurrency.Jason Cassidy, President at Crypto Consultant, says:“While several regulatory developments are being deemed as a negative towards Bitcoin, there have been just as many positive developments in the space. Recently, the Philippines moved to officially recognize Bitcoin as a payment method, looking to bring in regulation and create a legal framework for end users to safely operate within. Similar types of overt recognition of Bitcoin have recently begun taking place in Japan and the UAE as well.”President of Bitwage, Jonathan Chester tells Cointelegraph that people are afraid that those government warnings will end up in an all-out ban the technology, noting Russia and China as typical examples. Chester explains that while an obvious result is that media will focus on the government action instead of the Bitcoin price during this time period, acting as a deterrent to new users, there is another effect. He describes this effect as the uncertainty for businesses. “I personally know of a Russian company that shut down its doors due to the government uncertainty.” He notes that uncertainty does not only hold back adoption, it also stifles innovation, explaining that Bitcoin is a global technology that is resistant to geopolitical manipulation, as we have seen by the reduced effects the PBOC announcements have had on the price. This means that while innovation is stifled in one part of the planet, it flourishes elsewhere, such as in the United States or Japan. In places like Latin America and Africa, where there is a strong need for a store of value that is not easily manipulated by government, an outright ban of the technology will just force the currency into black markets. Many countries in such places already have black markets for the US dollar, so this would not be a new concept in these parts of the world.These warnings and government actions according to Chester do not change the ultimate value proposition of Bitcoin as an incredibly versatile store of value that is incredibly fast, cheap and easy to transact with, assuming you send the correct transaction fee while remaining censorship resistant. So as more people learn about these value propositions, people will find ways to leverage these value propositions in a way that matches their needs.Chester concludes:“If governments ban the technology, it moves underground for use in black markets. However, if the government chooses to work with the technologies and the pioneers building on top of the technology, they will likely reap the benefits of a stronger economic system. This is because people will have more money to spend, instead of worrying about how to send, receive or even store their money. Thus, more commerce and more taxes.”One phenomenon that has been significant even while the assumed resistance from government and regulatory bodies have persisted is the ironic increase in value and popularity of the cryptocurrency.Jeremy Epstein, CEO at Never Stop Marketing holds the opinion that whatever may have happened, Bitcoin was already on its way to improved development.Epstein says:“Bitcoin would have grown anyway with or without the interventions because there is a growing awareness of its inherent value and safety as a ‘store of value.’ Ironically, the government actions are increasing awareness of Bitcoin and leading people to wonder why the government feels so threatened by it.”This according to Epstein leads to a natural inquiry into currencies, money and etc. which invariably allows people to realize that Bitcoin could be a better asset. He also notes that resilience in the face of persecution delivers a positive outcome because this is an idea whose time has come.As Schopenhauer, the German philosopher points out, eventually, the breakthrough is viewed as self-evident.The whole scenario is summarized by Cassidy as, the good simply outweighing the bad. Metaphorically, Cassidy says that cat is now officially out of the bag and Bitcoin is fast becoming a household term. As more countries experience systemic issues with their national currency, Bitcoin will continue to act as an attractive alternative.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #Government    #Gold  
Indian Bitcoin Companies Come Together to Self-Regulate Bitcoin,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,3/1/2017 17:08,855,538,"A number of Indian Bitcoin companies have come together to form the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI). Bitcoin has been remarkably gaining ground in India after the botched up demonetization carried out by the Indian government in November 2016.According to the Times of India, Nishith Desai Associates, an international law firm has been hired to develop “self-regulations” for the industry.The new for self-regulation for the industry arises primarily because there is still no clarity on the legal status of Bitcoin in India.As recently as February 2017, the Indian central bank, The Reserve Bank of India had issued a warning to Indians that hold or trade in the cryptocurrency. India has stringent KYC/AML norms in place though for regular banking, mutual fund and insurance sectors.However, when it comes to Bitcoin, the Reserve Bank has largely been a keen spectator instead of a participant.According to the news agency ANI, a committee has been founded under Saurabh Agrawal, CEO of Zebpay and other members include Sandeep Goenka of Zebpay, Mohit Kalra of Coinsecure, Sathvik Vishwanath of Unocoin, Harish B.V. of Unocoin and Vishal Gupta and Rashmit Gupta of Searchtrade.Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-founder of Unocoin, talking about the formation of DABFI tells Cointelegraph:“The plans to create an association for cryptocurrencies has been there since many years but was not getting materialized. This year, the industry has taken a strong stance to make it happen. This coupled with the warning from RBI that reiterated the risks and issues associated with cryptocurrencies on Feb. 1st, 2017 has given birth to DABFI.”ANI reported Saurabh Agrawal as saying, “This organization aims to drive education and create a market for Blockchain and Bitcoin in the Indian market which is now on the path of the digital economy. Our vision would be to work with regulators and develop a strong framework for our industry to provide required impetus for the growth of the industry.”DABFI would have the mandate to build credibility and also raise awareness with respect to cryptocurrencies in India.However, it would be interesting to note that the cryptocurrency industry in India and elsewhere is one of the few industries that is craving a clear regulatory environment and is almost clamoring for authorities to take notice of their existence.As Sathvik of Unocoin tells us:“Like in most of the rest of the world, the cryptocurrencies are not regulated in India. DABFI will lay down self-regulatory regimes for the trading of Bitcoins and other Blockchain-based digital assets. These trading platforms that sign up with the association will also standardize KYC/ AML/ STRS norms for the member companies.”He also says that apart from this, the organization will build credibility and create awareness about the benefits and risks of CC, liaise with regulators and get clarity on taxation, attract investment and set up incubators to promote startups, build global relations and actively engage with International community, create a public website and regularly print reports on and around Bitcoins and Blockchain.Would self-regulation be enough or would we need more than that to make cryptocurrencies a success in India? Perhaps central bank non-involvement is a blessing in disguise considering the PBOC fiasco earlier this year which led to wild movements in Bitcoin.India is certainly proving to be an interesting test case as we are seeing an India vs. China scenario even in the cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, who will be better off, the country with self-regulation or a heavy-handed state regulator, only time will tell.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Unocoin  
Taiwan Plans To Restrict Cash Purchases In Criminal Crackdown,William Suberg,2/23/2017 16:33,331,193,"Taiwan is becoming the latest country to launch a war on cash, banning its use for transactions involving real estate and ‘luxury’ goods.As Zerohedge reports quoting the Economic Daily News, an unidentified government minister stated there would likely be an outright ban on using cash to pay for such items. Their actual cost, he said, would not play a factor.“With the goal of strengthening the prevention and control of money laundering, Taiwan's Ministry of Justice plans to promote large-scale transactions without cash. The first wave may lock real estate, luxury cars and jewelry transactions,” he said.The main impetus behind the move is allegedly to crack down on criminal activity and money laundering.Targeting criminals - including terrorists - with cash shake-ups has become somewhat vogue in recent times. India, Pakistan and Venezuela have either withdrawn large numbers of banknotes or are currently doing so, ostensibly for the purposes of national security.These markets have all provided excellent opportunities for Bitcoin since the cash policy was initiated, with users flowing into the cryptocurrency as a backup haven.“The Ministry of Justice’s internal data shows that criminal groups’ assets [...] are especially rich in gold, diamonds and real estate,” the Taiwan source continued. “Real estate transactions are considered high-risk money laundering transactions.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cash    #Taiwan    #Security  
"Bank of Canada Says Bitcoin Needs Regulation, Market Disagrees",Joseph Young,2/22/2017 14:57,530,514,"Recently, researchers from the Bank of Canada insisted “private digital currencies like Bitcoin” need regulation to succeed. The market, however, seems to disagree.To begin with, researchers at the Bank of Canada made a fundamental error in studying and evaluating Bitcoin if they considered Bitcoin as a “private digital currency.” The Bitcoin network is an open peer-to-peer protocol where there is no central authority or governing entity. Looking at Bitcoin as a centralized and private network is a severely flawed technical perspective.Unlike actual “private digital currencies” like Blockchain tokens being developed by leading banks and financial institutions, the Bitcoin network is maintained by miners across the globe who contribute computing power to verify transactions and developers within an open source development ecosystem wherein anyone can contribute to the development of Bitcoin.Bitcoin doesn’t need regulation to survive or prosper. Central authorities including the Chinese government chose to regulate Bitcoin because they prefer to oversee the Bitcoin market rather than having it operate in underground markets that are significantly more difficult to regulate.Companies operating within the Bitcoin industry such as Bitcoin exchanges, service providers and development firms are struggling to deal with inefficient and impractical regulations specifically in regions such as New York that require startups to obtain an expensive license to operate.Know your customer and Anti-money laundering policies are also impractical for Bitcoin exchanges to comply with, as exchanges are pressured to transform their infrastructures into a centralized architecture in order to meet the demands of central authorities.In China, when the People’s Bank of China halted withdrawals of OKCoin and Huobi users, two of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the country, the majority of traders moved on to LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer trading platform wherein people directly trade Bitcoin without the presence of a third party service provider or mediator.Researchers at the Bank of Canada are likely describing Bitcoin as a “private digital currency” as they are developing on an altcoin of their own called Project Jasper.Developers of Jasper want to offer an impression to the general public that centralized Blockchain networks like Project Jasper demonstrate virtually no differences to decentralized networks like Bitcoin. However, the global Bitcoin market has already evolved to a point where most users and people have developed an awareness of Bitcoin as a decentralized currency and open network.A part of the white paper released by the Bank of Canada read:“Government issued digital currency will not drive out existing private digital currencies, and government intervention will be required for privately issued and government-issued digital currencies to be a uniform currency.” Already, Blockchain consortia including R3 have given up on developing centralized Blockchain platforms and networks due to serious security issues and potential compromisations. Instead of attempting to mislead the general population regarding the concept of Bitcoin, the Bank of Canada should attempt to describe benefits of private digital currencies.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Canada    #Privacy  
Can You Go to Jail for Trading Bitcoin? Russia is Still Deciding,Alicia Naumoff,2/5/2017 14:38,1233,412,"On Jan. 26, the center for innovations and technologies Digital October in Moscow hosted a conference dedicated to the Regulation of Cryptocurrencies in Russia.The event welcomed more than 250 participants - founders of Fintech startup companies, businesses interested in the integration of Blockchain technology into their operations, members of the Blockchain community and state authorities who are keeping their eyes on the trends in the development of this still bizarre phenomena.Within the last few years, the problems surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia has been discussed many times. State authorities have gone from an intention to ban cryptocurrencies completely and impose legal sanctions to all involved in transacting with cryptocurrency to an initiative to create an offshore cryptocurrency zone.In November 2016, the Federal Tax Authority published its first document addressing the issues surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies.In December 2016, Deputy Chairman of the Bank of Russia Olga Skorobogatova announced that the bank was planning to suggest a few changes to national legislation in order to facilitate the process of development and integration of new technologies, including financial technologies and Blockchain.A few days later, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said that the Ministry of Finance was expecting an enactment of a bill banning exchange operations with the national Rouble and cryptocurrencies, no earlier than in the Autumn of 2017.In January this year, however, we have seen an announcement from the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian Financial Monitoring authority that cryptocurrencies do not represent a threat, therefore, it would not be fair to rush the ban of something which has not been explicitly studied, and instead observe the international practices in this field.As a result of all these rather confusing statements, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Russia remains unclear. Therefore, the main objective of the conference was to shed light on the current state of regulation of digital currencies and create a platform for discussion, as there are numerous questions to be answered.Legal Consultant at Deloitte in CIS countries Ksenia Osipova opened the conference with a brief overview of how the attitude of state authorities towards cryptocurrencies has been changing in the last few years. Thus, within the last three years, the general mood of regulators has changed from strictly prohibitive to discretely permissive, which is demonstrated by the recent open letter from the Federal Tax Service discussing the status of cryptocurrencies. Generally, the letter says that everything, what is not prohibited, is allowed. Osipova explained:“The very fact that this general idea was delivered in an open letter, rather than in an official resolution is very relieving. According to the letter by the Federal Tax Authority, we can conclude that, first, cryptocurrency transactions are not prohibited, and second, that cryptocurrencies are not defined as quasi-money, which was discussed last year.”Moreover, the letter mentions the similarity between cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies and compares it to currency valuables. The latter represents a unit which can be used for transacting. Osipova said that we can expect the introduction of official regulation policies in the near future, which would address issues related to the use of cryptocurrencies for illegal purposes and money laundering.Elina Sidorenko, the head of the working group at the State Duma exploring digital currencies, explained that to this moment, state authorities decided to take a break and look at how other countries are dealing with this issue, so as not to provoke any adverse effects from hasty initiatives.She said:“Everyone is waiting for others to make the first move.”Sidorenko agrees with Osipova in that we will see the introduction of official regulation policies addressing cryptocurrencies and Blockchain initiatives most probably by the end of this year.Generally, Sidorenko emphasized the warming and liberalization of regulator’s attitudes towards cryptocurrencies. She explained that nobody intends to completely ban the use and operations of cryptocurrencies, however, there are many nuances that should be cleared up in order to ensure that the existence of cryptocurrencies in Russia is secured from a legal point of view:“Technology cannot exist in a legal vacuum, to ensure its development we need to create a space of legitimate freedom for it.”Speaking about the regulation of Blockchain, Sidorenko said that soon we will see the development of the model of standardization. In this case, Sidorenko said that nobody is talking about the introduction of bans and restrictions but that it is more about verification, standardization, licensing and defining areas of responsibilities.Alexander Ivanov, founder and CEO at Waves, discussed the experience of other countries in regulating cryptocurrencies. Speculating further, he suggested that it is even possible to shut down Bitcoin - with enough resources and strong political will.However, to this day, no one sees any interest in doing so. Ivanov said that Bitcoin is officially restricted only in Iceland, Ecuador and Bolivia, while other countries are trying to define the status of cryptocurrencies and find ways to deal with them.Ivanov also announced the establishment of the first Russian consortium of Blockchain businesses. Waves and financial group Solvena are among the members of the consortium. Viktor Nasochevsky, the founder of the payment system Rapida, has been announced as the chairman of the consortium.Dimitry Bulichkov, head of the Center for Technology Innovations at Sberbank, gave some hints about the bank’s pilot projects seeking to deploy the Blockchain technology and the potential of this tech. He said that, currently, projects revolving around Blockchain tech are focused on the development and testing of prototypes for interbank communications and the automatization of documents processing.?Bulichkov also mentioned Sberbank’s plans to develop its own digital tokens to use for an interbank payment system.Alexey Arkhipov, CTO at Qiwi, stated that the company is still working on Bitrouble and that the project is currently in a reconfiguration phase and most probably will be released later this year.Sharing his impressions, Alexander Ivanov, who was one of the organizers of the conference, said:“During the last few years, we have seen a lot of confusion developing around regulation of cryptocurrencies. Unsurprisingly, any discussion around Blockchain and Bitcoin would result in somebody saying that the latter is forbidden. To clear up the situation a little bit, and show that the attitude of regulators has indeed changed, we decided to organize this conference. We had very active and fruitful discussions, that proves once again that there is a need for this kind of events in the Russian Blockchain industry.”",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks    #Waves    #Sberbank    #Qiwi  
Running Up That Hill: Here Are All Members of Congress Involved in Crypto,Kirill Bryanov,3/13/2018 15:05,21689,240,"While lawmakers in the increasing number of statehouses are putting forward legislative initiatives that are nothing short of Blockchain-friendly (think Arizona, Wyoming or Georgia), federal policy architects on the Capitol Hill prefer to move one cautious step by another.The month of February, however, has seen Congress finally take issue at heart and favorably incline their collective legislative ear to the SEC’s Jay Clayton’s and the CFTC’s J. Christopher Giancarlo’s crypto testimonies. Not only the landmark hearing laid the groundwork for moving the regulation forward but also elicited some of the Senators’ views on cryptocurrencies and beyond. Amid the building regulatory momentum, we round up what we already know about some of the congressmen’s stances on all things Blockchain. “The Blockchain has boundless potential.”A poster child for a Bitcoin-friendly congressman, Representative Polis was instrumental in creating The Congressional Blockchain Caucus- a bi-partisan group rooting for the expansion of Blockchain technology and promoting hands-off regulatory approach. His initiatives included, among others, a bill that suggested making any cryptocurrency purchase under $600 tax-exempt, as well as a call for binding members of Congress and government to disclose their ownership of crypto assets.Future prospects: Chances are that Polis is leaving the House before the end of the year. In June 2017 he announced his bid for Colorado governor, coming on top of the early polls shortly afterwards. “This is going to create a revolution. It’s so much more than moving microcurrency.”Schweikert, an Arizona Republican, is Polis’ closest confederate in championing the Blockchain cause. He serves as a co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and has co-sponsored multiple bills aimed at expanding and facilitating the use of distributed ledger applications. One of his remarkable initiatives suggested that the Veterans Affairs Department implement a Blockchain system to track veterans’ medical appointments. In the 115th Congress, Schweikert sits on the Committee on Ways and Means.Future prospects: Schweikert will be up for reelection in November 2018 in a race rated by most observers as safely Republican. Some sources speculate that he is considering a run for Arizona governor in 2022. “The US should be the home to this innovation and should embrace these new technologies. In order for these efforts to be successful, it is imperative that we adopt a deliberate, flexible and unified approach to regulation.”Tom Emmer is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. The quote above is from the letter authored by him, Polis, and Schweikert, and sent to the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The message encourages the federal agencies to adopt simple and narrowly tailored regulation for cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology that would allow them to flourish. Congressman Emmer is a member of the US House Financial Services Committee.Future prospects: Emmer will seek reelection in November 2018 in a district that looks solidly Republican. “I was an early investor in cell phones back in the '80s, and I believe #Blockchain has the potential to be just as transformational as cell phones. As our government begins to look at #crypto, I don't think you can separate #cryptocurrencies from the technology they're based on.”In the landmark February hearing Senator Warner earned a reputation of a right crypto-bull, envisioning the market’s capitalization exceed $20 tln by 2020. A successful tech entrepreneur and later Virginia governor, he seems to be a firm believer in Blockchain’s grand promise. Yet, Warner has his concerns, anticipating the need for a serious regulatory effort as the industry grows exponentially. Senator Warner’s current committee assignments are the following: Intelligence, Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Budget, Finance, Rules and Administration.Future prospects: Warner’s term ends in 2021, so there is a chance that he sees his $20 tln prophecy fulfilled during his current tenure. “You can extend disclosure to Bitcoin and you haven’t done anything.” (…) “Disclosure needs to make sense and help people other than the lawyers.”The Louisiana Republican expressed his doubts as to whether the disclosure requirements imposed by Securities Act would work with Bitcoin. Whereas it does not provide clear insight into his overall stance on cryptocurrencies, it might suggest that Kennedy leans towards the commodity side of the larger security-commodity debate. A former Louisiana treasurer, Kennedy serves on the following Committees: Appropriations, Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Budget, Judiciary, Small Business and Entrepreneurship.Future prospects: having assumed the office in 2017, Kennedy’s term does not expire until 2023. “I‘m a total free-marketer, so I don’t want to regulate.” (…)“But if it’s a currency that could destabilize the whole economy, you’re going to have that conversation.”One pattern that is consistent across all of the federal legislators’ comments is that even the most hardline free-market Republicans have some appetite for regulation. Call it a lip service or a thoughtful, balanced position, no one on the Capitol Hill wants to come across as calling for a laissez-faire approach to cryptocurrencies. Brat’s committee assignments: Budget, Education and Workforce, Small Business.Future prospects: Brat will be up for reelection in November 2018 in a Republican-leaning district. “The SEC is properly the lead on the issue.”Congressman Huizenga acts as a Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets. Having observed the explosive growth of cryptocurrency markets in the recent months, he is ready to hand broad regulatory authority over this class of assets to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Future prospects: Huizenga will be up for reelection in November 2018 in a safely Republican district. ""I believe we should encourage digital currencies to implement full anti-money laundry and know-your-customer standards. These protections should empower both our law enforcement and national security professionals to keep terrorists' financing under control, to protect our freedom of using digital currencies...and keep America in the lead of this technological advance.”Speaking about the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Congressman Rohrabacher digressed to argue against banning cryptocurrencies altogether, citing their ability to economically empower those who live under authoritarian governments. Yet, he called for stricter anti-money laundering measures and identity tracking for the sake of national security. Committees: Science, Space, and Technology, Foreign Affairs.Future prospects: In his bid for re-election in November 2018, Rohrabacher is expected to face serious Democratic competition in a toss-up race. “[More regulation is needed] whether it’s against fraud, whether it’s against environmental harms, whether it’s against the use of Bitcoin to foster terrorism.”A California Democrat, Khanna is known for being in favor of tight cryptocurrency regulation. On top of common concerns such as speculative trading, fraudulent financial schemes, and potential for securing funds for terrorism, he doubles down on the need to mitigate environmental risks that cryptocurrencies engender. One of the measures that Khanna seeks to advance is the tax on mining. Committees: Armed Services, Budget.Future prospects: Will face reelection in November 2018 in a safely Democratic district, under a top-two primary system. “I would like to know what steps your members are taking to ensure that the Bitcoin services they provide are not being used to facilitate radical campaigns of abuse, harassment and/or violence against Americans.”Congressman Cleaver’s primary concern is that cryptocurrencies might facilitate supplying resources to white supremacist and other extremist groups that were denied financial services by conventional providers. Rather than pursuing regulatory measures, Cleaver seeks to convey his message to the groups influential among the crypto community, such as the Bitcoin Foundation and the Digital Chamber of Commerce. Committees: Financial Services.Future prospects: Cleaver will seek reelection in November 2018 in a district that looks solidly Democratic. “At this time, virtually all the world’s digital currencies are not compliant with the critical AML/KYC standards we expect of our other institutions. Some in the digital currency world argue that digital finance requires a relaxation of these standards. This is absolutely incorrect.”Former Secretary of State of Texas, Williams is a staunch proponent of holding cryptocurrencies to the same regulatory standards as fiat money. Committees: Financial Services.Future prospects: Williams will be seeking reelection in November 2018 in a solidly Republican district. ”A lot of people don’t realize there’s nothing backing these virtual currencies.”It would be a marvel if in a debate like this no one showed up holding a banner that reads “Your Bitcoin is not backed by anything!” Concerned about the repercussions of speculative cryptocurrency trading, Congresswoman Maloney calls for a tighter oversight on behalf of SEC. Committees: Financial Services; Oversight and Government Reform.Future prospects: Maloney will seek reelection in November 2018 in a solidly Democratic district.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Congress    #Senate    #Government    #SEC    #CFTC  
Philippines: Senator Proposes Stricter Penalties For Crimes Involving Crypto,Helen Partz,3/14/2018 18:25,24201,218,"Philippine Senator Leila de Lima has filed a bill to impose stricter penalties for cryptocurrency-related crimes, due to the complexity of the investigation process, according to a press release from the Philippine Senate published Tuesday, March 13.According to Senate Bill (SB) No. 1694, all crimes described by the Revised Penal Code (RPC) would incur a penalty one degree higher than usual if the crime involved the use of “virtual currency”. De Lima further suggested a seizure of cryptocurrency used in illegal activity, unless it came from a guiltless party. De Lima stated in the press release:""Due to its anonymous or pseudonymous character, law enforcement agencies may encounter difficulty in tracing the user or owner of a virtual currency used in the commission of crimes, thereby necessitating a higher penalty for its use.""According to De Lima, the measures aim to adapt the government’s criminal justice system to what they see as a new type of crime in order to combat more frequent cases of illegal activity involving cryptocurrency. Among those, De Lima listed fake Bitcoin selling, cryptocurrency corruption, using virtual currency funds as payment for illegal products, money laundering, and terrorist financing.""Since virtual currency resembles money, the possibilities are endless,"" the Senator claimed.Currently the Philippine central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), defines cryptocurrency as ""any type of digital unit that is used as a medium of exchange or a form of digitally stored value created by agreement within the community of virtual currency users,"" according to the senate’s post.In February 2017, BSP recognized Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal payment method, stressing that the decision does not constitute an official endorsement by the Philippine government or status as legal tender, as Bitcoin is not issued by the central bank. Later in November 2017, the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced its plans to consider cryptocurrencies as securities.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Crimes    #Philippines    #Government    #Cryptocurrencies  
"Turkey, Iran To Release State-Backed Cryptocurrencies On Heels Of Venezuela’s Petro",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/23/2018 13:57,39544,811,"The governments of Turkey and Iran are both considering developing their own government-backed digital currencies, following on the heels of the Feb. 20 pre-sale of Venezuela’s national oil-backed Petro coin.Feb. 21, a day after the Petro’s launch, Iran’s Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tweeted that Iran’s Post Bank is working on releasing a cryptocurrency:?? ??????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?????? ??????? ????? ?? ?????? ????? ?????? ???? ?? ??? ???? ??????? ???? ???? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ??? ???????? ???? ?? ?? ??????? ?? ????? ?????? ???? ?? ??? ????. ??? ??????? ???? ????? ? ????? ?? ???? ????? ???? ????? ????? ??.""In a meeting with the board of directors of Post Bank on digital currencies based on the blockchain, I [...] prescribed [...] measures to implement the country's first cloud-based digital currency.""Feb. 22, two days after the Petro’s launch, Middle-Eastern news outlet Al-Monitor reported that Turkey’s Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) deputy chair and former Industry Minister Ahmet Kenan Tanrikulu is publically considering launching a “national Bitcoin” called the “Turkcoin”, described in his 22-page report on regulating the crypto market.Tanrikulu’s report comes two weeks after a Feb. 7 CNN Turk interview with Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simse where he mentioned that the government would be preparing to release a national cryptocurrency.Last November, the Iranian cyberspace authority, the High Council of Cyberspace (HCC), “welcome[d] Bitcoin” and announced that they were working with the Central Bank of Iran on a report on cryptocurrencies. On Feb. 21 the Central Bank of Iran said that it was actively working on a way to “control and prevent” cryptocurrencies in Iran.Turkey’s government had previously taken a harsh stance on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, when lawmakers from the Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) said in November, 2017 that trading crypto was “not compatible” with Islam due to its speculative nature and lack of government control.However, Tanrikulu told Al-Monitor that since there is no mention of cryptocurrencies in Turkish law, buying and selling crypto is legal in Turkey:“The use of cryptocurrencies can be considered legal since our law contains no prohibition [...] buying and selling with cryptocurrencies and creating money through Bitcoin mining are not within the scope of criminal activity in Turkey today.”Tanrikulu’s report adds that crypto regulation is definitely needed in Turkey to prevent money laundering and fraud, and that the creation of a government-controlled “bitcoin bourse” is one way to do so.Venezuela’s Petro has been seen by some critics as solely a way for the country to avoid the Western sanctions imposed on the country; Iran is also currently facing international sanctions.The Petro is not the first government-backed cryptocurrency to be launched — the local government in Dubai launched the state-backed emCash in October 2017, and in 2017 Kazakhstan, Japan, and Estonia have all brought up the possibility of releasing their own government-backed cryptocurrencies.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Turkey    #Iran    #Cryptocurrencies    #Venezuela    #Petro    #Government  
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko To Sign Decree Legalizing Cryptocurrencies,Joshua Althauser,11/25/2017 17:09,24888,718,"Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko is expected to sign the draft decree on the Belarusian High-Tech Park (HTP) that will make the use of digital currencies in the country lawful.Under the draft, virtual currencies and initial coin offerings (ICO), as well as mining will already be allowed in the country, while exchanges can trade rubles for cryptocurrencies.According to major Belarusian information technology (IT) holding firm the Belhard Group CEO Igor Mamonenko, the virtual currencies and ICOs should be fully regulated in order to protect all players in the market.“The maximum legalization is needed…The existing laws do not prohibit such activity directly, but it is necessary to reform the legislation so that it protects all participants.”The signing by Lukashenko of a decree to advance the establishment of an IT-focused special economic zone in 2005 has led to the creation of the HTP, which is modeled to the Silicon Valley in the US. Companies that locate in the HTP are exempted from income tax, value-added tax, property tax and land tax.To further attract companies to establish their operations in the park, the new decree was drafted with an aim to facilitate the inflow of foreign investments and integrate new technologies and innovations in the HTP. These new technologies and innovations include the virtual currencies and ICOs.In its report on the decree, local newspaper Tut By Media stated that the decree will lead to the civil circulation of Blockchain technology-based digital currencies in the country.“The decree provides for the introduction into civil circulation of cryptocurrencies and tokens based on the technology of Blockchain. A comprehensive legal regulation is proposed so that HTP residents can provide crypto exchange services, exchange cryptocurrencies, attract financing through ICOs, [and] use cryptocurrencies and tokens in civil circulation.”",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Belarus    #Cryptocurrencies    #ICO  
"Vietnam Bans Bitcoin Payments, Global Markets Unfazed",Alex Gao,11/3/2017 5:03,17320,537,"Four days have passed since the State Bank of Vietnam had announced that cryptocurrencies are illegal means of payment in the country. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the official who shut down Bitcoin payments, has achieved his goal of building the new legal framework for cryptocurrencies in Vietnam. His solution? Ban all cryptocurrencies.Following Indonesia, Vietnam is the second country that officially banned digital currencies and their use as payment methods. However, since both Vietnam and Indonesia didn’t contribute too much to the overall trading volumes, their bans are expected to cause little effect in Bitcoin’s price. The fact that Bitcoin has reached a historic high of $7,300 has proved the expectation.Though the ban won’t influence Bitcoin, it does have an impact on local institutions. A few days ago, the president of FPT, a private Vietnamese university, announced that the university was planning to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment for students’ tuition.According to Dr. Le Truong Tung, the university expected to attract more international students by offering Bitcoin payment options. Now it’s highly likely that the university will have to withdraw the decision.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Vietnam  
The Philippines Officially Legitimize Bitcoin as Payment Method,Joseph Young,2/12/2017 14:43,39346,9733,"Bankgko Sentral ng Pilipinas, hereinafter BSP, is officially regulating local Philippine Bitcoin exchanges as remittance companies and recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method.Earlier this month, BSP Deputy Governor Nestor Espenilla announced the plans of the Philippine Central Bank to issue a proper regulatory framework for Bitcoin users, exchanges and companies. Espenilla emphasized the exponential growth of Bitcoin within the country, stating that monthly Bitcoin volumes increased from $1 mln to $6 mln a month in a year.Almost immediately after the announcement of Espenilla, the Central Bank of the Philippines released BSP Circular No.944 entitled “Guidelines for Virtual Currency (VC) Exchanges,” to provide clarity on the legality of Bitcoin exchanges.In the document, BSP clarified that Bitcoin will still not be considered as an endorsement of the Philippine government nor a legal currency as it isn’t issued by the central bank. However, considering the benefits of Bitcoin as payment and remittance networks, BSP intends to regulate Bitcoin and Bitcoin startups as remittance companies.As soon as the circular takes full effect within the next two weeks, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies are set to be tightened for local Bitcoin exchanges and companies.The circular read:“The Bangko Sentral does not intend to endorse any VC, such as Bitcoin, as a currency since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity. Rather, the BSP aims to regulate VCs when used for delivery of financial services, particularly, for payments and remittances, which have a material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability.”Over the past two years, leading Bitcoin exchanges and service providers such as Coins.ph and Rebit.ph have maintained efficient and close relationships with BSP to ensure their operations are compliant with local regulations.Coins.ph in particular collaborated with BSP to establish necessary AML and KYC systems for its operations. For high profile traders and investors, the Coins.ph legal team required the submission of licenses, government-issued IDs and face-to-face calls.However, the new circular will create a more difficult environment and regulatory frameworks for companies like Coins.ph to deal with. Like New York’s BitLicense, Bitcoin exchanges and service providers will have to pay a registration fee and annual fee of $2,000. That is an initial fee of $2,000 and a recurring annual fee of another $2,000.“A VC exchange shall obtain Certificate of Registration (COR) to operate as a remittance and transfer company […] The provisions of Subsec. 4511.N.2 on the issuance of Bangko Sentral COR, accreditation of remittance sub-agents, registration with the Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat and mandatory training shall also apply to VC exchanges. A VC exchange shall pay the registration and annual service fees as provided under Subsec. 4511N.8,” read the circular.In other words, to be fully compliant with new regulations on Bitcoin, companies will have to apply for a license and be authorized to operate by the Central Bank of the Philippines.For the long-term growth of the Bitcoin industry in the Philippines and mainstream adoption, the transparent and clarified regulatory framework for Bitcoin users and companies will ultimately be beneficial.",7,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Philippines    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Payments    #Banks    #Bitcoin Payments  
"Bitcoin Interest in Netherlands Rises, Police Speeds Up Pending Bitcoin Cases",Joseph Young,1/16/2017 9:36,522,451,"Interest in Bitcoin has increased over the past month, as Google Trends data concerning the search term “Bitcoin” shows. This surge of interest in Bitcoin triggered the Dutch law enforcement to regulate the digital currency and as a result, local prosecutors are speeding up with pending Bitcoin cases.A two-year Google Trends chart on the keyword “Bitcoin” show a drastic increase in Bitcoin interest in late 2013, a period wherein Bitcoin reached its previous all-time high trading value. Google searches on Bitcoin have remained relatively low since then, failing to surpass 30 points out of the maximum 100 for nearly two years.On Jan. 1, Bitcoin surpassed the 50-point mark on Google Trends for the first time in two years, demonstrating a spike of interest in Bitcoin.While it is difficult to form a strong correlation between the rise of interest in Bitcoin and increasing awareness of the Dutch law enforcement in Bitcoin-based criminal activities, local police and authorities are certainly speeding up the process of unraveling illicit Bitcoin operations.On Jan. 3, local publication Het Financieele Dagblad (FD) revealed that the Dutch public prosecution department has three pending cases involving Bitcoin and money laundering.In a statement, the FD further emphasized that the public prosecution department and the local enforcement are allocating a significant amount of resources into the investigation of any criminal activities associated with the digital currency.As of now, there are only three cases pending and awaiting trials, with two of the cases involving money laundering through the usage of Bitcoin. Criminals used Bitcoin to move cash used in illicit activities worth millions of dollars.The third case is a crackdown of an unregulated and illegal Bitcoin exchange which exchanged Bitcoin for euros, mostly for local users in the Netherlands.A crackdown on illicit Bitcoin operations will force Bitcoin-based startups to be more compliant with local regulations. If the government views Bitcoin as a legal tender and has a regulatory framework to supplement its growth, the pathway for mainstream adoption will be established for Bitcoin in the long run.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Netherlands    #Government  
"Life After Official Currencies: Lessons from Auroracoin, Scotcoin",Alicia Naumoff,1/4/2017 19:52,731,161,"After the 2008 global crisis shook the stability of the financial system, we came to a clearer understanding that everything is not a given. It is inevitable that we eventually start revisiting the current state of things and play around with the idea of money seeking to find what we can do differently.Bitcoin came out with a promise of a universal currency that does not correlate with the stock markets and is free from any country’s political decisions. This indeed provides a great advantage in times of political and economic uncertainty, right?However, lately, we have been witnessing an interesting trend with a new generation of cryptocurrencies coming up with a focus on the totally opposite goal - building a money system to solve the problems of specific countries.In February 2014 we saw the launch of Auroracoin, an alternative currency created to address the government’s regulation of Iceland’s krona that has been in place since 2008, severely restricting the movement of the currency outside of the country.The plans of Auroracoin’s creators were expressed in a manifesto:“The people of Iceland are being sacrificed at the altar of a flawed financial system, controlled by an elite that made astronomical bets supported by the government on behalf of the people and ultimately at the expense of the people. The power must be taken away from the politicians and given back to the people.”Icelandic politicians, however, have taken a negative view of Auroracoin. For instance, Pétur Blöndal, a vice-chair of the Parliament’s Economic Affairs and Trade Committee, said that the potential tax evasion through the use of Auroracoin could negatively impact Iceland’s economy. He also emphasized that Auroracoin “is not a recognized currency since no-one backs the medium.”Frosti Sigurjónsson, a member of the ruling Progressive Party and chairman of the EATC, suggested that there is evidence of Auroracoin being a financial scam.There have been other currencies that followed in Auroracoin’s footsteps, promising a revolution in the finance industry.Alternative money has drawn a lot of interest in Scotland, especially following the 2014 independence referendum. Last year, the Scottish National Party’s George Kerevan called on the government to start experimenting with digital currencies, saying that it could be a way for Scotland to reduce its reliance on the pound. He said:“If you were to persuade people there are alternatives to using sterling, one way of doing that, rather than having an intellectual debate, is to show people.”Derek Nisbet, an Edinburgh-based venture capitalist motivated by the Scotland’s uncertain future, has launched Scotcoin:“There is so much uncertainty with the current financial situation, that introducing a voluntary cryptocurrency, which may in the future act as a medium of exchange for the Scottish people, can only benefit them should there be a major disruption.”David Low, the owner of Scotcoin, says that Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are the natural evolution of money, and early adoption would give Scotland an edge in financial technology regardless of its constitutional future. Like other cryptocurrencies, Scotcoin is based on a shared record of transactions, which is definitely a key to improving security and lowering costs compared to traditional banking systems. He is planning to offer the Scotcoin system to the Scottish government, expecting that it can run in parallel to the pound.While the creators of Auroracoin, Scotcoin and alike are hopeful that people will understand the vision of these projects and the good they can do, the community remains skeptical.“I am not from Scotland, but it seems they just use it [independence referendum] to promote their coin. I don’t like a coin that is country-targeted, it should be open to all.” (Robelneo)“All of the country coins are scams. They are artificially pumped up in the value and the volume is ridiculously low. Virtually nobody is buying or selling these coins.” (Sarlangg)It would be overhasty to jump to conclusions about the nature of these currencies and their future. However, it is apparent that, so far, these currencies have not demonstrated any significant take-up. According to British newspaper the Daily Express, the digital Scotcoin is now worth less than the Zimbabwean dollar, with 1,000 Scotcoins amounting to 86 pence.Murdo Fraser, a Conservative shadow spokesperson for Finance, says:“Supporters of independence have got themselves into a complete mess over the currency questions, and the Scotcoin looks like it is another in a long list of failed ideas.”The question is whether these new generation regional cryptocurrencies are really capable of disrupting traditional financial systems.Gavin Smith, CEO at First Global Credit, shared his opinion regarding country-targeted cryptocurrencies. He thinks that the regional coins that have been issued lately have not shown significant take-up due to their unofficial nature. Gavin believes that the real game changer will be when national governments issue Blockchain-based currencies. The Bank of England has discussed this issue extensively over the past 18 months. He says:“While these national cryptocurrencies have all the same disadvantages of the existing monetary system (ability to print more on demand and built-in inflationary bias), they will have the effect of familiarizing the general populace with the concepts around Blockchain-based currencies. Right now Blockchain-based currencies are still new or even unknown to the majority of the world’s populace.”In his opinion, these national cryptocurrencies should contribute to a greater familiarization of the general public with Blockchain and create an environment that could lead to a greater acceptance of the world’s leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, etc. As more and more people realize the benefits of public Blockchains and a genuinely independent currency they will become more comfortable in conducting business on the Blockchain.Speaking in regards to independently issued regional crypto-tokens such as Auroracoin and Scotcoin, Gavin expressed concern that they would be squeezed between two camps - lacking the global benefits of Bitcoin, as well as the government backing of ‘official’ regional cryptocurrencies when they are launched.",2,  #Altcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Auroracoin    #Iceland    #Scotland    #Cryptocurrencies    #Scotcoin  
Finland’s New Law: Bank Account Freedom Means More Data Collection,William Suberg,12/29/2016 14:40,321,178,"Finnish law will enable citizens from any EU state to open a dinosaur bank account in Finland from Jan. 1, but information-sharing could mean this is a mixed blessing.The change brings the country in line with EU directives aimed at providing guaranteed banking services to all, with authorities arguing that such services have become essential.“Access to a payment account has become a precondition for participating fully in the economic and social life of a modern society, given that the use of cash is rapidly decreasing,” a statement from the European Commission reads.Local news publication Uutiset reports that consumers had complained to Finnish watchdogs after being denied banking services and online banking codes due to “bad credit histories” or holding a refugee ID.The law will make such refusal grounds illegal, and also aims to stop banks profiting from online banking setups.Like Estonia across the water, Finland has gone a considerable way to integrating state services, such as public health, so that digital authentication is used for access to a citizen’s personal data.Currently, this is done using online banking codes, but authorities pay “a surprisingly sizable fee” to banks every time a consumer uses one.“More and more public services now require digital authentication to access their online services. This raises the question of who is responsible for paying the service costs,” Juha Pantzar, CEO of Finland’s Guarantee Foundation, explained. “Using a photo ID only requires a one-time payment to obtain the card or passport, while the use of bank access codes incurs a surprisingly sizable fee each time they are used.”According to the Guarantee Foundation, the solution is the Finnish TUPAS system. Developed by the Federation of Finnish Financial Services, it “relies on a selection of passwords, chip cards or fingerprints to verify people’s identities.”However, the volume of personal information required to be handed over just to obtain basic banking services could be more trouble than it’s worth. A cross-EU framework means cross-EU information sharing, and while those with non-EU passports may still face problems, this may be a good place to consider alternatives.As the strength of both Bitcoin as a currency and its accompanying consumer services ecosystem solidifies, there are more alternatives than ever before for anyone to use, regardless of status or nationality.Finland is also home to a thriving Bitcoin scene, with November’s Slush event specifically highlighting Blockchain as a crucial figure in the future of FinTech.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Finland    #EU    #Law    #Bank Accounts  
U.S. Federal Court Approves IRS Collection of Coinbase User Database,Evander Smart,12/1/2016 11:00,737,700,"In a precedent-setting victory for the United States tax authorities, a California federal court has ruled in favor of the IRS serving Coinbase Inc. with a “John Doe” summons. The IRS requires the approval of a federal court in order to issue said summons, which covers virtually all Coinbase users who were clients from 2013 to 2015.The extent of this back-door surveillance is stunning in its depth and scope. Let’s review what the official “John Doe” summons requires of Coinbase:“Complete user profile, history of changes to user profile from account inception, complete user preferences, complete user security settings and history (including confirmed devices and account activity), complete user payment methods and any other information related to the funding sources for the account/wallet/vault, regardless of date.”In addition, the details needed for every single transaction: “All records of account/wallet/vault activity including transaction logs or other records identifying the date, amount and type of transaction (purchase/sale/exchange), the post transaction balance, the names or other identifiers of counterparties to the transaction; requests or instructions to send or receive Bitcoin; and, where counterparties transact through their own Coinbase accounts/wallets/vaults, all available information identifying the users of such accounts and their contact information.”What exactly set all this in motion, affecting several million Bitcoin wallet owners at Coinbase? The official summons identifies exactly one taxpayer, identified as “Taxpayer 1,” and two companies - Taxpayers 2 and 3 - who deal in Bitcoin and who knowingly used Bitcoin to avoid paying taxes required by the IRS. So, in other words, the summons has implicated three taxpayers and Coinbase is now unable to protect the identities of users. Northern California Federal Court Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley sees that as more than enough proof of a system-wide issue at Coinbase.“Based upon a review of the petition and supporting documents, the Court has determined that the “John Doe” summons to Coinbase, Inc. relates to the investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons, that there is a reasonable basis for believing that such group or class of persons has failed or may have failed to comply with any provision of any internal revenue laws and that the information sought to be obtained from the examination of the records or testimony (and the identities of the persons with respect to whose liability the summons is issued) are not readily available from other sources.”Understand that the IRS can issue this “John Doe” summons as long as they have a U.S. federal court’s approval. Any federal court approval, meaning they could have gone from federal court to federal court until they received it, therefore the end result was inevitable. This amounts to a national judicial rubber stamp. There is no check or balances against the IRS to prevent them from any overreach.“As the use of virtual currencies has grown exponentially, some have raised questions about tax compliance,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo, head of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, in an official statement. “Tools like the John Doe summons authorized today send the clear message to U.S. taxpayers that whatever form of currency they use – Bitcoin or traditional dollars and cents – we will work to ensure that they are fully reporting their income and paying their fair share of taxes.”It should be safe to assume that the IRS will utilize this to attack any and all other Bitcoin wallet providers of any notable size, and most likely any sizable Bitcoin exchanges. The U.S. government is renowned worldwide for taking a global view when it comes to Americans and their taxes, and it is the only nation that taxes citizens regardless of their location - see FATCA and GATCA for more information.The moral of the story seems to be that Bitcoin owners are deemed guilty until proven innocent in the U.S. federal court. Three out of a few million wallet owners constitutes a tax evasion crime wave that must be stopped, and the violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution should be overlooked in the pursuit of tax revenue. Score one for mass surveillance.This might be a good time to start investing in a personal hardware wallet, or some other less-centralized source of Bitcoin storage. Coinbase was trying to avoid this outcome to prevent people from looking elsewhere when it comes to wallet creation and Bitcoin funds storage. However, the concept of creating a massive financial honeypot for authorities and regulators to swarm is just as dangerous as keeping huge caches of Bitcoin funds at an exchange for hackers and embezzlers to take. The ethos of Bitcoin is for you to be your own bank and, with each passing day, the wisdom of doing just that becomes more and more profound.As of the writing of this article on Wednesday night, Coinbase had no official comment on these developments, either on their corporate blog or on the Twitter feed of CEO Brian Armstrong.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #IRS    #Coinbase    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #John Doe Summons  
"Korea, Dubai Move to Regulate Bitcoin",Olusegun Ogundeji,11/18/2016 12:10,718,603,"In looking to follow the legal frameworks set by the United States and Japan, Korea is set to become one of the few countries to regulate Bitcoin and its use.The country’s financial regulator, The Financial Services Commission, said on Thursday Nov. 17 that it would introduce regulatory guidelines for digital currency exchanges by the first quarter of 2017, in response to the growing popularity of Bitcoin and other digital currencies traded online in Korea.The Commission notes that the average monthly transactions in 2016 increased by six percent compared to last year, and the top three Bitcoin exchanges in the country processed around 1.5 trillion won - $1.3 bln - between January 2015 and October 2016.Since the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, who currently oversees the registration of Bitcoin operators within the country, does not offer financial regulatory guidelines, the Commission has launched a task force that will discuss the regulatory status of digital currencies and seek to create licensing rules for exchanges.This announcement coincides with the launch of a Blockchain-powered platform for startup companies to trade equity shares on the open market through the country’s securities exchange operator, the Korea Exchange (KRX). The platform, entitled CoinStack and developed by Korean startup Blocko, will focus on document and identity authentication - both in cloud and on location environments - and support all protocols and applications built on the Bitcoin Blockchain.A regional publication, Trade Arabia, has also reported a similar regulatory move by the Supreme Legislation Committee (SLC) of Dubai. It says that the most populous city within the UAE is holding a workshop on Nov. 20 to discuss the present and future legislative policies and legal frameworks for Bitcoin.The SLC Secretary General, Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi, says that considering Bitcoins various differences from traditional currencies, including the lack of a central regulatory authority, there is an urgent need to spread awareness about it so as to focus on the highest level of security and privacy within the virtual world.Dubai is one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE and one of the only two emirates - the other being Abu Dhabi - to hold veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country's legislature.Aside from helping prevent illegal use of digital currency exchanges, which the Korean commission says is “often used for money laundering, drug trafficking and tax-related crimes,” regulation could bode well for the growth of Bitcoin as it will help gain legitimacy in the public eye.Regulations will help win public trust and encourage the onboarding of new users, as is the case in Japan where, within a six-month month period, there was a sharp rise in the amount traded across Bitcoin exchanges in the country, after a bill was passed to regulate it in May. The introduction of regulatory measures seems to have played a crucial role in the recovery process from the Mt. Gox scandal, which had given Bitcoin a bad name in Japan. As a result, Japan has risen to become the second largest Bitcoin market in the world after China, toppling the United States.Introducing a regulatory framework also gives room for initiatives that could adopt the use of Bitcoin for various purposes to thrive. The Swiss parliament moved to regulate on Bitcoin and Blockchain-based startups in June. Earlier, the Swiss town of Zug began to accept Bitcoin payments for certain city services. Today, Switzerland now allows its use for buying train tickets and it is also sold in kiosks across the country.",2,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Dubai  
Increased Economic Protectionism: Threat or Opportunity for Bitcoin?,Jacob J,10/10/2016 15:24,351,246,"The slowdown in the global economy has resulted in many governments imposing protectionist measures in their countries. Could this pose a threat to Bitcoin?Globalization and the corresponding increase in world trade has driven global GDP growth for the last couple of decades. Countries have found their niche areas in the global economy and have flourished – China in manufacturing, India in software, Philippines in Business Process Outsourcing, etc.However, the rapid growth in global trade seems to be plateauing. According to a recent World Trade Organization report, the forecast trade growth rate for 2017 has been cut to 1.8% to 3.1% (from 3.7% previously). There is a possibility that global trade growth would be lower than global GDP growth (forecast of 2.2%)When faced with tough questions about the performance of their economies, politicians have an easy excuse – blame it on other countries. Donald Trump's rapid rise as a politician shows that he could tap into the unease of Americans about immigrants and China taking away jobs.Brexit shows that in spite of London's position as a global financial center, the people of UK as a whole felt that their jobs were threatened by immigrants. Protectionist measures are being imposed by multiple countries in varying degrees, as indicated by the growing number of trade disputes.When a trade happens between 2 parties located in different countries, the question of which currency the trade has to be denominated in arises. If neither of the 2 parties has sufficient bargaining power, the trade is denominated in a neutral, liquid currency like the Dollar.This is a role Bitcoin could easily have slipped into, once it matures, given its ease of transmission across borders. As the Bitcoin community grows and adoption increases, it would acquire the characteristics of a 'mature' currency – liquidity and low volatility. Global trade, if unhindered by protectionism, could be a growth driver for Bitcoin.",2,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Economy    #Tradings    #Brexit    #Donald Trump  
New York Federal Judge Rules That CFTC Can Regulate Cryptocurrencies As Commodities,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/7/2018 12:29,25640,338,"A New York federal judge ruled yesterday, March 6, that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) can regulate cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), as commodities, CNBC reports.U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein’s Tuesday decision was based on the CFTC’s 2015 determination that cryptocurrencies are equivalent to commodities. CNBC reports that Judge Weinstein noted that the CFTC had “broad leeway” in applying federal commodity regulations.Judge Weinstein’s ruling lets the fraud case, initiated in January of this year, continue between the CFTC and New York resident Patrick McDonnell and his company Coin Drop Markets.The CFTC claims in the the lawsuit that customers who paid McDonnell and Coin Drop for crypto trading advice did not receive the advice, and that McDonnell shut down Coin Drop’s website and failed to respond to customers. The lawsuit also notes that Coin Drop was not registered with the CFTC.Weinstein’s addition of a preliminary injunction on March 7 against McDowell and his company has currently stopped either of the two from participating commodity transactions.Since the US does not currently have any singular regulatory body that oversees cryptocurrency regulation, US regulators have long debated whether it is more accurate to align virtual currencies with commodities or securities.In the fall of last year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action against Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), regulating them as securities, while the CFTC’s July 2017 approval of Bitcoin futures trading means they see cryptocurrencies as commodities.A joint hearing between the CFTC and the SEC on their roles in the cryptocurrency sphere at the beginning of last month showed that the two are willing to work together to create a regulatory crypto framework.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #New York    #Cryptocurrencies    #CFTC    #SEC    #ICO  
Texas Regulator Orders Another Crypto Scam To Stop Selling Fraudulent Securities,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/27/2018 15:45,23405,220,"The Texas State Securities Board has issued an emergency cease and desist order on Feb. 26 to website Leadinvest.com, citing a failure to disclose information about its specialists and cryptocurrency mining activities, as well as fraudulently selling unlicensed securities and overall “[threatening] immediate and irreparable harm.”Already in January of this year, the Texas State Securities Board has sent two other cease and desist notices to crypto-related organizations: one to alleged Ponzi-scheme Bitconnect for selling unlicensed securities, and another to “cryptocurrency bank” AriseBank for not actually being a bank, making this Feb. 26 notice the third order of this year.This newest cease and desist order begins by detailing how all of LeadInvest’s staff photos are either stock images or images of other people that have no association with the company.The website is still active but contains older numbers for cryptocurrency prices, like citing Bitcoin’s (BTC) “all time highs of $1000” in 2014 as the last price point under the “Cryptocurrency” section, although different parts of the site have more updated numbers.The cease and desist letter adds that LeadInvest “agents” are told that they will receive a ten percent commission for all new clients that use their referral link, and that LeadInvest is violating securities laws by “recruiting individuals who are not registered with the Security Commissioner to act as its agents.”LeadInvest’s website claims that since their founding in May 2010, then have moved their Bitcoin mining to Iceland due to the access to geothermal and hydroelectric energy. The cease and desist letter writes that LeadInvest intentionally does not disclose information about its mining rigs, as well as the risks associated with crypto mining.Iceland actually has been experiencing a crypto boom of miners coming to the island for this access to both forms of alternative energy and the naturally colder climate.According to data from LeadInvest’s website, more than 190,000 accounts have been created  and more than $177 mln has been invested in their system. The Texas State Securities Board writes that LeadInvest has been deliberately not disclosing the use of the funds that investors have given.The Board’s cease and desist letter ends by citing the “misleading and deceptive statements” made about the identities of people associated with LeadInvest and the statements on the website that promise that investors are adhering to laws and regulations, which Texas says they aren’t.LeadInvest must cease all activities related to selling securities, acting as a securities dealer, fraudulently offering securities, and misleadingly offering securities, as per the cease and desist order.LeadInvest had not responded to requests for comment by press time.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Texas    #Security    #Cryptocurrencies    #Mining  
"Crypto ‘Doesn’t Pass Test Of What A Currency Should Be’, Says Likely NY Fed President",Aaron Wood,4/20/2018 22:26,23075,290,"The expected next president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank said that cryptocurrency “doesn’t pass the the basic test of what a currency should be”, CNBC reports April 20.John Williams, who is currently the head of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank said in a speech Friday that a currency should be “basically something with a store of value.” He added that currencies need to be elastic in order to support varying economic and financial conditions. Williams expressed concern over problems of illicit activity in the crypto community, saying:“The setup or institutional arrangement around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, first of all they have problems with fraud, problems with money laundering, terror financing. There’s lots of problems there… The idea of the supply of currency and thinking about currency really belongs more in the sphere of government and central banks. My view is it’s more a promise of technology.”Williams, who has spent the majority of his career in central banking, has freely admitted that he is “very biased” against cryptocurrencies. Williams is expected to lead the New York Federal Reserve Bank in June, when current President William Dudley will step down.Between the 12 regional federal banks in the US Federal Reserve System, the New York Federal Reserve Bank and its president are considered first among equals. The New York Fed is the largest by assets and the most active by volume. While US monetary policy is decided by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington DC, the New York Fed is where it is implemented. The regulatory structure surrounding cryptocurrencies in the United States is still unclear, making it difficult for crypto businesses to know where they stand in the eyes of regulators. As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, some top investors have appealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to loosen regulations and provide exemptions on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Government    #Banking

The two companies reportedly received subpoenas from US regulators on Dec 6, 2017, with the impetus for the subpoenas still unclear.Tether has also since been under some scrutiny from the crypto community after they dissolved a relationship with their New York-based auditor before an official audit was released. The “stable-coin” issuers recently minted 250 mln more USDT at the end of May, renewing debate about whether Tether has enough cash reserves to back each token with one US dollar as they advertise.The June 5 FOIA request, which was initially submitted in February, asked for ""subpoenas issued to iFinex inc. also known as Bitfinex and it's [sic] subsidiary companies, as well as subpoenas issued Tether Limited and its subsidiary companies.”The CFTC’s negative response to the request noted that it had ""thousands of responsive records, all of which are exempt from the FOIA's disclosure requirement.”The letter cited one FOIA exemption that disclosure could impede their law enforcement activities, as well as another that excludes the records on the ground that ""confidential sources are not lost because of retaliation against the sources for past disclosures or because of the sources' fear of future disclosures.""In response to Cointelegraph’s request for comment, Kasper Rasmussen, the head of marketing at Bitfinex, provided the following statement:""We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations.

"Circle Seeks Banking License, Trading Venue Registration to Expand Crypto Services",Molly Jane Zuckerman,6/7/2018 12:45,13487,219,"Peer-to-peer payments platform Circle Internet Financial Ltd., is pursuing both a federal banking license with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and registration as a brokerage and trading venue with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The news comes from a Bloomberg report today, June 6.Robert Bench, COO of Circle -- which was partly funded in an investment round by Goldman Sachs -- told Bloomberg that obtaining a banking license would cut down on the amount of regulators the platform needed to work with:“You’re able to have a single conversation. It’s hard to have 50 conversations.”Bloomberg reports that Circle will mostly likely focus on SEC regulation before seeking the banking license, noting that registration with the SEC will allow the platform to sell tokens that are considered securities.Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO, noted that Circle has already been delisting tokens that don’t confirm with SEC guidance from digital token platform Poloniex -- which they acquired for $400 mln at the end of February -- and could remove more if they move forward with the SEC:“We’re making our own legal determinations because you can’t call up the SEC and say, ‘Is this a security or not?’ You can expect to see us delist further things and that’s the prudent thing to do.”Bloomberg reports that Circle has also had preliminary talks with the OCC about obtaining a federal banking license. Allaire also told Bloomberg that Circle being able to hold reserves with the Federal Reserve and directly settle with banks through their networks could “improve the efficiency of what we deliver, it can reduce the costs.”Crypto wallet and exchange Coinbase had reportedly also spoken to the OCC about obtaining a federal banking license earlier this year.

Parity Urges Users to Install Update After Discovering Testnet Vulnerability,William Suberg,6/7/2018 15:15,9963,175,"Users of Ethereum software issued by Parity Technologies face enforced updates this week after warnings a testnet vulnerability could spread to the Ethereum network, according to Parity’s blog post June 6.Parity is a UK-based provider of infrastructure software for interacting with the Ethereum network. A blog post from the company June 5 originally flagged the security problem, describing it as a “potential consensus issue with Parity Ethereum.”Alert: Please update your Parity Ethereum clients to 1.11.3-beta or 1.10.6-stable asap. https://t.co/QNxzv74kSFUsers affected would see their transactions fall out of step with the rest of the Ethereum network, leading to them being rejected.Now, any entity running Parity’s software must upgrade to a newly-patched version to mitigate risk of infecting Ethereum’s mainnet, including other Parity users such as Ethereum Classic (ETC).“Please update your nodes as soon as possible and then double check that you are running version 1.10.6-stable or 1.11.3-beta,” the post requests.The fault continues Parity’s chequered history since its inception, with security issues last year earning the company an infamous reputation for funds security.In July, hackers stole 150,000 Ether (ETH) from the service’s wallets, while a further exploit saw a developer accidentally quarantine another 513,000 ETH in November.The headache over how to return the frozen funds to users continues.Meanwhile, social media commentators questioned whether installing a patch would protect Ethereum from the vulnerability. Tendermint developer Adrian Brink even going as far as to suggest it could “break” Ethereum Classic.No exploits yet. Either everyone is very nice, no one knows yet or the Ethereum tooling is hard enough to use to prevent the exploit.This may break $ETC .

"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, IOTA: Price Analysis, June 06",Rakesh Upadhyay,6/7/2018 13:20,44954,255,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Google Trends shows that web searches for the word “Bitcoin” have plunged about 75 percent in 2018 so far. This shows that most people looking to make a quick buck have lost interest in the cryptocurrency. While this is bad news for momentum traders, it is good news for investors because they can buy at lower levels when most of the froth is out of the markets.While Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes that Bitcoin is digital gold, the famous short seller Jim Chanos, is not fond of cryptocurrencies and doesn’t see any use for them in case of an apocalypse.Any new disruptive technology always has its share of skeptics. Interestingly, Bitcoin has been “sent to the graveyard” 300 times already but still, it has always emerged stronger than before and this time is going to be no exception.The central banks around the globe are threatened by the virtual currencies. During a recent panel talk, the representatives of the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank agreed that cryptocurrencies can spell the end of fiat currencies in a “situation of hyperinflation” and if the central banks don’t do a good job.So, should we buy some now or wait for better prices later. Let’s see.Bitcoin turned down from close to the 20-day EMA on June 04 but found support at $7433.34 on June 05. Today, the bears are again defending the overhead resistance zone between the 20-day EMA and $7941.68.   The BTC/USD pair will gain strength above the $7941.68 levels. On the upside, the target objectives are $8,500, $9,000 and $10,000.On the downside, it has supports at $7317.6, $7106 and $6750.The 50-day SMA has flattened out and the 20-day EMA is falling, which shows that the path of least resistance is on the downside. The failure of the RSI to rise above the 50 levels also adds to the negative sentiment.We shall turn bullish after price rises above the 20-day EMA. Until then, we suggest traders to remain on the sidelines.Ethereum has been trading near the resistance line of the descending channel for the past three days. It has not given up any ground, which increases the likelihood of a breakout of the channel.The traders can buy once price reaches $630, with a stop below $570. The target objective of this trade is a rally to $745. There is a minor resistance at the 50-day SMA but we expect it to be crossed.On the downside, the ETH/USD pair will find support at the trendline but if it re-enters into the channel, it can again slide to the support line of the channel. Hence, we suggest a long position only when the price is clear of the channel.Ripple is taking support at the 20-day EMA but has not shown a strong bounce. The flattening of both moving averages points to the possibility of a consolidation in the near term.The XRP/USD pair will turn positive if it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle and will turn negative if it breaks below $0.45.We didn’t find any buy setups at the current levels.Bitcoin Cash has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA for the past three days, which is a positive sign. The 20-day EMA which had been trending down has flattened, whereas, the 50-day SMA continues to trend up. All these indicate that the path of least resistance is up.Historically, the 50-day SMA has not acted as a major resistance, hence, we don’t expect a major hurdle at this level. However, $1306.5585 might act as a resistance. Above this, a retest of the $1600 levels is likely.On the downside, $1060-$955 is the first support zone. The BCH/USD pair will become negative if it drops below $878.Though we are bullish, we didn’t find any reliable setups; hence, we are not suggesting any trade on it.EOS has held the support at $12.9870, which is a bullish sign. It is currently facing resistance at the 50-day SMA. Both moving averages are turning up, which indicates that the path of least resistance is on the upside.   Traders can wait for the EOS/USD pair to trade above the 50-day SMA for four hours and then initiate long positions with a target objective of $18.67. The stops can be kept close to $12.5 levels. If the digital currency struggles to break out of $15.545, the long positions should be closed.Volatility may remain high in the short-term because the virtual currency has just completed a major event. Hence, we suggest keeping the position size at less than 40 percent of usual. This is a high-risk trade.Litecoin has been consolidating in a tight range of $115-$127 for the past seven days. It might pick up momentum once it breaks out of $127. The first target objective on the upside is a move to $140, close to the 50-day SMA. If this level is crossed, the rally can extend to the downtrend line of the descending triangle.If the LTC/USD pair fails to break out of $127, it will continue its range-bound trading action for a few more days.On the downside, it has strong support at $115, and below that at $107 levels. It will become very negative if it breaks down and sustains below $107.We propose a long position on a breakout above $127, with a close stop loss of $115. We recommend to keep the allocation size at only 50 percent of usual because the digital currency is still trading inside a bearish descending triangle pattern.Cardano has been trading near the $0.23 levels for the past three days but has not triggered our recommendation to buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.23.  The moving averages have flattened out, which points to a range-bound action in the short-term.Even if the $0.23 level is crossed, the ADA/USD pair might again face resistance at $0.263 and $0.286 levels. On the downside, the support is at $0.17 levels.As the risk-to-reward ratio is not attractive, we shall withdraw our buy recommendation and wait for a better opportunity.Stellar is struggling to rally above the $0.303 levels. However, the only small positive is that it has not given up much ground after returning from the 20-day EMA on June 04.We suggest to hold the long positions that triggered on June 03 but the stops should be trailed higher to just under $0.27 because the 50-day SMA is flat and the 20-day EMA is turning down, which is a bearish indication. Hence, let’s reduce our risk.If the XLM/USD pair breaks out and closes above $0.303, it should move up to the 50-day SMA at $0.346 and above that to $0.38 levels.Though IOTA has held above the critical support at $1.63 for the past two days, it is struggling to stay above the 20-day EMA, which shows lack of buying support at the current levels.  Both moving averages have turned flat, which increases the possibility of a consolidation in the IOTA/USD pair.The trend will turn negative only if the $1.63 support breaks down. On the upside, a bounce can reach $2 and $2.2 levels.Traders should establish a long position only after a strong bounce from the key support at $1.63.  The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Utility or Security Token: Choosing Between ICO Coins,Darryn Pollock,3/14/2018 16:20,29388,325,"The first version of the article contained inappropriate statement about ICO tokens and US law. We sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding it might have caused.Startup fundraising, in the traditional VC methodology, was flipped on its head in 2017 when a boom in ICO creation saw hundreds of companies forming on the Blockchain with its attached digital currency being born in the form of an investable token. However, this crowdfunding platform which exploded at a rapid rate has finally been hauled in by regulators and authorities who have noticed a few worrying trends. Bodies like the SEC have had a closer look at the tokens coming out of ICOs and in most cases declared them securities.Not all tokens being developed off the Blockchain need to be of a nature that leads them to being classed as securities. There are a few other types of tokens that can be built off the Blockchain, including utility tokens.While there are more than just two types of tokens, including equity, work, share-like and asset-backed, it is important to hone in on two types that can be used to define a new token coming through an ICO- the utility and the security token. In understanding the difference between the two, ICOs can choose a direction that can work better for them on a path of least regulation.Towards the end of July last year, the SEC, on catching up to the ICO craze, dealt a telling blow to ICO regulation going forward. Looking back at the DAO tokens from 2016, the SEC declared that ICO tokens may be securities and subject to federal securities laws.It was never intended for ICO tokens to be securities, but SEC chairman Jay Clayton noted that every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is considered a security and explained that if a crypto-asset issued by a company increases in value over time depending on the performance of the company, it is considered a security. ""You can call it a coin, but if it functions like a security, it’s a security.” He added:“Prospective purchasers are being sold on the potential for tokens to increase in value, ?with the ability to lock in those increases by reselling the tokens on a secondary market ?or to otherwise profit from the tokens based on the efforts of others. These are key hallmarks of a security and a securities offering.”So, by definition, a security token can be found by employing the Howey Test. This test seeks to find if a token has the following attributes- does it offer an opportunity to contribute money and to share in the profits of an enterprise managed and partly owned by respondents? And, secondly, does the scheme involve an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others?Clearly, the most common tokens seen coming out of the majority of ICOs fall into this categorization and thus come under federal law.On the flip side, there is another style of token that can serve a role in many cases where security tokens are being sought at the peril of the company insighting the ire of securities regulators. A utility token can be defined “to represent future access to a company’s product or service. The defining characteristic of utility tokens is that they are not designed as investments; if properly structured, this feature exempts utility tokens them from federal laws governing securities.”There are already some highly successful utility tokens, as Vinny Lingham explains the use of utility tokens for Civic, his identity verification coin. “Civic has created one bln utility tokens that provide access to identity verification-related services in a decentralized, token-based ecosystem,” Ligham wrote on his blog. These tokens represent a unit of account for the network. The bigger the network grows, the more utility in the token, ?and because the number of tokens is fixed. As the size of the network and transaction volumes within it grows, this will create demand for the tokens.”As if to highlight the underutilization of utility tokens, it was reported that of 226 ICOs, only 20 are used in the running of their networks, that is to say, they are utility tokens, according to Token Report.  Storj is another example of a company that utilizes utility tokens, as their co-founder and chief strategy officer Shawn Wilkinson explains: “The Storj tokens we released allow people to use space on the network. We raised half a million dollars through the token crowdsale, and in 2015.” He adds:“For many companies, utility appears to be an afterthought, but for a token to be successfully adopted into the community, it is the most critical component. With the amount of tokens on the market today, and new ones being launched every day, it's clear there is a bubble, though the size of it might be debatable. When the market slows, the tokens that have no utility will ultimately not have any value at all.”Utility tokens can be further explained as coupons for the company and the service it is developing. A real-world example is something like retailers accepting pre-orders of video games that have not been released. It is a token that differs from the usual ICO token that many are used to, and while it is not a perfect fit for every company, there already have been instances where utility tokens have filled a role in place of security tokens letting the Blockchain solution focus on its primary goal. This was seen with Filecoin which raised $52 mln.Of course, as easy as it sounds, choosing a utility token over a ‘normal’ security token to avoid the SEC, there is more to it than that. Some companies will rely on the securities nature of their token, but the standing on it is, there are a lot of companies that won’t.There are an array of different types of utility tokens, each with different characteristics that could encompass an ICOs’ needs. If the company cannot find a place in any of the below categorizations, then they have a case for building a securities token. However, if the token can fall into them, then really, there is no need to create a new native token which could lead them through a regulatory minefield. It is first important to divide tokens into fungible or non-fungible.These types of tokens are ones which are simply interchangeable for one another. The fungible nature of it means that the asset, good or token is interchangeable with one of equal value, and it does not matter about its individuality. Gold is often cited as a fungible asset as an ounce of gold, regardless if it is in coins, ingots or dust, is still worth the same thing.Thus, in terms of a fungible utility token, where they are interchanged for one another, we can see more categorization. For instance, on the Blockchain, there is the possibility for the System Incentive Token, which essentially are used to get people on the network to perform a desired behavior. A company that bases its ICO around this operation does not need a native app and can operate with a host of other tokens.The same goes for a voter token which is another situation where Blockchain and tokens come into play, but again, there is no need for a native securities style token for this. These governance tokens enable those on the network to vote, and clearly, a utility token is sufficient for this. In a similar vein, membership tokens are also classic examples of utility fungible tokens as again, the token is just being used to access the platform, and utilize the services.On the other side of assets, a non-fungible item is one that is unique, such as land, or in the Blockchain space- CryptoKitties.Utility Non-Fungible Tokens are thus mostly used to determine ownership of a specific token or digital asset. So, with a number of ICOs, on face value, clearly fitting into the above-mentioned categories, one has to ask why they decided on a native securities-style token which will lead to regulatory pressures?The definitions of security token and utility token, and even the other ones which are a little more niche are still definitions from a pre-Blockchain era.Dejun Qian, founder of Fusion and the creator of QTUM, which currently sits in the top 20 on Coinmarketcap, explains that tokens are still a very new and unique Idea, and while people try and pigeonhole them, they should really be defined individually.“The reason people try to figure out if token is a security or a utility is because people are thinking which laws the token needs to be compliant with. When people say that the token is a utility, it means that the token is designed and embedded in the Blockchain infrastructure. Naturally, it can then serve as a very important part in the Blockchain. It is very creative and can then also provide a lot if different opportunities for the Blockchain.”But in Qian opinion, we should transcend the bold security vs. utility perspective: “On the other side, there is the token which is regarded as a security. We have current laws covering the securities industry, and there are a lot of things we need to comply with, so people think about it in a similar way. I think we need to put more effort on the utility side, and even something else far beyond only security vs. utility. Because from my perspective, tokens are neither security or utility, it is a new thing and we cannot put a new thing in an existing framework, to determine what it is.""",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Security    #ICO    #Tokens    #Books    #DAO

Thailand’s SEC To Release Crypto Market Regulatory Framework In March,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/13/2018 13:07,16954,295,"Thailand is set to draft legislation that would oversee cryptocurrency trading with the view of taxing the crypto market in the country, the AP reported today, March 13.According to Nathporn Chatusripitak, a government spokesman, Thai Ministry of Finance’s impetus for the proposition of new crypto regulation stems from a desire to prevent money laundering and fraud using cryptocurrencies. The new regulations are expected to be announced “later this month.”In mid-February, the governor of the Central Bank of Thailand released a circular asking all Thai banks to refrain from trading and investing in crypto, as well as prohibiting their participation in and creation of crypto exchanges and trading platforms. This circular referred solely to banks, not crypto exchanges, which are still allowed to operate in the country.Back in September of last year, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (Thai SEC) announced that they would support the implementation of regulations for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).

Tennessee: New Legislation Prevents Crypto Retirement Funds While Legalizing Blockchain,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/11/2018 11:01,25662,282,"Two identical bills in Tennessee have been put forward to prevent retirement funds from investing in cryptocurrencies. Two more that legalize Blockchain use for electronic transactions are also working their way through the House of Representatives and the Senate, according to legislative tracking site Legiscan.House Bill 2093, introduced on January 30, 2018 by Republican representative Michael Curcio, proposes prohibiting “the trustees of any defined contribution plan or related investment vehicle established as a health benefit by the state insurance company from investing in any cryptocurrency.”Another line was later added to the bill, clarifying that trustees cannot invest in crypto “notwithstanding any law to the contrary.”House Bill 2093 is set to move to the Finance, Ways & Means Subcommittee on March 14.Senate Bill 2508, which has already passed by a vote of 10-0 in the Finance, Ways & Means Subcommittee on March 6, was introduced by Republican Senator Bill Ketron on February 1, 2018. Senate Bill 2508 has been recommended for passage to the Senate Calendar Committee.The text of the senate bill is virtually identical to that of the house bill, and also plans to amend Title 8, Chapter 27, Part 8, by adding the following section:“Nothing in this part prohibits a local education agency from participating in any other post-employment benefits investment trust.”In conjunction with the bills banning retirement fund crypto investment, two other bills regarding the legalization of Blockchain technologies have been passing in through Tennessee legislature.Tennessee House Bill 1507, introduced on January 10, 2018 by 12 Democratic and Republican representatives, seeks to “[recognize] the legal authority to use Blockchain technology and smart contracts in conducting electronic transactions; protects ownership rights of certain information secured by Blockchain technology.”Senate Bill 1662, which is again identical in text to the Blockchain House Bill, has passed in the Senate on March 8, 90-0. The Senate bipartisan bill was introduced by two Democratic Senators, Lee Harris and Jeff Yarbro, along with two Republican Senators, Steven Dickerson and Richard Briggs.Cryptocurrency regulation attracted bipartisan movements in mid-February of this year, for legislators on both sides of party lines have recently seen a need for regulation after the growing interest in cryptocurrency across the US.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #USA  
"US: Republican, Democrat Officials Calling For Crypto Regulation In Rare Show Of Unity",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/19/2018 16:13,39912,370,"A bipartisan movement of US lawmakers are considering forming new legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies, prompted by the increasing interest - and therefore risk - in cryptocurrency worldwide, according to Reuters.There is currently no singular body in charge of overseeing cryptocurrencies in the US-- the responsibility is instead divided between individual states, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Treasury Department, and the Federal Reserve.The SEC and the CFTC did hold a joint hearing on Feb. 6 on their roles in cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technologies, and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). The general conclusion was that the two bodies would work together to create a regulatory framework, with the strictest regulations for ICOs and the most loose for Blockchain and digital ledger technology.The hearing also concluded that cryptocurrencies will need protective regulation against market manipulation and fraud.Republican Senator Mike Rounds, a Senate Banking Committee member, was prompted to insert himself into the crypto regulation debate due to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies:“Six months ago, we didn’t see this explosion. The marketplace has changed.”Rounds told Reuters, that while there is, “no question about the fact that there is a need for a regulatory framework,” he sees a chance for crypto to be regulated as both a commodity and a security.The global debate over whether cryptocurrencies and ICOs should be regulated as securities has already led to some concrete legislation. On Feb. 17, the Swiss Financial Authority released a set of guidelines to help determine if an ICO and its tokens should be regulated under securities legislation. The US has yet to release a similar document.Two days ago, on Feb. 16, special assistant to the president and White House cybersecurity coordinator Rob Joyce told CNBC that general regulation of cryptocurrencies is something not yet “close,” as they were still in the “studying and understanding” stage of regulation.However, Reuters reports that US lawmakers are beginning to ask for legislation that would put digital currencies under SEC’s investor protection rules for securities, this new desire prompted by the steady growth of the crypto markets.Republican Representative Bill Huizenga, chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets - which will soon hold hearings on this topic - told Reuters that the “SEC is properly the lead on the issue.”Democrat Carolyn Maloney, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, agrees with Huizenga’s perspective that the SEC should be the regulatory crypto body, telling Reuters that, “a lot of people don’t realize there’s nothing backing these virtual currencies.”Even “free-marketer” Republicans like Dave Brat, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, are prepared to back regulatory legislation:“If it’s a currency that could destabilize the whole economy, you’re going to have that conversation.”In spite of this beginning of calls for regulation, lawmakers will still protect revolutionary technological innovations like Blockchain, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, told Reuters:“The goal here is to have rules of the road that protect consumers without trying to squash innovation.”",12,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #SEC    #CFTC    #Federal Reserve    #Cryptocurrencies    #ICO    #Government  
Croatia Launches Self-Regulating Blockchain Organization Amidst Growing Worldwide Trend,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/18/2018 16:47,28049,452,"Croatia’s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association (UBIK), is a self-regulatory organization registered Feb. 13 with the goal of creating a crypto community, educating the public, and developing regulation in Croatia. It has officially begun working yesterday, Feb. 17, according to the UBIK blog.The governing board of UBIK already met with the Central Office of Tax Administration in Croatia on Feb. 9 to discuss the issues covering the taxation of crypto as a capital gain, the regulations of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), and the business of crypto mining companies. The Croatian Bitcoin Portal writes that the members of the Tax Administration showed a willingness to openly engage with finding solutions to issues that fall under tax law.The idea behind UBIK was prompted by the rising use of Blockchain in both Croatia and across the globe. Its founding members are made up of a variety of Croatian Blockchain enthusiasts, including Blockchain developers, attorneys specializing in Blockchain, and authors of Blockchain-related books, the Croatian Bitcoin Portal writes.The Feb. 17 announcement reports that over 70 members have joined UBIK so far. Nikola Škori?, one of the organizers of UBIK, host of the Bitcoin Group Zagreb meetup, and founder of cryptocurrency brokerage service Electrocoin, said that he hopes to foster an environment for more Blockchain startups to base themselves out of Croatia, reports the Croatian newspaper Poslovni Dnevnik.The newspaper states that over 25,000 Croatians, out of a country of 4 mln, have invested in cryptocurrency. Škori? wants the next 20 Croatian ICOs to be based in Croatia, citing the example that Blockchain-based companies that the Zagreb Stock Exchange has a stake in need to use legal entities in Estonia, as opposed to Croatia, due to a lack of clear crypto legislature in the country.Škori? told Poslovni Dnevnik:“We want your startups to be registered as Croatian companies and that the capital collected comes directly to Croatia, to expand the database of experts who can work on this technology, to create a pool of knowledge and competence, [...] reinforcing the industries that work on the Blockchain.""Earlier this week, seven large cryptocurrency companies came together to form CryptoUK, a self-regulatory body within the United Kingdom crypto industry. CryptoUK will work with the UK on issues like preventing Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies from being used in money laundering and other illegal activities, but will not deal with ICO regulation.In Japan, the formation of a similar self-regulatory has been rumored, with the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) and the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) reportedly joining together this spring to act as a single body regarding regulations of crypto.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Croatia    #Government    #ICO

The court found that information on the website about digital currency Bitcoin, which represents a “virtual payment instrument and a store of value”, to violate the Federal Act “On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (the Bank of Russia)”.In July 2017, the Oktyabrsky District Court of St. Petersburg ordered to block 40 websites containing information about cryptocurrencies, claiming they “contribute to the growth of the shadow economy” and that free distribution of information about digital currency causes “high use of cryptocurrency in the trade of drugs, weapons, forged documents, and other criminal activity."" In March 2018, the St. Petersburg City Court reviewed the appeal and discharged the decision, ordering the websites to be unblocked.Earlier this week, the Russian government banned the popular messaging app Telegram. Communications watchdog Roskomnadzor attempted to enforce the ban by blocking nearly 20 mln IP addresses, but many users report that the app still functions.

MEPs Vote In Favor Of Tighter AML Regulations For Crypto Trading,Marie Huillet,4/20/2018 14:02,17474,93,"Members of the European Parliament have voted in favour of EU anti-money laundering reforms, which will include closer regulation for cryptocurrencies, by 574 votes to 13 votes, with 60 abstentions, according to an EUP press release April 19.The agreement, known colloquially as “5AMLD,” is the fifth update to the EU’s anti-money laundering directive. It comes in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 2015 and 2016 in Paris and Brussels, as well as the Panama Papers leaks, the press release noted.The new reforms strengthen transparency rules to prevent the large-scale concealment of funds, with specific stipulations to address risks associated with cryptocurrencies. 5AMLD requires crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers to apply customer due diligence controls, to be registered, and also puts pressure on trusts and trading companies to reveal holders of virtual currency.The press release underscores that the reforms are a bid to stamp out anonymity in the crypto trading sphere. MEP Krišj?nis Kari?š commented:“Criminals use anonymity to launder their illicit proceeds or finance terrorism. This legislation helps address the threats to our citizens and the financial sector by allowing greater access to the information about the people behind firms and by tightening rules regulating virtual currencies.”More broadly, the reforms grant the right of access to data on beneficial owners of firms, trusts, and similar arrangements to anyone who can demonstrate a “legitimate interest,” including citizens, investigative journalists and NGOs. Alongside data transparency laws, 5AMLD proposes toughened measures against tax evasion.EU member states will now have 18 months to transpose the updated directive into national law.In January, Cointelegraph ran an expert take, evaluating the EU’s ongoing revisions of AML legislation for crypto trading within an international context.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Law    #Money Laundering    #AML

French Legislators Hold Hearing on Bitcoin,Eric Barrier,1/16/2014 12:13,52,0,"Representatives from the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency economies presented their cases before the French Senate.The hearing, chaired by Philippe Marini — whose other functions include membership in a joint fact-finding mission with the EU to determine government roles on the Internet — featured representatives from the Bank of France, the French Ministry of Finance’s money-laundering department, and many others.Gonzague Grandval, whose company Paymium operates a Eurozone Bitcoin exchange and payment processor, spoke on behalf of Bitcoin.As with the hearings that have taken place in senates and parliaments around the world, the ostensible purpose was to determine what risks unregulated digital currencies presented.Here are the highlights from the hearing, as translated on Reddit by /u/mmitech, /u/Schlagv and /u/bitcoin-artist:This hearing’s outcome paralleled to a large degree the hearings held in Washington last fall in that officials concluded they would simply be keeping an eye on things.Much of the confusion and hesitation may simply stem from a lack of understanding on the part of lawmakers, as noted in the Reddit threat when it became clear senators could not grasp fully the idea of a decentralized currency.Perhaps governments have realized they cannot make pronouncements on technology too early on without conjuring up “a series of tubes” memes and undermining credibility.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #France  
IRS: give U.S. taxpayers their law!,Cointelegraph,1/13/2014 12:23,41,0,"Assault on the Internal Revenue Service continues. Now it is Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate. In annual report for 2013, presented to Congress she states that to this moment IRS was not able to anyhow clear the rules regarding Bitcoin with its lightning fast spread across the international market and how it must be treated according to the tax laws.Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS), which Olson is a head of, takes upon the roles of unbiased spectator, advisor and taxpayers’ representative for IRS due to TAS being an independent institution within it. That way all the taxpayers’ confusion and anger are channeled from TAS directly to IRS.National Taxpayer Advocate believes that all law-abiding entrepreneurs with businesses that are somehow entangled with digital currency want to play it by the book, but not exactly know how to do it. In her opinion, what also concerns these people is that they could be associated with some criminal activity, because IRS did not proclaimed any official regulation over Bitcoin.There are several topics that Olson wants to point out.Main issue is the state tax law that in her opinion will be the hardest riddle to work out. Currently, some states have a law according to which, sellers that are not located in a given state must provide only full sales tax collection if the seller has information about the buyers address. And as we know, the bitcoin transactions themselves do not provide such info.Another thing that occupies Olson is that bitcoin traders may fail to comply with the Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report which according to Wikipedia means that:“Each person (including a bank) subject to the jurisdiction of the United States having an interest in, signature or other authority over, one or more bank, securities, or other financial accounts in a foreign country must file an FBAR if the aggregate value of such accounts at any point in a calendar year exceeds $10,000.[4]""In short the idea is: if you are a US citizen or resident, you have to inform about your accounts outside the States that hold more than ten thousand dollars.Olson received support from Senator Tom Carper, who mirrored her opinion on Bitcoin using taxpayers and disapproved the IRS’s inactivity on the concerning matter. Though he was optimistic about the new Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, hoping that John Koskinen “takes these recommendations to heart and acts expeditiously to provide thoughtful guidance to taxpayers regarding the use of digital currencies”.It has to be mentioned that in 2009 IRS has already published information on the tax compliance risk form virtual economies (including the tax implications of virtual economy transactions) in 2007, even before Olson asked for their assistance on taxes. However, at that time Bitcoin, the father of all cryptocurrencies was still but a shadow of what it is today, an idea thrown into the vasts of internet by a user under a name of Saotshi Nakamoto.So, if You are a U.S. citizen that has or has interest in working with bitcoins follow the news, something is stirring up here and You don’t want to cross the law, do you?

Bitcoin Legal Status Mirrored on a Political Map While Being Called Speculative,Andrew Marshall,1/13/2014 12:17,117,0,"CoinMap is a great invention of the Bitcoin environment allowing determining merchants and vendors accepting the coin for any kind of goods and services. As different jurisdictions and countries were voicing their opinions and issuing warnings on the virtual currencies during the past several months, a young developer has decided to sum graphically up their words and provide startups and entrepreneurs with relevant information on the current weather on one or another market.Zachary Taylor from Philadelphia was thinking about normalizing the existing official statements and positions of the governments to get an image on the present global situation. He has taken the political map of the world and colored countries in dependence of their mood in questions of Bitcoin and its application. The categories he received to group the countries are following – permissive (green), contentious (yellow), hostile (red), unknown (grey). The project is named BitLegal.net, which was firstly presented on Reddit to most advanced users and activists. The result and feedback got is very positive and encouraged the developer to make future contributions to the idea. Of course, the political environment might change, so the key feature of success will be its simultaneous updates of statuses and even provision of additional information. The statuses are awarded in accordance with comments received from authorities, financial institutions of all levels, separate experts, governments and official organizations.At time of the launch of the service several countries have issued more statements on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Some of them can be considered as elaborations to pervious issues, but some are determining the situations on the highest level.The most detailed information is received from Germany. The country was one of the first to study the matter and to accept the coin without any strong prohibitions. During the previous week Carl-Ludwig Thiele, the Bundesbank board member, allowed himself to publish a warning about the coin. Several sources are citing his statement as “Bitcoins remain highly speculative, as they are as volatile as ever”. He names volatility of the currency as the main reason for speculatively actions and other violations that might lead to losses of funds for both organizations and private users. Mr. Thiele also points out that there are no regulations or responsive institution that might protect the investors in case of problems and uncertainty.Belgium has also decided to clarify its position. After some news on new services and collaboration with a Dutch exchanger, the society has been shaken with the National Bank’s comment. The institution is going to reject further attempts to regulate the Bitcoin network, but it does not mean that in the closest future this strategy might change and some regulations will be implemented.Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Caejer Chan Ka-keung, has been one of the harshest authorities to speak on the virtual currency this week. He, as Mr. Thiele, describes the coin as a speculative matter and also sees many risks around it. He cannot understand the reasons of the high price, as no economic proven force is behind the formation of the value. He foresees possible fluctuations that might bring to losses for people investing, trading and using the digital currency.The French Senate’s Finance Committee has gone even further, scheduling on the 15th January a session “on issues related to the development of virtual currencies like Bitcoin”. Some speakers to take part will be Delphine Amarzit, from the Treasury Department; Denis Beau, chief operating officer at the Bank of France; Jean-Baptiste Carpentier, TRACFIN’s director; Jean-Michel Cornu, scientific director of the Next Generation Internet Foundation; Jean-Paul Garcia, national director of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation entity (DNRED); and M. Grandval Gonzaga, president of PAYMIUM SAS and several other specialists of the branch.However, the high value of Zachary Taylor’s invention is not decreasing from any kind of critics on the Bitcoin. The warnings might continue to pop up, but the technological process is unstoppable and undeniable.

FinCEN not requiring individual Bitcoin miners to register,Eric Barrier,12/30/2013 13:01,122,0,"Some good news came out of the US Treasury Department for American Bitcoin miners.Anyone mining Bitcoins for his or her own purposes and not for the benefit of others will not be consider a money services business and will thus have no obligation to register with FinCEN, according to a ruling by the group.FinCEN, or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, has thus far required any US-based Bitcoin business to register as money transmitters.But if you are mining Bitcoins simply for your own digital currency wealth and spending those earnings for your sole benefit, then you don’t fall under FinCEN’s definition of a money services business.This is good news for a number of miners who were concerned they would have to comply with a number of difficult federal regulations just to run their mining equipment.The ruling is the result of a request from Atlantic City Bitcoin, a New Jersey-based company that operates a number of ASIC miners. FinCEN replied to Atlantic City Bitcoin as follows:“To the extent that a user mines Bitcoin and uses the Bitcoin solely for the user’s own purposes and not for the benefit of another, the user is not an MSB under FinCEN’s regulations, because these activities involve neither ‘acceptance’ nor ‘transmission’ of the convertible virtual currency and are not the transmission of funds within the meaning of the Rule.“This is the case whether the user mining and using the Bitcoin is an individual or a corporation, and whether the user is purchasing goods or services for the user’s own use, paying debts previously incurred in the ordinary course of business, or (in the case of a corporate user) making distributions to shareholders.”Note that any contract mining operations done on behalf of another would not qualify and thus would have to register as a money services business.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #FinCEN    #Bitcoin Mining    #USA  
China Continues the Strife with Bitcoin Harming the Crypto Environment,Cointelegraph,12/17/2013 20:54,62,0,"According to reliable and trustworthy source the Chinese authorities and the People’s Bank of China has continued the warfare against bitcoin and other crypto currencies. The recent warning was given to the third-party payment companies. According to the Central Bank they should terminate and not be engaged in actions with bitcoins or servicing virtual coin users. It means that the bank prohibits the companies to work with bitcoin exchange services. While this statement remained a proven rumor the price of the digital coin has dropped by around 200 dollars and was unable to gain a higher position after the official confirmations from several firms.The theme was touched by the representatives of the People’s Bank of China during a meeting with the third-party payment companies. The main topic of the conversation was not relayed to bitcoin, but became crucial for it. The reliable source noted that the new advice that has to obeyed considers future deals. The deposit of new funds is becoming impossible, but the withdrawal remains safe.The warnings first occurred on the 5th December, but were interpreted in a more positive way by experts. Same happy mood was picked up on the “Inside Bitcoin” conference in Las Vegas last week. The ban also means that merchants will not be able to accept the coin for their products and services, but the users should not hurry to their banks – the possibility to collect the money will be opened for a while. Still the citizens are allowed to buy and sell coins and new exchanges can be registered at the ministry of information and industrial technology. The optimists of the virtual society understand it as a positive trend – there is some legitimate opinion on the currency, but the official financial institutions stay outside.It is a pity that this opinion is not shared by everyone. The BTC China and other exchange service have already reintroduced fees for users that do not become evidence of the forecasted blossom.Today, on the 17th December several companies participating in the meeting have approved the rumors of yesterday. PayPal, Alipay, TenPay all confirmed the news. This all provided a drop of price of the bitcoin equal to 200 dollars. From $876 the price went down to $645, experienced a small rise up to $771 to make a second decrease. The final loss was equal to 22%. It is not a surprise as China was forecasted as the biggest player on the bitcoin market. The reasons were simple – the emerging and developing economy, huge population, interest in modern technologies. The Yan even out powered the Dollar as determining pair for BTC. Jaron Lukasiewicz agrees that current event will impact the price for a long time in future. Just three days ago some users reported rapid transactions from banks, like China Merchants Bank, for funding a bitcoin account. Now a common result for similar action is an error or termination of request.At present time the community is awaiting an official comment or statement published by the People’s Bank of China. Their revelation will be the determining position for other banks of the country. Some information sources from China operating a bitcoin service, believe that nothing more can or has to be done by the authorities to reduce interest of the residents in the crypto currency. The situation is similar to US-based poker–platforms – the government prohibited financial institutions for holding the funds and the idea collapsed. The same is being performed in China – there is no official ban, but the users due to limitation are unable to function in the coin community. The Chinese Dragon has closed its jaws around the virtual coin, who will definitely seek for a method to release itself to gain more power to return to the market in the closest future.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China  
Bitcoin’s status in Germany,Eric Barrier,12/5/2013 17:30,54,0,"Back in August, Germany became the first country in the world to recognize Bitcoin as “private money.” Note this is not the same as legal tender.This, perhaps above all, is seen as legitimizing Bitcoin’s image worldwide, where prevailing narratives before mid-2013 or so focused on Silk Road and money launderers.In Germany itself, Bitcoin spenders and businesspeople are now free to engage in digital commerce without the fear that their activities put them on the wrong side of the law.But this designation has further implications in Germany and Europe. First, the currency’s decentralized structure means governments cannot simply seize a citizen’s Bitcoins or take a percentage of someone’s deposits, as we saw happen in Cyprus. With prolonged concerns about the euro itself, many in Germany and Europe see Bitcoins as a way to diversify holdings and hedge against EU policies.Some in Germany argue that currency competition is a good thing.“A free country should resist and not intervene in citizen’s private choice of money,” said Frank Schaeffler, member of the German parliament’s finance committee. “In my opinion, the production of money is none of the government’s business.”Note, though, that all Germany really did was classify Bitcoin and find a place in its legal code for digital currencies. This same law covers any privately agreed-upon form of payment that could be used in multilateral clearing or settlement.That said, Germany still feels it has the right to tax Bitcoin. According to Berlin, everyday commercial transaction in Germany in Bitcoin still falls under the tax regime.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Germany  
Official Statement of the Representative of the China Central Bank on Bitcoin,NikHom,11/22/2013 8:35,46,0,"As already was published during the previous month, bitcoin has taken a huge interest for itself in China. It is not a secret that there are very many users of the crypto currency located in China, there are even lots of miners. The leading exchange service is as well located in the republic. Many others have emerged during the present year. However, the legality of the matter – buying, selling, receiving and sending of bitcoin was questioned to be legal. Many members of the virtual community were not sure to be able to leave the underground.The position of the key person of the economics of China has dropped the ban for the perspective digital currency. Yi Gang, being the deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China has given his attitude, which is the governmental position on bitcoin.He has voice his opinion during the Chinese economic forum. After his beliefs the central bank is not going to recognize the currency as an official method of exchange, but sees possible progress in future. Let us describe it as – possible more positive changes in attitude might soon appear. Also he is sure that the government is not going to prevent people from entering the community of bitcoin and processing deals and other actions considering the crypto currency.The CEO of BTC China Bobby Lee says that this is very much for an official statement, nothing more could be said for now. It means no official status will be awarded to the coin, but it is not prohibited by the government and authorities. He even thinks that it is the great positive advertising opportunity for bitcoin, when such an important official allows himself to speak about it in public in a favorable manner.As was mentioned in some of other publications on our homepage the price for a BTC goes fluently up. In China it has reached an all-time peak of 1120 dollars for a single BTC, it is even more than currently in the USA.Experts were surprised that this open discussion on the coin did not lead to the next increase of price. It seems that the masses are still unaware of the currency. Observing the global situation no other government is ready to accept bitcoin and the existing role of it. It sure is something special, as history has not seen something similar before. It seems surprising that many private financial institutions prefer to fight against it. Some even terminate accounts belonging to people active in the bitcoin branch, committing payments and being merchants is seen as a crime.Some steps are made towards bitcoin by the authorities in the US – too many people are engaged in the system. But observing China the activity is still to poor. The CCTV 2 has shown a movie about bitcoin, many physical vendors accept it as a payment method, and huge corporations like manufacturers of semiconductors also accept the coins.It is sure that that other economies, even very advanced, should learn to use the profits offered by the digital finance as China does.

The article mentions a convention that was the first official met up to feature the questions about bitcoin. The matter of this summit is very important from almost all points of view, as it is a reason for a healthy future of the society.On 13th June of the year 2013 in the Carlucci Auditorium in Washington was held a panel. The venue belongs to the US institute of Peace. The two main sponsors of this year conference were Thompson Reuters and the Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. I suppose You can imagine that this was not the most favorable topic to start the discussion about the features and advantages of the coin.The second part of the panel was devoted to the question of children pornography and its purchase, as well with bitcoins and its network. The representative of the Justice department of the USA voice the opinion that virtual coins stimulated the creation of bigger amount of materials consisting or holding trace of children pornography. It means that encouraging the “mining” of coins is encouraging the criminals.The lead developer of Bitcoin community Patrick Murck, along with Gavin Andressen refused to see some link, because the bitcoin as a currency in this chain can be easily replaced by other payment methods. The decentralization and no governance of the bitcoin environment is not the key factor to prefer the currency by criminals. There are many other types of money that also can stimulate the activity on the black market.On this panel was for the first time claimed the will of the BTC community to enter the new age, where some level of regulation is established. The level should not exceed the main principles of the currency, to keep its progressive approach to economics. Both developers offered to hold separate from other questions panels and seminars, open, shown in public to discuss all questions and to reduce the doubts.As many experts believe this first meeting even on a event considering totally different questions has led to a beginning of the conversation between the BTC world and the authorities. In this conversation the representatives of the bitcoin are not seen as criminals, but as respected members of the US society that really have something to present and to protect – the right for liberty. ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Washington    #Decentralization    #USA  
Bitcoin’s increasing legitimacy sparks rally on exchanges,Eric Barrier,11/19/2013 20:10,57,0,"Bitcoin traders were waiting to hear just the words Department of Justice representatives offered up.When the DOJ told a Senate committee that Bitcoin constitutes a “legal means of exchanges,” prices surged. One BTC commanded $744 on the Bitstamp exchange, and prices flirted with the $900 mark on Mt. Gox.Bitcoin prices have increased more than 40-fold this year.Much of that has been brought on by an increasing level of interest from China, where a liquid, unregulated currency is seen as an attractive investment by citizens who have trouble even getting their national currency across the border. A third of all Bitcoin trades take place in China, and the country is home to the world’s largest exchange by volume and user base, BTC China.In fact, as the Senate heard testimony, BTC China was securing a $2 million round of Series A funding.Meanwhile, US officials were busy discussing law enforcement issues.""We all recognize that virtual currencies, in and of themselves, are not illegal,"" said Mythili Raman, from the Department of Justice. ""We are nimble enough and aggressive enough to be able to combat the threat.”Speculation has driven much of the currency’s value, as well, said Exante Ltd. co-founder Vladimir Maslyakov, whose company has established an investment fund with Bitcoins. Maslyakov’s fund holds some 60,000 Bitcoins and is awaiting a green light from federal regulators to seek investors.Bitcoin Foundation representative Patrick Murck warned that things are still not yet stable. “It’s very much an experimental currency and should be considered a high-risk environment,” he said.Still, the currency has begun to attract big-name investors.The Winklevoss twins, for example, hold about 100,000 Bitcoins and are very publicly bullish on the currency.SecondMarket Inc. CEO Barry Silbert said investors are using the currency to diversify their holdings. His company allows investors to trade private company shares.“We are now seeing the principals of Wall Street firms and funds investing their own funds into Bitcoin,” Silbert said.Before wider adoption is possible, though, the currency needs to stabilize, say analysts. Wild swings such as the one right after the Senate hearing are a double-edged sword.But the tepid votes of confidence before Congress are a step in that direction. Bitcoin is making inroads into the mainstream. Recently, one pool table manufacturer installed a Bitcoin payment processor in its pool tables for players who have run out of quarters.And up in Vancouver, the first Bitcoin ATM was installed at a local coffee shop.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Barry Silbert  
Is Bitcoin outgrowing its core user base?,Eric Barrier,11/19/2013 16:35,43,0,"Charles Sizemore, owner and manager of client accounts at Sizemore Capital Management, writes on Forbes.com that the Senate’s accepting of Bitcoin’s legitimacy undercuts half of the currency’s appeal in the eyes of some in the community.This is in reference to a Senate Hearing committee on November 18 in which the Justice Department and the SEC acknowledged that Bitcoin is in fact a legitimate form of currency.Among the hardcore libertarians who first adopted Bitcoin, this sounds like the first steps of a currency’s co-option, Sizemore suggests.But he insists on not getting too far ahead of our selves. Bitcoin hasn’t come of age, nor has it become a permanent feature in the mainstream.In fact, he suggests no one put any money in Bitcoin that cannot afford to lose, because precedent exists that the currency can lose a majority share of its value in one fell swoop. Furthermore, Sizemore says the arguments in favor of Bitcoin are “flawed.”First, he suggests that if investors were actually worried about currency devaluation, they would be buying gold and raising its price, which is not happening. This refers to Bitcoin’s being unregulated by any centralized institutions, a key features for many users.Gold and other precious metals have been diving since October 2012. Gold, silver and platinum have all seen price drops of 30%, 40% and 20%, respectively.Sizemore says a safer investment is something that allows the owner to collect interest or rent, such as real estate. Then, in a nod to doomsday speculators (many of whom are in the gold market), if governments were to collapse and society were to quickly crumble, he has a nice line: “The only currency that would have any value would be shotgun shells.”But the point he is making is that Bitcoin’s rise has nothing to do with currency debasement or investors looking to safeguard their money outside traditional monetary systems. Fair enough.Sizemore’s second argument, though, suggests a fundamental misunderstanding on his part. He argues that Bitcoin supports are putting “faith in an algorithm,” as if numbers require belief to make them work. Then he trots out a couple of recent examples of Bitcoin theft because, you know, people stealing money makes the money itself unreliable.Sizemore’s suggestion is to treat Bitcoin as a speculation bubble and only gamble with money you can lose. Sound advice for short-term investors and the get-rich-quick folks. But his column misses the larger point of Bitcoin as a platform, as others have done in this space on Forbes.com.Which gets back to the point of the Senate hearings and early Bitcoin adopters. With outside interests viewing the currency as either a law enforcement problem or a speculation bubble, the hardcore set of users who want nothing to do with government compliance and mainstream use are validated somewhat.All of these criticisms read like the complaints of a huge group of people who crashed a loft party uninvited then decided that the party kind of sucked.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation  
The case for regulation,Eric Barrier,11/19/2013 15:05,67,0,"Daniel Cawrey at CoinDesk broke down a few arguments for why government regulation on some level would be a benefit to Bitcoin.This has been a hot topic in the US since the November 18 Senate committee hearing on digital currencies.The basis for regulation, in his argument, comes from FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery’s quote about mitigate risk while minimizing the burder on the currency.Cawrey touches on three areas of concern: Crime, privacy and the banks. Here is how limited regulation could assuage those concerns.First, the FBI and the DOJ acknowledged that Bitcoin itself is not unlawful, merely a convenient tool for criminals. Sites such as Silk Road and Assassination Market cannot exist without Bitcoin or some other digital currency, so the currency has to fall within the sphere of law enforcement’s interests.But Bitcoin as a means of payment is not enough to facilitate crime. That’s where anonymity, or at least pseudonymity, comes in.While US officials, ahem, concede a right to privacy, this right should not provide a mask for anyone who would, say, distribute child pornography.The idea that banks are also underserving the needs of people in the mainstream economy was brought up by Circle found Jeremy Allaire. If Bitcoin can address those inefficiencies and provide banking to the underserved (or those simply unhappy with their banks), it would remove the current burden of “cumbersome and inefficient” payment systems.Fair points, all, but two problems immediately jump out.One, do we trust a government like the one in the United States to regulate a digital currency. We know how the US feels about privacy, as their actions have revealed. Lip service to privacy is straight up untrustworthy.Second, how might the US try to claim jurisdiction over an international currency? Who is the US to impose anything on the rest of the world? ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #FinCEN    #Circle  
"Bitcoin called ‘legitimate’ in Senate, soars in value",Eric Barrier,11/19/2013 12:50,89,0,"In a letter released a day before a Senate committee hearing on Bitcoin, the FBI recognized the digital currency as offering “legitimate financial services,” though it warned criminals and those with malicious intent could exploit the currency.Still, it was a sufficient vote of confidence to send Bitcoin prices to new record highs. The Mt. Gox exchange briefly saw trades of 1 BTC for 900 USD before the price stabilized. The asking price just three weeks earlier had been around $200.The hearing was called by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to determine the risks and potential of Bitcoin for both government and society.The US Senate called for the hearing after the anything-goes online marketplace Silk Road was closed in October. The FBI shut it down because drugs, illegal goods and illegal services were being sold for Bitcoins.Many US officials expressed great concern over what criminal behavior Bitcoin could enable. The Justice Department’s Mythili Raman said her organization has seen “increasing use of such currencies by drug dealers, traffickers of child pornography, and perpetrators of large-scale fraud schemes.”Still, mainstream audiences can’t help but get interested in a currency with a value that has grown in leaps and bounds this fall.George Mason University researcher Jerry Brito said, “Congress has been education itself and understands that there are great potential benefits, and like any new technology there are going to be some challenges.”The question is where to strike a balance between letting the currency proliferate organically in the US and trying to regulate it. Perhaps counterintuitively, interest from regulators increases the value of a currency designed to be unregulated and decentralized.An official from the Dutch Rabobank, which previously forbade customers from using Bitcoins, supported regulation and said “decisions taken now could have wider repercussions were such virtual currency experiments to be expanded in the future.”Others strictly focused on the use of the currency by criminals.Patrick Murck from the Bitcoin Foundation argued that by design it is not a good match for criminals or illegitimate users. He said the foundations finds that there are fare more legitimate users than those who would seek refuge for their schemes behind the currency’s anonymity.Brito put a big-picture perspective on the hearings, saying that this level of recognition means the currency is finally “coming into its own.” He said Bitcoin is real and is here to stay.It’s up to governments and everyone else to catch up. ",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Rabobank    #FBI    #USA  
Another take on the Senate Bitcoin hearing,Eric Barrier,11/19/2013 12:10,78,0,"Danny Bradbury at CoinDesk reports an ominous tone from Washington.“Don’t bother running from regulation … because in the long term there’s nowhere to hide,” he writes.Bradbury was covering the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs committee hearing on Bitcoin and other digital currencies.Full video of the hearing is available at:www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/beyond-silk-road-potential-risks-threats-and-promises-of-virtual-currencies.Bradbury reports that FinCEN Director Jennier Shasky Calvery warned companies taking their business offshore would only lead to short-term gains. The idea is that Bitcoin businesses trying to get out from under US regulation are only hurting themselves in the long run.That sounds like a lot of bluster, though, when you consider how well Bitcoin businesses are doing in China, as an example.“Every country has an interest in protecting its financial system from illicit actors,” she said, calling out money launderers, terrorism financiers and fraudsters.Collecting taxes and keeping the economy stable is part of the government’s job, she said. And regulation “both at home and abroad” is going to catch up because it must.Jerry Brito, a researcher from George Mason University, another witness at the hearing, criticized Calvery’s remarks.The real problem, he said, is not criminals but law-abiding businesses, innovators and entrepreneurs who feel stifled by the US’s regulatory environment.Brito has argued in the Guardian newspaper that such a stifling environment is already in place, though this is not necessarily intentional.Simply not knowing what state and federal compliance regulations apply to a business have had a chilling effect on development. Just ask Jaron Lukasiewicz, whose legitimate, malicious intent-free New York-based startup, Coinsetter, has had to all but bend over backward to stay on the good side of the law.Calvery suggested Bitcoin businesses in the US do three things immediately: register with FinCEN, adopt strong AML practices, and maintain records and report to FinCEN — especially report suspicious activity.Calvery said businesses based around fiat currencies have all found ways to do this, so digital currencies should be able to do the same.The FBI and other agencies are on record as saying Bitcoin is a “legitimate” currency. Calvery’s tie-in with fiat currencies there makes you wonder exactly how Washington will try to define “legitimate.”US officials might not yet totally get it — they might not yet grasp Bitcoin’s protocols or its value as a platform.CoinDesk commenters spotted this quickly. Said user Rod: “Bottom line, their paradigm is collapsing but they can’t even see it.” ",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #FinCEN  
Japan: Registered Crypto Exchanges Join Forces To Self-Regulate Local Market,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/3/2018 12:44,23304,395,"Two trade groups in Japan’s cryptocurrency industry have agreed to form an as-of-yet unnamed organization next month that will self regulate the local crypto market in conjunction with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), local news outlet Nikkei Asian Review reports Saturday, March 3.This cooperation in the Japanese crypto sphere comes after January’s hack of the Japanese-based crypto exchange Coincheck, with losses totalling more than $534 mln in NEM, the largest hack in the crypto world since Mt. Gox. The hack, which was caused by a breach of a low security hot wallet storing NEM, prompted the FSA to conduct security measure inspections on 15 unregistered crypto exchanges, including Coincheck.The trade groups looking to self-regulate, one of which is the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA),  represent 16 registered crypto market operators. The market operators  will reportedly work together to produce industry-wide investor safety standards, including the creation of guidelines for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). The Nikkei Asian review writes that the group will be able to require compliance of its members, similar to the powers held by the Japan Securities Dealers Association.Taizen Okuyama, president of foreign exchange trading platform Money Partners Group, as well as chair of the JCBA, will serve as chairman of the new organization. Okuyama told the Nikkei Asian Review that the aim of this new organization is to “bring the entire cryptocurrency sector to bear on self-regulation.”Yuzo Kano, the CEO of Tokyo-based exchange bitFlyer and head of the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA), will serve as vice chairman.If the new group is approved as an independent regulatory body by the government, the organization will be able to prohibit certain virtual currencies from being used by registered crypto operators in the country if, for example, the coins are suspected of being used in money laundering, the Nikkei Asian Review reports. While waiting for FSA approval, the new regulatory body will be provisionally open to registered operators and exchanges.In mid-February, seven large cryptocurrencies companies joined together to create CryptoUK, the first trade organization that will self-regulate the crypto market within the United Kingdom.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Coincheck    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Cryptocurrencies    #ICO    #BitFlyer    #Government    #United Kingdom  
Senate recognizes legitimate benefits of Bitcoin,Eric Barrier,11/18/2013 16:45,60,0,"Both the DOJ and the SEC have told a US Senate committee hearing that Bitcoin represents a legitimate financial instrument, delighting investors and speculators at the idea of wider acceptance from the mainstream.Their comments came ahead of a hearing called by the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to look into the potential of digital currencies, and the risks they may pose.This just a month after the FBI shut down the Silk Road, an unregulated online marketplace that become the go-to website for anyone seeking mail-order drugs. Silk Road payments were made in Bitcoin, and it’s stories like these that have given digital currencies a bad name for some.Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik wrote that digital currencies behave like other financial services, which are also used by criminals and “malicious actors.” The difference is Bitcoin is decentralized, transnational and much harder to regulate.Mary Jo White, chairwoman of the SEC, suggested Bitcoin would be considered securities by their definition and thus subject to SEC regulation.What has many officials spooked is the fact that the currencies are designed to be untraceable, allowing anonymous transactions on the web. Privacy advocates see that as a positive, but law enforcement officials want to know what everyone’s hiding here.Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed was not planning to attempt to regulate Bitcoin. Bernanke said the Fed lacks the “authority to directly supervise or regulate these innovations or the entities that provide them to market,” he wrote to the committee.Bitcoin researcher Jerry Brito sees these hearings as a sign that Bitcoin “is coming into its own,” and is starting to gain traction across much of society.This would be a boon to the currency, which has seen its value driven up in some part when investors believe acceptance and legitimacy move forward. A large faction of Bitcoin users seek cooperation with regulators so Bitcoin businesses can grow and proliferate without any clampdowns from governments.To this point in the US, Washington’s stance has been unclear, and this has cooled innovation, moving developments and exchanges offshore. China currently sees 35% of all Bitcoin transaction activity and is home to the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, BTC China.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #USA    #SEC  
Bitcoin’s value rises further after Senate hearing,Eric Barrier,11/18/2013 15:10,99,0,"Washington inadvertently gave a big boost to the very currency they are concerned with.After the first of two Senate hearings concluded on November 18, Bitcoin began trading at highs above the $750 mark. This come, however, after the value dipped to $600 at the beginning of the hearing.Two phrases seemed to be investors’ big takeaways from this hearing. First, the committee acknowledged Bitcoin as a “legal means of exchange.” Washington up until then hadn’t been so forthcoming with its thoughts on the currency.Second, Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman said, “We all recognize that virtual currencies, in and of themselves, are not illegal.”Maybe it is not a stamp of approval, but it’s close enough for now. Many in the Bitcoin community are seeking legitimacy from governments, banks and major industry players, as wider acceptance, it is believed, will add value to the currency both intrinsically and as a platform.Statements of trust calm banks and investors.Barry Silbert, of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which holds about 53,000 Bitcoins, said that the government is being careful to be thoughtful and balanced in its approach to digital currencies and their regulation.This is also finally some good news for a country that has seen many of its homegrown innovations in the industry sent overseas due to unintentionally stifling regulations.One big concern Washington has deals with crime. Specifically, how can it combat any drug running, money laundering and terrorism financed by a decentralized and unregulated currency? There may simply exist some incompatibility between nations and Bitcoins.Interestingly enough, all this government interest has shone a spotlight on Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, and this might be driving awareness and inflating the value.""If investors feel that Bitcoin is truly legitimate but foresee supply constraints due to exchanges closing or new regulations hitting the market, there is a sense of urgency developing to obtain bitcoins now, ‘while you can,’"" said Christopher Vecchio, an analyst at DailyFX.Silbert, whose fund launched in September, remains bullish about the long-term prospects for Bitcoin. He said that while the quick price moves make people uncomfortable at first, each bubble’s bust finds a new price floor.The message seemed to be “one step at a time.”Occasionally, though, giant leaps may occur.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #Washington    #Barry Silbert  
Regulation: It’s Coming,Eric Barrier,11/18/2013 14:05,116,0,"CoinDesk’s Danny Bradbury asks an important question in light of the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’ hearing on Bitcoin: Is all of this even necessary?It’s certainly a fair question. What is an institution of centralized control going to do with/for a decentralized currency? Bitcoin is incompatible and doesn’t need your concern, Washington. Thanks anyway.Still, Bitcoin proponents like Jeremy Allaire, founder of Circle, have gone to Congress to help politicians and officials wrap their heads around what’s been going on.Allaire himself has called it “short-sighted” that members of the Bitcoin community want to keep the currency a niche instruments for circumventing policies and regulations.Jerry Brito, a Bitcoin researcher at George Mason University, also spoke before the committee, and he agrees with Allaire’s sentiment.Regulators gonna regulate.Brito’s argument is that the currency itself cannot be controlled — at least not easily — but government regulations can hamper innovation and entrepreneurship.In a Guardian op-ed, Brito states that regulators are already stifling innovation and growth. Bitcoin innovation is taking place in other countries.Therefore, he said it is up to Bitcoin community members in the US to educate the government about what is going on so regulation does not get in the way of a Bitcoin infrastructure that could be built there.“If it’s going to happen anyway,” Brito said, “what’s the harm in being there to present a rational and reasonable perspective?”And perspective is a good idea to present to a government that tends to view new things first through the prism of law enforcement. The hearing itself was called only after the FBI shut down the Silk Road. To many, Bitcoin equals the online trafficking in drugs or child pornography or weapons that go to the Terrorists™.Bradbury suggests this is an old issue. What’s more important, allowing technology to flourish or the fact that said technology could enable criminals?Some are trying to reach a middle ground by keeping the technology but pulling back the cloak of anonymity that has many hands wringing. Options presented included marking Bitcoins that have been used to possibly fund unsavory activities.The Bitcoin Foundation, though, did not support that idea.All these arguments are playing out in the Bitcoin community, as well. Some members want to cooperate with regulators; others shun the entire on principle.Either way, Bitcoin will continue to flourish. It just remains to be seen whether steps taken by the US can allow it to grow in that country, or whether innovators and infrastructure builders will simply go elsewhere.Image source:siliconrus.com ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Homeland Security    #USA  
US government slowly showing its stance on Bitcoin,Eric Barrier,11/16/2013 12:30,47,0,"With US Senate hearings set for November 18 and 19, a subcommittee has released answers into questions it submitted back in August regarding virtual currencies.These letters offer the best glimpse yet into what the US government thinks about Bitcoin and how the various agencies are regarding digital currencies.The questions, from the Senate’s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, went out to five different agencies to see how they were dealing with what they called “virtual currencies.”The released answers come from Homeland Security, the DOJ, the Fed, the SEC and the Treasury Department.All five have expressed a real interest in digital currencies, but each seems to be viewing activity from the lens of law enforcement; namely, what to do about terrorists and money launderers?This focus on crime is illustrative and may hint at the US government’s collective attitude. Only the Fed and the Treasury Department suggested that digital currencies could be beneficial and more efficient.Homeland Security seems to view digital currencies through a prism of, well, national security. Its response mentioned a need for an “aggressive posture” toward the currencies and a “multi-prong strategy” when targeting digital currency exchanges and platforms. Its primary worries were international organized crime’s ability to move money overseas quickly and anonymously.The DOJ recognized that decentralized payment systems offered legitimate benefits but worried about money laundering. It appears to be monitoring developments closely through working groups and “intelligence products.”The Fed suggests such currencies hold “long-term promise” as faster, more secure, more efficient payment systems. It also mentioned it lacks any regulatory authority but must be contacted in the event that “special measures” regarding digital currencies are under consideration.The SEC asserted some authority over virtual currencies insofar that entities issuing interests or providing returns on digital currencies fall under its definition of securities. The SEC also mentioned that informational talks had been held with the Bitcoin Foundation.The Treasury admitted to following digital currencies closely and echoed the Fed’s admission that such currencies provide legitimate financial services, but it also worries that digital currencies can be exploited by terrorists and money launderers. That activity has thus far been limited, though, by “scope, liquidity and volatility.”Watch this space for updates from the Committee’s hearings.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #US Government    #SEC  
On the State of New York’s ‘BitLicenses’,Darya Alyokhina,11/14/2013 13:05,89,0,"In mid-November, the New York State Department of Financial Services announced in a release that it was going to hold a public inquiry into digital currencies and that it was considering licensing requirements for Bitcoin businesses in the Empire State.They were the ones who coined the term “BitLicenses,” here.This moves comes a few months after the state subpoenaed 22 Bitcoin businesses to ask them about how, exactly, they were operating. These companies included Coinsetter, Coinbase and Winklevoss Capital Management.Patrick Murck, from the Bitcoin Foundation, said at the time, “The requests are onerous and set a poor tone for New York as a home of innovation.”Being unwelcome to innovation is one thing. But let’s be clear: These are power plays, however clumsy, by the State of New York.New York City is the center of US banking, and the state has long profited from that. Regulations are in place, and taxes are paid.Regulations for virtual currencies would ensure both control and a cut of all that trading activity. That’s why subpoena power was exercised. In that light, these moves by the state look much less like inquiries and more like someone trying to catch a slippery fish.The release goes on to mention criminal activity such as drug smuggling, money laundering, weapons dealing and child pornography. The “cloak of anonymity” provided by digital currencies may allow such things to flourish, it implies.Elsewhere, there is mention of creating “appropriate guardrails” to protect consumers … as well as “root out illegal activity and safeguard our national security.”Come on.Bitcoin investors need guardrails no more than tourists in Las Vegas need wallet-minders. And appeals to national security are just farcical.One of the major benefits of Bitcoin is that it is unregulated and thus not susceptible to state manipulation. This includes the protection racket of guardrail installation.Of course, it is the nature of power to maintain the status quo. Regulation of financial transactions has been New York’s territory for a long time, so it cannot take kindly to some upstart dealing on its corners.The state has to push back. Let’s stop trying to embrace regulation for legitimacy’s sake and call this what it is — control.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #New York    #BitLicense  
Federal Elections Commission might allow political Bitcoin donations,Eric Barrier,11/13/2013 14:20,46,0,"The FEC published an opinion letter on November 7 in response to a request regarding the its stance on Bitcoin donations.The commission’s response to the request, made by a group called Conservative Action Fund, states that the group may accept Bitcoin donations, but those have to be exchanged for cash before they can be used as payment.Bitcoin, then, would not be treated the same as cash, but it could be used to support political campaigns.The letter states, “The Commission concludes that CAF may accept [B]itcoins as in-kind contributions under valuation, reporting, and disbursement procedures.”CAF’s request cited BitPay as an example of a Bitcoin payment gateway it might use.The commission’s letter addresses that issue as follows:“Under the BitPay model, CAF could choose whether to receive the contribution in the form of [B]itcoins transferred to CAF’s [B]itcoin wallet, or in the form of US dollars transferred to CAF’s bank account.”A key point is that the FEC does not want Bitcoin to be a tool for anonymizing donations, although anonymity is a primary benefit for the virtual currency’s users. The letter instructs CAF to collect “relevant” informational details for each Bitcoin donor, including name, address and occupation.This all represents another insight into how the US government is grappling with the disruptive technologies of virtual currencies. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security plans to review Bitcoin in Washington, a move sparked by the rapid rise in Bitcoin’s value, which recently crossed the $700 mark.The FEC, for its part, takes great pains to state that Bitcoin is not US currency — or national currency elsewhere, for that matter — but it does recognize Bitcoin’s value.One important distinction the letter also makes is that Bitcoins do not constitute “negotiable instruments.” The US Uniform Commercial Code defines those as “an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money,” and Bitcoins — unlike, say, checks — do not grant anyone the right to be paid in currency.This is just one more example of how decentralized currencies will continue to cause friction for national governments beholden to certain economic paradigms.As has been seen in other states and nations (see California and Israel as recent examples), governments struggle to impose regulations or taxation on Bitcoins.Keep following here, as much more is sure to unfold in this space. ",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Elections    #Donations    #USA  
Bitcoin in India: Drivers and Barriers to Adoption,Darya Alyokhina,11/3/2013 18:20,734,0,"The conditions in such developed countries as China, Argentina, Cyrprus or in developing country like Kenya bear witness to current positions of bitcoin on the worldwide area and shows its potential and advantages over other factors. All these countries mentioned above are characterized by high inflation rates, strong control of capital from the government or there is a combination of both these economic factors\. Such situation appears in India, so it is essential to make an analysis in order to review the current economic position of this country, its climate and the factors which have an influence on propensity of the population to accept the bicoin on a large scale.India’s Rupee Woes The value of the Indian Rupee has decreased sweepingly following to international economic factors and operations of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Analyzing of this problems and their direct influence on the INR can be useful for evaluating the utility of bitcoin in India.From the beginning of the May, there was a considerable declining of Rupee against dollar on 24% and it accessed the lowest point of ?68/$ on the 29th of August. The recent corrections and regulation of the language from the Federal Reserve are the main reasons of this trend which affect on decreasing purchases of asset on 85$ mlrd per month. Due to the decreasing of the monetarization from Fed, the growth rate in USD supply is going to fall and accordingly it makes USD currency stronger and therefore, owing to the USD strengthening, INR and other currencies become weaker significantly.Fed tapering has extra influence on such developing markets like India. To be concrete, due to purchasing fewer US Treasuries (UST), the supply of USTs probably goes up. Meanwhile, the extra supply decreases the the price of UST`s and provides the increasing of the yields on bonds. The effect of such process is ponderable: since May UST yields reached the highest rate, having even 115 basis points.The increasing of UST yields affects negatively on developing markets. According to earlier expectations, all returns grow on comparatively low-risk USTs, money runs-out of high risk investment similar to those in developing markets(India for example) and into USTs, which is much more tempting on a “risk-weighted basis” now. The results are not consolatory: there is an exodus of the capital from such emerging countries as India which makes the amount of USD lower comparing with INR.India’s current account deficit, or the difference in total value between exports and imports, has grown to a record 4.8% of GDP in 2013. This can have two profound effects on the value of the INR. First is the direct impact of sending more money off shore than is flowing back in. Since most international trade is denominated in USD, this means that more USD is leaving India from trade than is returning. As described above, if the availability of USD to INR decreases, the relative value of USD to INR increases.The second meaning of the concept “a current account deficit” is that a country is a net debtor. Due to expectation of increasing the interest rate in India because of US Fed actions, the cost of repaying becomes negative factor for INR because investors propose the inflation the tool of decreasing debts.The current effect of the INR on the prices for goods should not be underestimated. There had been a significant increase of price for oil during the last several years from 76 per barrel in August 2010 to $109 per barrel in August 2013. Due to the fact that the leading position of world oil trade belongs to USD, the increasing in prices causes only the deficit of India`s currency and consequently it decreases USD holdings within India. The one of the most serious consequences of such problem is the maintenance of oil imports from Iran. That means that Iran is one of the minorities of the countries that accepts oil trade denomination in INR. The same effect on the current account balance can be noticed in importing of gold, but for the opposite reason. Being the largest world consuming gold nation, Indian citizens take into consideration the decline in prices of gold reaching its pick of 162 tonnes in May. Nowadays the gold in India being in demand is a cultural historic asset which is always presented as gift on festivals and wedding partiesTaking into the consideration the effect of the current account balance a decline of INT. the government makes an attempt to stop outflows using some tariffs and capital controls. Such capital controls were created by the RBI this month which put the investors and especially the Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in shocked conditions. Furthermore, such capital controls would not be taken into account as India would continue supporting the open economy which led to increasing of the economy in general for the last 6 month in spite of the process of determining of these measures. Some measures on importing gold were adopted by Indian government this year. Such situation causes the growth of importing tariffs on the bijou metals from 6% to 10%. Furthermore now it is essential to get a license from foreign trade office and try to encourage the commercial banks in order to purchase gold directly from consumers and for stemming imports it is important to transfer it to the local refiners. Such actions were attempted in order to increase the prices in India and make them higher on $45/per oz over the prices in London. Indian citizens are searching for alternative ways for wealth storage and historic transactions on a culturally significant commodity at the aggregate expense of the valuation of the INR.Talking about the terms of inflation and capital controls which are familiar to the community of bitcoin, somebody can suggest that Indian citizens should switch to the opportunity in order to accept the digital currency as bitcoin proliferation can become rather important for the ponderable future. At the same moment whereas the demand for gold has increased in India, there are some additional alternative store of wealth offering by multiple applications which ensure stability and no transferring of demand to bitcoin. Moreover, the state can encounter on a range of regulatory and technological concerns before the moment of reaching the broad acceptance by bitcoin.With the RBI placing restrictions on the amount of capital both individuals and corporations can invest overseas, as well as the amount of gold that can be imported, Indians will continue to seek alternative means of wealth transfer and storage. Bitcoin may serve as an opportunity to send investment offshore without having to clear through an intermediary bank, or an alternative store of money if gold becomes inaccessible. This scenario has already unfolded in Argentina under more drastic applications from the same family of regulations; it’s not unreasonable to believe that if similarly pushed that Indians would seek similar measures.As it can be seen from the previous researches, the data shows the interrelation between bitcoin admission and internet penetration in the country below. India takes the sixth lowest place of internet distribution among 100 largest countries with only 12.6% of the citizens having the access to the internet. In spite of the total size of the population of 1.2 billion people in India, it puts the country on the third place with 150 million users of internet-using population in the world after the USA and China.There is a high potential level for bitcoin market in India without broad dissemination because of its enormous total size and population. There are only 0.7% of global connected nodes and 0.8% of the total bitcoin client downloads in India. As a consequence, there are significant increases and decreases of the number of Indian bitcoin exchanges during the last year so it is impossible to get solid footing. Though, it is feasible to purchase and vend bitcoin with the help of websites such as buysellbitco.in and it can promote the appearance of a healthy LocalBitcoins market.The fact that there 71% or approximately 900 million total users of mobile phones in India should not be ignored. Avtually, the mobile users of internet reached those who used computer for accessing in 2004. While only 44 millions of Indians are the subs of smartphones which allow them getting the access to the standard mobile bitcoin wallets, such companies as Coinapult suggests the transactions using standard SMS. Due to the fact that internet still possess the leading positions, such applications as bitcoin wallet lose traction with bitcoin bubble from the beginning of April.The ability of Bitcoin to be transferred between two people using internet access makes it a strong instrument for the global remittance market. The term of remittance or the transferring of the funds from the worker from another country to his home in another way plays a significant role in developing economies. Actually, India has the highest value of remittance in the world in 2011. In accordance with the World Bank, the volume of remittance reached $58 billion or 3.1% of GDP.The 41% of the Indian population staying unbanked wire transfers are not optional. Respectively, it leaves only such money transferring agents as Western Union which takes $25 for $2500 transfer from the USA to India. Bitcoin has involved to this process and such forward-thinking companies as Buttercoin have recently stepped in to apply the potential of bitcoin to these markets.A remaining wildcard in India’s bitcoin story is the future accommodation by the country’s regulators. The Reserve Bank of India has stated that it does not immediately intend to regulate bitcoin, but their historic actions indicate that may change soon enough. The RBI already took significant measures against foreign exchange and gold imports this year in an attempt to slow the Rupee’s slide; if bitcoin is seen as a threat to the stability of the national currency, it would seem probable for similar action to be undertaken.As has been proven historically, greater hurdles are only a sign that bitcoin is needed. Like any other county, as forward-thinking entrepreneurs and bold investors continue to innovate, bitcoin will be poised to solve problems created by the legacy monetary system.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Gold  
Bitcoin Development and the Necessity of Regulations,NikHom,10/29/2013 18:15,109,0,"From the 26th till the 29th of October Berlin, Germany welcomed the conference TechCrunch’s Disrupt Europe 2013. One of the main questions discussed during this convention featured the necessity of regulations for the bitcoin and other crypto currency environment and the perspective of development.The founder of CoinDesk Shakil Khan voiced the opinion everyone could only agree upon that the digital currency community needed new systemized regulations and very strong supervision to bring it closer to the rest of the world, to make it a trustworthy household name for any king of user of the Global web.The panels title where not only Khan, but also Mangrove Capital investor Michael Jackson and Nejc Kodric of the Bitstamp participated, gave the allusion to the EU currency euro. All three agreed that there is still a very long path to go till bitcoins could be compared to this fiat currency uniting a big amount of very different countries.Also the three leading specialists of the branch insisted that the investments have ceased during the past months, and there is a reason for it. The area has to be regulated to attract more people and already existing physical companies. Khan has mentioned that the development of the bitcoin sphere can be divided in three generations. The first generation emerged during the dusk of the crypto currency and most of the companies have been terminated. Almost no company from this generation can be found active in the present time. The second generation can be observed nowadays. All the main services, exchangers, retail and small vendors belong to it. The third one is the progressive future of the bitcoin that soon will arrive.All three have mentioned that the current companies lack in experience of business and often do not understand the basic rules of economy and business. Thins cannot be built upon pure hope and energy of the founder. The generation process of ideas is very good, there are many perspective ideas that without professional advice might parish on the boarder of the second and third generation.The future comes with companies who have already experiences their up and down, have tries startups even on the web, where among good technicians are lawyers, statisticians, marketing specialists, PR managers and other people necessary to establish, promote and bring further the company.To attract successful businessman from the physical companies strict regulations are necessary. The first step done by the Chinese Baidu is a great example. This opportunity should be evaluated as the best advertising for the bitcoin community. The next step should be directed towards the EU. The panel members insist that the success in one of 28 countries if the European Union will lead to acceptance of the coin all over the continent. The population of EU is very pragmatic, if they start trusting the system it will spread very fast. The first aimed countries should be the Eastern Europe, including Scandinavia and the Baltic states.The great thing about EU that when of the countries will develop policy on the matter others might adopt it. The bitcoin system might push aside Western Union and other companies offering money transactions because of smaller fees and bigger speed of processing of deals.In the end Khan added that he things that big companies will come to bitcoin, because it is a far smaller risk than the ones already relieved by the investors. ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Germany    #TechCrunch  
Understanding state-level money transmission licenses,Eric Barrier,9/28/2013 10:05,102,0,"Marco Santori of the Bitcoin Foundation has a piece up on CoinDesk in which he explores money transmission licenses at the state level in the US.This, he argues, is much trickier than simple FinCEN registration.The state with jurisdiction ultimately decides whether to grant a business a license to transmit money. It’s not a right, and it’s no entirely predictable for a 50-state rollout.Also, because a business meets FinCEN’s definition of a money transmitter does not mean the same applies at the state level. South Carolina and Montana do not even require licenses for such companies, and New Mexico seems not to worry about it for Bitcoin businesses.The problem so far, though, is that the other 47 states have not been too forthcoming about their own requirements for licensed Bitcoin transmitters.What we do know is that states will reserve the right to police a business that has customers in state, regardless of whether the business itself is located in another state or on the moon.You can see how this might apply to a decentralized, state-independent currency. And that also explains why some Bitcoin exchanges don’t even allow US customers.Santori offers two pieces of information that can help determine whether a state will require a money transmission license. The first is having an attorney review the statutes on a state-by-state basis. That’s already tough given archaic and obsolete laws still on the books.Santori cites New York as a particularly useful example: The state’s law never defines “money transmission” or “money” itself.Another option Santori offers is called a “request for ruling,” in which an attorney drafts a letter to each state’s regulating body asking for a ruling on the client’s business model. While this guarantees a great deal more certainty, it is obviously time-consuming.And to anyone simply considering ignoring money transmitter licensing, Santori offers the examples of FastCash4Bitcoin, which received a warning from its Commonwealth of Virginia, and all the Bitcoin businesses in New York whose owners were subpoenaed over the summer.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Marco Santori    #Bitcoin Foundation    #FinCEN    #USA

A North Carolina appeals court disposed a retrial for Cisco employee who ostensibly strangled his wife and after this accident he used Google Maps for searching the proper place for hiding the murdered woman. The advocate of Mister Cooper, Howard Kurtz, made an inquiry to Jay Ward who was the network computer security expert and established the fact that the Google Maps program was installed on the personal computer of defendant long after this accident. Thanks to this expertise, the appeals court reversed the decision of the judge and acquitted the man.Mapping the Bitcoin economy could reveal users' identities.Majority of people suggest that Bitcoin is a completely anonymous program and the transactions and the clients using the Bitcoin are never been tracked. But, according to the new researchers of California University in San-Diego, the only shadowing of the transactions of Bitcoin provides an enormous help to law enforcement. In accordance with MIT Technology Review, this agency can follow the bitcoin flows from illegitimate transactions to the bitcoin exchange and consequently convene the company o the judge.

How US regulators received Bitcoin proponents,Eric Barrier,8/27/2013 16:45,42,0,"From the US government, officials present in the meeting represented FinCEN, the DOJ, the FBI, Homeland Security and the IRS, among other agencies.This was Bitcoin’s first real audience on Capitol Hill and the community’s first chance to make a good impression face-to-face with would-be regulators. The digital currency is still an enigma to many policy makers, and the clarity was welcome from both sides.Jerry Brito, from George Mason University, confirmed that some officials were dubious about Bitcoin users’ intentions.“You could tell the folks there were certainly concerned about the potential use of Bitcoin for illicit purposes,” he told the Washington Post. Bitcoin proponents tried to make the case that this was not in Bitcoin’s design or even in the interest of the digital economy, but the one meeting was not enough to settle Feds’ fears.Representatives of the interests of Bitcoin itself included the Bitcoin Foundation, who composed a five-member panel to discuss the opportunities available to startups and small businesses around the world.The foundation warned that, given Bitcoin’s international reach, regulation would simply force businesses to set up shop elsewhere, eventually costing jobs and tax revenue. Meanwhile, other countries would have the chance to import American innovation for free.A representative from the libertarian think tank Cato Institute said Bitcoin is a chance to for money transfers to operate on a much more free-market system.Jim Harper, the institute’s director of information policy studies, cited the $3 fee many people have to pay to withdraw money from an ATM. A system such as Bitcoin all but eliminates those transaction costs and end-user feeds.One good sign was that officials seemed far more interested in learning about the currency rather than trying to confront it as a threat. Patrick Murck from the Bitcoin Foundation expressed relief in FinCEN’s attitude. He paraphrased FinCEN’s stance like this: “Not only are we going to [be open and transparent], but we’re going to introduce you to the whole regulatory community.”",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA  
What happened at the US regulators’ bitcoin meeting?,Eric Barrier,8/27/2013 15:35,770,0,"General Counsel, Patrick Murck, tells that the meeting was a “productive and frank” discussion about new digital currency. “It was a positive first step for the industry in creating an open and on-going dialog. I left feeling very encouraged that we were able to dispel some myths and misinformation about how the bitcoin protocol works.”- adds Murck.Reminding, Bitcoin is a new digital currency which is starting to spread widely across the world and is getting a lot of attention in United States right now. These are the coins you can send through the internet. It has a number of advantages, like person to person transactions, instead of sending money through the bank, the fees are much lower, your account cannot be frozen and much more. One of the main priorities of the digital currency is the fact that no central authority is intermediating.Director of information policy, Jim Harper, tells about the discussed topics at US treasury building in Washington DC, where the meeting was held. He states that topics such as law enforcement, privacy and the way government would control the industry were brought up, which is according to Harper is a very negative influence towards Bitcoin industry. “We talked about how the weight of regulation in the US can, and does, drive bitcoin service providers to move outside of the country,” claims Harper. He also states that Bitcoin Foundation was able to explain what exactly the blockchain is and how it works, therefore being successful in eliminating all the doubts and uncertainties whether there is some “magical secrecy” to bitcoin. “I counselled against the practice of spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) about bitcoin, which is already all too common. It’s not OK to talk bitcoin down without a factual basis.” – insists Jim Harper.Apparently US government is nervous to lose the control over taxation and currency manipulation with cryptocurrency spreading in United States. Bitcoin is governed by mathematical formulas, not a private board, which makes it harder for US government to manipulate currency.There were many sceptics at the meeting, bringing up questions that indicates “hostility to progressive change” – says Harper. However, he also concluded that although most people were sceptical, they were also open- minded and fair. There are some insecurities around US- based bitcoiners that regulators will stand against digital currency in US territory, therefore causing a lot of trouble to bitcoin industry, since there are loads of lion’s share of bitcoin businesses and enthusiasts in the country.As already mentioned, Bitcoin is extremely popular in US in comparison to other countries for now. The number of US downloads of the original bitcoin client compiles 460, 394 times, which is more than a number of downloads in China, the UK and Germany summed up.All the transactions are public, therefore anyone can see users’ identification, by knowing some additional needed information. Therefore, there is another meeting in Capitol Hill today regarding the discussion about legal issues concerning cryptocurrency.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Bitcoin Foundation  
Senate pressing regulators on Bitcoin risks and oversight,Eric Barrier,8/13/2013 10:45,45,0,"A Senate homeland security committee seeks explanations from federal regulators and law enforcement officials as to how they plan to oversee digital currencies.This follows months of climbs in value for Bitcoin, which started the year trading at $15 and has since surpassed $200.Governments now are on notice and concerned about how digital markets and decentralized, unregulated currencies will affect commerce.And crime.The Bitcoin marketplace is now four years old and valued at more than $1 billion. Startups in this space are trying to figure out nebulous government regulations while governments sweat issues such as money laundering and tax evasion.The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee sent letters to the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of Management and Budget.A committee aide is on record as saying that a balance must be struck between dealing with threats and risks and not stifling “a potentially valuable technology.”Thus far, no hearings are schedules, nor is any draft legislation in the works.Politico reports a key concern to the committee is quick action to make sure threats do not spiral beyond their control. The threat would then become an overreaction on the part of agencies as they scrambled to triage any perceived threats.The committee aide admitted Washington’s reputation as “not being ahead of the curve” on innovation and tech issues.Of interest to the committee and law enforcement is the anonymity — or at least pseudonymity — that Bitcoin provides. Without identities behind transactions, criminal moves and fraud would be harder to track.Some hardline Bitcoin supporters question whether any oversight is welcome or even compatible with an international currency without a central regulating body.Others, Patrick Murck of the Bitcoin Foundation, have said regulators need to make these kinds of moves and do a better job of reaching out.“Regulatory uncertainty right now is the bottleneck for innovation in this space,” he said.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA  
"PBoC: Regulators Should Help Bitcoin Exchanges, Not Prohibit Them",Joseph Young,3/9/2017 12:55,320,265,"This week, the People’s Bank of China’s, hereinafter PBoC, business management department director Zhou Xuedong told the nation’s regulators that they must adopt a forgiving attitude towards exchanges and not prohibit their operations.Over the past few months, China’s central bank and the PBoC has actually been praised for their efforts to communicate with local Bitcoin exchanges and introduce efficient regulatory frameworks.""Unlike several government agencies and regions such as Hawaii, which recently forced the major Bitcoin company Coinbase out of the state with impractical policies, the PBoC has been leading round table discussions with local businesses to come to a consensus on which regulations should and shouldn’t be adopted."" Contrary to the government’s view of Bitcoin in 2013, a period in which the PBoC attempted to ban Bitcoin as a whole, the PBoC is demonstrating optimism towards its local Bitcoin industry.It brought transparency in Bitcoin trading and reduced market manipulation by pressuring exchanges to implement trading fees of 0.2 percent.According to PBoC director Zhou Xuedong, the central bank’s vision of Bitcoin development and industry acceptance has changed drastically since 2013. In fact, Xuedong encouraged all the regulators within the Chinese market to refrain from enforcing regulations that may hurt local businesses and operations dealing with Bitcoin.In the short-term, Xuedong emphasized the importance of establishing a clear and transparent industry standard which Bitcoin exchanges can follow. By doing so, exchanges will be in full understanding of the regulatory requirements prior to launching their operations to the public.""While Xuedong stated that Bitcoin exchanges will be placed under strict supervision, for the time being, he also noted that during this observation period, regulators will actively communicate with local businesses to ensure that the market grows at an exponential rate."" Local publications including Sina further reported that Xuedong requested regulators to obtain necessary knowledge regarding the properties of Bitcoin. These include Bitcoin’s structure, attributes and characteristics. He implied that regulators shouldn’t try to regulate Bitcoin companies with a shallow understanding of the currency itself.“In the future, it is necessary to explore long-term regulatory mechanisms. We need to research the properties of digital currencies like Bitcoin, study the characteristics of Bitcoin exchanges and explore management policies at a national level,” said Xuedong.""One of the nationwide policies that the Chinese government and its central bank intend to adopt is the creation of a cross-exchange database which will sync user identities of exchanges in one single platform."" Xuedong hinted that the PBoC may look into Blockchain technology if necessary.The approval of such a policy could intensify Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies even more in the future and could require existing exchanges to upgrade their KYC and AML systems once again.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Peopleâ€™s Bank of China  
Cashless Hooplah! How Indian Banks Want to Bleed Poorest of the Poor,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,3/5/2017 12:39,263,255,"Indians are about to discover that using cash is expensive. According to reports in India’s Hindustan Times newspaper, leading private banks in the country including HDFC, ICICI and Axis will pile a charge of Rs. 5 for every Rs. 1,000 transacted or Rs. 150 - whatever amount happens to be higher.The transaction charges while making ATM transactions will also be applicable. Currently, Indians can make five free transactions at the ATMs of their home bank’s cash machines. They are charged Rs. 20 per transaction from every sixth withdrawal. In the case of inter-bank transactions, only three transactions are allowed per month.The Indian state has declared a war on cash, which is ill conceived, silly and downright detrimental to the economic welfare of the citizenry.A lot of Indians are living in areas where there is a critical lack of digital resources. According to the census of India, there are 593,731 villages in the country. Out of this, 55,669 villages have no mobile coverage whatsoever. Remote areas in India tend to generally have slower 2G networks.According to the Ericsson Mobility Report published in 2016:“There is a clear urban-rural divide in the telecommunications sector in India. The teledensity in urban areas is three times higher than in rural areas, as of the end of 2015, and the divide is even higher for internet users. Internet subscription has huge growth potential in both rural and urban areas in India, with total subscription at just 25 percent of the population.”So with such terrible telepenetration, how is India supposed to transact digitally? Will India’s poor be the ones who will end up making banks richer by paying these ridiculous charges on bank transactions?Indian ATM security has been in debate of late. According to the Economic Times (ET), between May to July 2016, India was hit by the worst ever cyber breach. This security lapse happened at ATMs managed by Hitachi systems and a leading private bank in India.According to the ET: “ET learns that the hackers created a “dummy code book” within the Hitachi system — capturing all possible four-digit numbers from 0000 to 9999 — to steal the PINs (personal identification numbers) of customers as and when they used their cards to withdraw money from ATMs of a private bank in India.”This ATM hack has likely compromised 3.2 mln debit cards in the country. Attacking cash at such a time puts Indian customers at definite risk, especially when the security measures of digital payments companies are being questioned by a recent forensic audit report related to the data breach submitted to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The Times of India says about the state of cybersecurity at Indian banks:“Antivirus and anti-malware devices they have installed (banks) are no match for targeted cyber attacks. What this means is that if the code of a malware, floated by the hacker, is written in a clever way, it can overcome most anti-malware walls.”The Reserve Bank has faltered and floundered its way through India’s demonetization process with flip-flops and its uncertain policies and is overseeing a banking system that has largely been unable to reach into the depths of India and provide services to a large swathe of Indians.According to the Indian government’s report on financial inclusion, “Overview and Progress on Financial Inclusion,” 58.7 percent of Indian households have no access to banking. PricewaterhouseCoopers pegs the unbanked population in India at around 233 mln people. This is more than the population of Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Certainly, in that case, India’s assault on cash is an assault on these poor people.Yet, the Reserve Bank of India wants to nip innovation in the bud by repeatedly cautioning people on using means that are beyond its control, like digital currencies. The Indian Express quoted the Deputy Governor of the RBI, R.Gandhi, at the FinTech Conference 2017, organized by FICCI, IBA and Nasscom, as saying: “Payments by such currencies are on a peer-to-peer basis. No established framework for recourse to customer problems, disputes/ chargebacks, etc. is feasible.”Ironic coming from a man who runs a similar operation but thinks there are problems when virtual currencies do the same in a transparent and secure manner.Perhaps the deputy governor forgot that chargebacks are not possible for payments made in rupees either and as for transparency and security of his commercial banker friends’ digital products, banks in India just put 3.2 mln Indian customers up the creek without a paddle.The irony is delicious.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Banks    #Digital Currency    #Cash  
"Worldwide Phenomenon: Banks Hate Bitcoin, Curious About Blockchain",Iyke Aru,2/24/2017 16:10,1892,648,"Nearly a month to the time of writing, online Bitcoin wallet provider Cryptopay, which provides services for buying and selling Bitcoins, notified its users in the UK that deposits and withdrawals in pounds would be declined due to the ""updated bank policies."" Cryptopay did not state categorically the particular updates that have given rise to its current actions.Since the rise in popularity of Bitcoin, restrictions within the UK targeting the cryptocurrency has been a recurrent event. Cryptopay is not the only exchange taking such a drastic decision. Nearly a dozen other exchanges have seen issues with UK deposits and withdrawals throughout their existence. For some reason, the UK banking system does not take kindly to Bitcoin companies.George Basiladze of Cryptopay is of the opinion that traditional banking systems all over the world are not comfortable with Bitcoin. According to him, Barclays, one of the largest world regulators, has recently updated its policy towards private banking and e-money services and, subsequently, a wave of license revocations stroke all over.A good example is Safello, which has passed through Barclay's own aggregator but have yet to open a bank account.Basiladze says:“Currently, sending just three payments with ""Bitcoin"" reflecting anywhere in the transaction is enough to attract a bank account closure in the UK zone.”However, Basiladze explains that Cryptopay already puts a system in place to protect itself from the extreme decisions relating to Barclays. This is achieved by the company maintaining GBP account in reserve in another European country for situations such as that currently experienced. He notes that the hatred towards Bitcoin is a worldwide phenomenon, therefore, the said bank has also been affected by the same updated regulations.He continues by explaining that for customers from the US, Cryptopay only recalled the deposits and withdrawals of funds from a list of options, noting that as shown in the example with Safello, such situations are not peculiar to Cryptopay as competitors are also expected to face difficulties in one form or the other.Another point noted by Basiladze is that the goal of Cryptopay and similar services is aiding those who can't open a traditional bank account, so it's no wonder traditional banks are uncomfortable with the competition that such systems bring. Traditional banking services cherish the control that they have over the people and their money and will do everything within their powers not to let go.Bitcoin offers a system that returns control and power to the real owners of money and the only way to fight for it is to show the will of the people - i.e. using Bitcoin and private banking services.Basiladze concludes:“Right now we're looking for a way to avoid traditional system's spokes in our wheels. It should be a stable solution for our UK clients to freely withdraw and deposit in the currency they like, whether these are pounds, dollars or Bitcoins. While waiting for a solution, our clients in the UK can send us funds through SEPA transfers.”Irina S. Zimakova, the co-founder and vice-president of the European Blockchain Federation, tells Cointelegraph that the perceived fierce resistance of Bitcoin by banks, in general, seems somewhat blown out of proportion. Zimakova says that the issue can be explained in multiple ways.On a finance level, she says, Bitcoin is a finite virtual currency with front-end (e-wallet) stability issues and a scalability capped at approximately 21 mln, making it a curiosity and not a threat when compared to the trillions of euros in effect. She also notes that EU banks are experimenting with their own Bitcoin cryptocurrency, such as Dutch DNB Bank with “DNBcoin.”Meanwhile, economically speaking, banks worldwide and, in particular, the European Central Bank wish to gain more control over evolving cryptocurrencies in an effort to manage future long-term risk.Zimakova notes that a few weeks ago European Parliament proposed amending a directive requiring all member states to identify Bitcoin owners as of June 26, 2017, in order to halt anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing. A salient detail is that a very recent Europol report explicitly states there is no evidence of ISIS using Bitcoin as a means to finance its activities.Zimakova says:“People as a species resist change, this is in our genes by nature. Young people averaging age 18 to 30 have idealistic views of tomorrow's world that catalyze change. Banks and politicians defy change because to them it equals risk: the many Compliance & Regulatory Directives underline their efforts to control risk. We should not be worried over Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, we should worry more about the Blockchain -Bitcoin's underlying technology- which will transform the world as we know it. This is why I co-founded the European Blockchain Federation: to unite all parties involved anticipating future changes through Agile-like discussions with the world thought leaders in order to ensure a hyper-intelligent and smooth transition into the digital era.”Zimakova concludes by saying that as the acceptance of Bitcoin grows by over 100,000 merchants, the likes of Apple and Mercedes will spiral into the majority and the adoption of Bitcoin by banks, ultimately, is only a matter of time.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Cryptopay

Could you talk a little bit about that?YB: I am, believe it or not, quite a fan of government regulations. By background I was the former global CEO of Citigroup, I currently sit on the Federal Reserve faster payment task force. So my view on regulation is that regulation is good and regulation actually legitimizes a business. So I'm not a big fan of an uber-libertarian movement, which says that regulation is bad and we don't need any of this, and the world is going to be perfect without any regulation.CT: ?ryptocurrencies are hoped by some to be used to sort of disrupt the system and take everything and make it something new. Davos is not like that. And you see Blockchain all over the place in Davos. Why do you think that is?YB: Interestingly enough, this is the first year in Davos that we have seen so many Blockchain companies. The World Economic Forum itself, if you look at the formal program, has probably about two hours of Blockchain programming. The issues that concern the World Economic Forum are far more diverse and far deeper than Blockchain itself. Blockchain is an important technology, clearly, probably, one of the most important technologies. But Blockchain also has, basically, the way I would say, has given birth to many great technologies but also many hucksters. And I think that is common knowledge in this industry, we see Blockchain companies, you know, selling things such as, unfortunately, things like prostitution. Or other types of things that are not really part and parcel of a global system and shouldn’t be a part of the global system.I think Blockchain does a lot in terms of global trade, doing trade finance, doing things that don’t require high-velocity transactions or high-frequency transactions. But there is a lot you can do in Blockchain. Municipal governments, property titles, you know, municipal fines – all sorts of records can be put in a Blockchain. But not everything fits on the Blockchain. When I was global CTO of Citibank, we did three to nine tln dollars of transactions a day. And as you know, the Blockchain itself in its totality, given all the crypto of Bitcoin and Ethereum, don’t even come close to a trillion dollars a day.CT: How people who are looking at a legitimate company or ICO should go about thinking through their investments, coming from your perspective? How do you spot the huckster?YB: Look, here's what I see about ICOs, right? Right now, an ICO happens, somebody's come up with a great idea and then suddenly hires two developers, four developers, they write on the ERC20 protocol and they have an ICO. Essentially short-circuiting what it's been a long formal process of an initial public offering. In a lot of ways that's good. Because it expands access to capital. However, it doesn't give an excuse for beginning to go and offer things to the market, that border on silly, if not criminal.I think that if you're looking for an ICO and you think you want to invest in an ICO  look at the team, this is a pretty standard piece of advice. But look, if they're open to getting themselves registered. Many companies are doing ICOs, that are not afraid of the registration process. Many companies are not afraid of regulation. And fully put themselves in front of regulators and make themselves available to questions, make themselves available to criticism much like any other IPO process. I personally like ICOs. But! Given that there are probably thousands if not tens of thousands of ICOs, that are forthcoming, it's a buyer beware market. That's all I could say for that!",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #ICO    #Tokens    #Davos  
Exchanges open in France would require registration,Neil Bergen,2/4/2014 14:47,100,0,"France has begun to follow new trend among government officials to request licenses for the management of Bitcoin.After the decision by D.C.’s officials to finally notice an elephant in the room and assign some status to Bitcoin, others began to follow the example. Last Wednesday the French Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR) made a public announcement that Bitcoin exchanges are now viewed and treated as payment service. Hence, the approval of ACPR is a necessary requirement for any business that includes being a third party in cryptocurrency exchange operations.Surely, all the warnings that go side by side with any official statement on Bitcoin are also present. Thus ACPR reminds us that digital currencies are unstable, do not possess any legal protection in case they are lost or stolen and of course that wallets on our PCs are susceptible to hacking (as if cash is not susceptible to pickpocket). The regulator also did not forget to reference European Banking Authority, which has already discouraged people from using cryptos on numerous occasions.The ones who will stay unaffected are Bitcoin users, last instructions from French officials do not touch upon the holders of digital currencies. However, there is always a catch. The authority also made it clear that Bitcoin traders who manage the exchange of cryptos to fiat and the other way around, have to work along with a registered provider. So, for an exchange platform that is stationed in France to make a simple act of selling Bitcoin to its customer, would require a transaction to be made through a payment institution or credit institution and so on.Speaking of catch, due to the reason described above the fee that Bitcoin traders would ask for an act of selling or buying crypto could potentially grow higher. While it won’t be much noticeable for some time, ties that French regulators want establish between cryptos and traditional banking systems in a way negate the basic idea of Bitcoin. On the bright side though, the connection to such institutions would potentially bring more investors that were discouraged by the “rebellious spirit” that accompanied digital currencies with the arrival of Satoshi’s creation.Again, the official statement by ACPR was tied to the Shem’s and Faiella’s arrests and investigation.  As with Skandinavska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB AB), the policy was announced after a few days of media raving with news that former two has been selling cryptos to drug dealers connected with the infamous Silk Road.As the avalanche of official statements on crypto regulations continues the price of Bitcoin so far is relatively stable (if can speak of stability, regarding Bitcoin). Either the popularity and big player involvement has made digital currencies tougher to such blows, or the crisis is yet to come, when regulations become stricter and more widespread.Anyway, the Bitcoin is alive while the cryptomovement supports it, and I don’t see it gives up anywhere soon.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #France    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Banks  
Australia’s Tax Office Delays Decision on Bitcoin,Allen Scott,6/30/2014 15:50,97,0,"Back in April, the Cointelegraph reported on Australia’s Tax Office (ATO) gearing up to meet with head figures of the Bitcoin industry, accounting and tax experts to issue a ruling on digital currencies in the country that was expected to be delivered on June 30.With the deadline here, the ATO now reports that it has delayed the much anticipated ruling until further notice, essentially leaving the fate of the country’s thriving Bitcoin economy “in limbo.”Many had hoped that some possible tax guidance would be released with the decision before the end of the fiscal year. Apparently, the ATO is now seeking Australia's Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson for further assistance as it attempts to tackle the issue of whether digital currencies are money or property.  An ATO spokesman stated that the department received “numerous” submissions from the public about how to approach digital currencies with regards to regulation and taxation. ""To ensure our advice to the community is comprehensive and robust we have sought further advice from external legal counsel,"" said the spokesman. ""We have also received representations from industry bodies seeking to provide us with further information."" According to the spokespman, the ATO office delayed its decision to make sure the ruling was in accordance with Australian law.  The Bitcoin Association of Australia responded by saying it was disappointed with the pushback but supported the involvement of General Justin Gleeson in the matter and acknowledged that rushing such an important decision would not be wise.The association president Jason Williams commented:""As digital currencies such as Bitcoin are now a permanent part of our financial landscape, it is important for Australian regulators and legislators to foster and nurture growth.""The ATO's position will deliver one of the first precedents in the Australian legal and regulatory landscape and will be an influential benchmark.""As such, it is important not to rush decisions.""- Jason Williams, President, Bitcoin Association of AustraliaAustralia is considered to be one of the most Bitcoin-friendly nations in the world who has its own share of Bitcoin ATMs, merchants, exchanges, and VC funds. Therefore, a delay or any ambivalence from the government on any guidance essentially puts the country’s thriving economy in a regulatory gray area. Amidst the uncertainty, merchants accepting BTC payments must do business without a clear definition of what taxes they may be subject to now or in the future. Moreover, with the fiscal year coming to a close, many could be left with lengthy tax bills as a result of the wait. Interestingly enough, Freedom of Information (FOI) documents revealed that the ATO has been taking Bitcoin seriously and keeping a close eye on cryptocurrency news and developments both at home and abroad because it was concerned that people may be using Bitcoin or other digital currencies for tax evasion.Now, hopefully with the help of the country’s second law officer, General Justin Gleeson, Australia will be able to issue some guidance on Bitcoin in accordance with national laws in the near future and clear up the smoke so the Bitcoin space can further develop in the country.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Australia    #Government    #Taxes  
"Fed says it cannot regulate Bitcoin, would rely on existing legislations",Michael K. Hamilton,3/3/2014 9:37,96,0,"Federal Reserve Board chair Janet Yellen told Congress last week that the Fed has no authority to regulate Bitcoin.“Bitcoin is a payment innovation that’s taking place outside the banking industry,” Yellen said in response to Senator Joe Manchin’s questions about the cryptocurrency. “To the best of my knowledge there’s no intersection at all, in any way, between Bitcoin and banks that the Federal Reserve has the ability to supervise and regulate. So the Fed doesn’t have authority to supervise or regulate Bitcoin in anyway.”While Yellen noted that Bitcoin could be used for illegal activities, she said that regulators felt US law was sufficient to deal with any illicit Bitcoin activity in the country.The day before, Manchin had written to various governmental bodies calling for regulations of Bitcoin in the wake of Mt. Gox’s collapse.Periodic scary stories such as Mt. Gox’s — and Charlie Shrem’s arrest, and the Silk Road bust — get hands wringing in Washington. Calls for tighter regulation inevitably follow.But, as Yellen herself noted, “It’s not so easy to regulate Bitcoin because there’s no central issuer or network operator.”Marchin also asked Yellen whether she thought America was “behind the curve” on Bitcoin regulation. Marchin himself noted that Thailand and China had banned the currency and that South Korea has spoken out strongly against its legitimacy.Yellen replied again that the Fed has no authority over Bitcoin but encouraged Congress to consider “what the right legal structure would be for digital currencies.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Janet Yellen    #Federal Reserve    #Mt.Gox    #USA  
The Central Bank of Russia Aims to Protect Citizenry from Bitcoin,Sascha Carroll,1/28/2014 17:54,94,0,"The Central Bank of Russian Federation has issued an official statement on the matters of the so-called “virtual currencies”, including Bitcoin as the most well-known and widespread type of cryptocoins at present time. The financial institution aims to protect the citizenry of the country from possible violations that might occur in case individuals or legal entities get engaged in the online activities, like purchase, selling and exchange.  The information provided by the press service of the Central Bank shows the determination to protect users from losing of funds due to instability and missing regulation of the field:“Virtual currencies” lack provision and legally obliged subjects. The operations with them have a speculative character, are performed on the so-called “virtual exchange services” and carry a high risk of loss of value.”According to the citation the institution is not willing to support the digital currencies and to perform the role of the necessary legally obliged subject issuing legislative acts and regulating out controversial situations.The published document also prohibits exchanging the virtual coins, for example Bitcoin, to other types of currencies (fiat and recognized units), as well as goods, services and completed work. Bitcoin cannot be considered as a fair payment for employees and is not tolerated as a matter of exchange on the network. The statement says:“The Bank of Russia warns citizens and legal entities, first of all, credit institutions and non-credit financial organizations, form usage of “virtual currencies” as an exchange matter for goods (work, services) or bankroll in rubles or foreign currency.”The “virtual currencies” are also named “money surrogates” by the central Bank after the Federal Law of the country. The performance of any kind of activities both by private and legal entities is considered as crime, even if it completed involuntarily, without being conscious of the repercussions. The full text can be observed in the previous publication of the Cointelegraph.The in 2008 developed cryptocurrency Bitcoin was offered to the society by Satoshi Nakamoto. His personality is still kept secret, but some rumors propose that the name covers a group of activists – authors of the invention. The rising interest that was followed or even initiated by the increase of the price of the coin, optimization of mining software and new merchants appearing every day, accepting the coin, have made the Bitcoin a topic of interest for the most authorities. Several European countries, among them Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Poland, tolerate the presence of the currency on the market and issue minor warnings without serious prohibitions. The people’s republic of China was among the pioneers, who succeeded to ban the coin indirectly. While the operations with the funds in virtual money are not prohibited, legal entities cannot provide users with deposit and withdrawal of funds via personal bank or similar accounts. The Russian federation was among the first countries to issue a very clear statement that leaves no trace of doubt.However, the deed is surprising, as only a month ago German Gref voiced his interest in cryptographic currencies, determined them as future instrument of finance and economy, even was willing to set up a virtual coin on the basics of Yandex-Money. It is an unexpected move from the chair of the Central Bank.On the contrary, Anatoli Knyazev, from the company Exante, which operates a hedge-fund of Bitcoins, is not sure that the sense of the statement is univocal:  “Currently, it is not clear from the statement of the Bank of Russia whether the use of Bitcoin is generally prohibited.”He also believes that this particular issue and similar from foreign countries could destabilize the coin network. There are no laws or rules that might bring real accusations to users. Many warnings, especially the one of China, have had a negative impact on the price, but the amount of users has not been affected.The CEO of ICBIT (exchange service) Aleksey Bragin supports the opinion of Mr. Knyazev. He adds that the Bitcoin has to be considered as a successful alternative instrument, not as a form of money. Also he points out that the laws and rules miss out the definition of money surrogates. Even in case Bitcoin is considered as a form of surrogate than he has to be officially recognized by the government. At the same time, extracted or mined coins have no link to a geographic point; they cannot be associated with Russia or any other jurisdiction. These complications prevent the official institutions from any other activities, except for issuing of similar warnings.Cointelegraph is going to follow the situation, but while we are working on the matter, please, feel free to voice Your opinions in the comments of this article.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Central Bank    #Russia

Local Currencies Too Alternative Even for Bitcoin,Agatha Bookchin,2/12/2014 13:36,85,0,"The simplest explanation of the term “Local Currency” might sound like an alternative to virtual currencies like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, and a double alternative to the fiat currencies like the Sterling Pound or Dollar. It is a deep underground of monetary policy no one aims to hide or to speculate on. Local currencies just exist, have a parallel flow to traditional examples and the supporters are logically limited to an area – district, city, island or any other geographically predetermined community. The most examples can be met on the British Isles as the official state pound is one of the oldest moneys of the world (in its common form of coins and bank notes) and sets an example for emission of reserved values.  Any type of money is destined to disappear as long as there are no two individuals willing to perform exchange. For example an organic grocery store deep in the wilds of South London accepts payments completed with pounds or transferred by a smartphone. To be precise the merchant is not willing to attract any kind of publicity or make a promotion as many vendors do with Bitcoin. He is just among some others seeing in a local currency a real competitor to the state supported money. The modest store is named the Brixton Wholefoods in the lead of Tony Benest, a 30-year old inhabitant of Brixton, who shares the details with pleasure. The local pound exists around the same five years as the invention of Satoshi Nakamoto, but does no bear the ambitions to replace all existing world currencies to provide equality and liberty. Benest explains:“It’s an additional form of payment for people who don’t have a credit or debit card, or don’t want to get involved with the banks.”The Brixton Pound exists in the two possible forms. Since 2009 it can be touched and carried in the wallet as the notes have been printed. The units are very colorful; carry images of famous people originating from the district (none other, for example, as David Bowie) and have all necessary protection features to prevent imitation (watermarks, holograms, ordinal numbers and other methods of security). Currently, numerous transactions are made with an SMS adding to the system an online component. The logo is derived from the Sterling Pound (B£), but the administrative activities are performed by Brixton Pound Community Interest Company. The digital aspect makes from the local currency a relative of the Bitcoin – distinct, but sometimes feeling an echo from global events.Brett Scott, a Brixton resident and author of “The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance” denies the link between the increasing popularity of Bitcoin and the local affection to the Brixton Pound. Even being not regulated by the authorities does not make them similar. The events in the life of the Brixton Pound do not necessarily mirror the shocks and praise relieved by the global phenomena. Considered as an alternative, both currencies have different advantages and attract users with various methods. According to Mr. Scott:“In reality, Bitcoin tends to appeal to a very different crowd. Local currencies are all about building community ties, whereas Bitcoin [...] is focused on preserving personal autonomy and personal wealth.”It means that Bitcoin gives its best to provide a link between people far away from each other, but local items try to form a sodality – format of relationships lost during the industrial revolution and further technical and scientific progress. Leander Bindewald, a researcher on complementary currencies at the New Economics Foundation, agrees that both items have less in common, as local units do not have the goal to create an additional income, do not serve as investment for extraordinary returns. This aspect clearly shows that local currencies make a bigger emphasis on exchange, everyday use in comparison with tradable Bitcoin. He claims:“Bitcoin’s big user community has never merged with a local community. [Local currencies] are intrinsically different from Bitcoin.”Although there are main differences between the currencies, the big brother Bitcoin might support the local examples in some ways. Mr. Bindewald explains it with an example – the Bitcoin succeeded to attract the attention of the policy makers. The composition and implementation of rules or laws will determine the lives of local currencies as well, allowing them to leave their unnatural underground. He also comments on Bitcoin:“Policy makers are realizing that Bitcoin is asking questions they can’t answer. In this case, it’s great because Bitcoin is challenging the paradigm.”Tom Shakhli, the engagement manager for the Brixton Pound, believes that positive movement around the widely known virtual currencies brings some additional points to local values. At present stage it is not a big problem that people hearing about local moneys associate them with digital currencies existing merely online. As long as it provides no harm, the additional publicity can only stimulate the development. Mr. Shakhli states:“We all fall under the same umbrella, which is alternatives to national currencies. We are all part of that family, I guess. Each one gives the other more credibility.”He is not even afraid to draw fantastic long-term forecasts. He foresees:“I imagine in five years’ time, there’ll be some really popular digital currencies, and maybe 50 more local currencies in the UK. I think that’s a safe prediction.”The prosperous picture of the future drawn gets covered with dust as Mr. Bindewald advices the local currencies to deny too close relationships with Bitcoin. The successful party might turn to be a stone bind to the neck – all negative attitudes, decisions and regulations will impact them and maybe flush away. The lack of education of officials might prevent the blossom of the Brixton Pound and other forms of money. He says:“There might be negative effects, if the regulation of bitcoin goes in such a way that all alternative currencies are thrown into the same bucket and then dismissed by the regulator.”    In case, dear reader, You are not acquainted with the peculiarities of English economy and finance, do not be surprised to hear that the Brixton Pound is not the only local currency in the UK. The town of Totnes in south Devon having around 7000 citizens was first to introduce a new alternative unit of exchange. However, the largest area using a local currency is the city Bristol. Even the council tax can be paid in the local money and the major receives his salary with it too.Leander Bindewald approves that local currencies currently are under spotlight globally. Personally, he works on a project called TradeQoin. The basic principles of the initiative are very simple – a network unites small businesses from all over Europe and they are free to support each other with a credit on advantageous terms (in comparison with traditional credit institutions). The description is similar to a currency:“There is no central authority issuing credit. This gives businesses more liquidity, cheaper credit and makes them less likely to fail.”To succeed in global transformation of the existing system and principles, the alterations have to be made bottom up – from retailers like Tony Benest. Even knowing he follows the news on Bitcoin, it is not making him a devoted supporter of the coin:“Bitcoin probably isn’t quite as convenient for a bit of local shopping. I’ve never even seen one outside of a television set [...] The Brixton Pound is a local gimmick. I don’t think it makes much difference.”He also underlines the differences between global alternative currencies and the Brixton Pound:“The people in Brixton Village are very keen on the Brixton Pound. It’s a bit like a comment I read in an article about Brixton Village: ‘Saving the economy by people selling coffee to each other”.”  This expresses the main goal of local currencies – to support small local businesses that are losing customers due to extraordinary power of chain stores. They do not tend to replace the Sterling Pound, but play a complimentary part to the main currency of the country. They are valued together at party, in case it is differently determined by the owner of the café, shop or stand. The merchant is allowed to make special offers for the holders of the Brixton Pound. It is not a secret that money spent locally, not at a supermarket network spread all over the country circulates longer inside the community, up to three times. The statistics also prove the interest – 170 have signed for the electronic version, but 250 accept the paper form. The transaction fee is only 1,5% (smaller than by other electronic payment methods), no subscription payment or costs exist for the installation of the corresponding POS terminal. Lambeth Council agrees to accept business rates in the local currency. Employees of the local council can obtain their wages in the Brixton Pound. The authority even plans to establish its own currency – the Lambeth Pound. Shakhli values the decision of the authority very high:“The council has been very supportive from the beginning. There is a correlation between a successful Brixton Pound and a successful Brixton in general, so they think it’s been good for the area and want to support it.”Are there many of us that can be proud of their local self-government showing such financial farsightedness to protect local businesses? Feel free to tell us more about Your local experience and share Your position on the matter.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation  
"Japan to Crack Down on Illegal Bitcoin Use, But Delays Regulation",Sabina Laska,5/14/2014 15:34,74,0,"Japan does not want people buying drugs with Bitcoin – but it doesn’t want to regulate the currency either (not yet, anyway).Japanese government officials are looking into ways to monitor illegal transactions paid for in digital currency, but are putting off regulating Bitcoin and its brothers under current law, according to a report by Kyodo News International published Tuesday.Fears about Bitcoin use in criminal activity have come to the forefront of government attention since Japan made its first arrest for alleged drug trafficking using Bitcoin earlier this month. The suspect allegedly paid US$34,500 in Bitcoin to pay for 50 grams of a stimulant drug from Mexican suppliers.Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has been tasked with outlining a strategy for keeping track of illegal Bitcoin activity in concurrence with state police and financial oversight agencies, the report said, citing anonymous sources.Government officials have also clarified their definition of Bitcoin, the report said, declaring it a new type of “value-added electronic record” similar to credit card transactions and electronic fund transfers.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration had previously defined Bitcoin only as a non-currency market product, much like precious metals.The Japanese government is taking a hands-off approach to regulation, the report said, so far only warning consumers that they are responsible for their own trading in Bitcoin.Japan could start collecting consumption taxes on purchases of Bitcoin if it is labeled a new type of investment model, though the report said it was “unlikely” the currency would be subject to capital gains tax on Bitcoin transactions.Authorities across the international community began to research implications and regulation of Bitcoin in earnest over the last year as use of the currency continued to spread, though the sudden collapse of Tokyo-based trader Mt. Gox in February that resulted in the loss of an estimated US$500 million in Bitcoin has made Japanese traders and enthusiasts particularly wary.Governments around the world have issued statements explaining their positions on the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, ranging from permissive to hostile. Research site bitlegal.net has compiled official responses to Bitcoin use organized by country, including the date each summary was posted to avoid confusion about new legislation.  ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #Crimes    #Law  
Russia: Ministry of Communications Requires ICO Issuers To Have $1.7 Mln Nominal Capital,Helen Partz,2/12/2018 23:30,27301,323,"Russia’s Ministry of Communications and Mass Media (Minkomsvyaz) has published a document establishing the licensing rules for ICO projects, Forklog news outlet reported Monday, Feb. 12.Some of the key requirements presented to digital token issuers require nominal capital of about 100 mln rubles - approximately equal to $1.7 mln - and a license for the development, production, and issuance of tokens. Additionally, token issuers are obligated to possess a specially licensed bank account.According to the document, the ICO license will be granted by Minkomsvyaz for a duration of 5 years.In the document Minkomsvyaz defines a digital token as an “encrypted record in a distributed ledger technology (DLT) system which certifies the token’s owner’s right to obtain the initial price of the token from the token’s issuer via a DLT system.”Minkomsvyaz also requires the issuers to provide audited ICO rules including the issuer’s obligations to guarantee the redemption of digital coins on the basis of an irrevocable public offer.The issuance of digital tokens must be completed in Russian rubles via a non-cash settlement. Furthermore, the company that issues the tokens can only direct its profits to maintain obligations to buy back those tokens at a nominal price.Previously on Jan. 25, Russia’s Ministry of Finance introduced a draft of the Digital Assets Regulation Bill which defines and establishes a regulatory system for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, as well mining and trading activities.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tokens  
Israeli Supreme Court Prohibits Banks From Restricting Crypto Activity In Landmark Decision,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/27/2018 13:00,26978,973,"Israel’s Supreme Court has issued a temporary court order prohibiting Leumi Bank from restricting the banking activity of crypto broker Bits of Gold, Finance Magnates reported yesterday, Feb. 26.The Supreme Court’s decision, that has been described as “precedent-setting,” means that banks in general cannot limit accounts associated with the crypto industry.In June 2017, the district judiciary court in Tel Aviv had supported Leumi Bank when Bits of Gold had sought a court order after being denied service by Leumi. The bank had cited an inability for Bitcoin (BTC) transactions to follow Israel’s anti-money laundering laws as the reason for service denial.In December of last year, Leumi Bank also began blocking customer payments to BTC exchanges, citing the Israeli law against gambling and instructions from the Bank of Israel as the cause for stopping these payments to “websites that execute gambling transactions.”After the Feb. 26 Supreme Court decision, this time favorable to Bits of Gold, local news outlet the Globe reported yesterday that Yuval Roash, the CEO of Bits of Gold, said in a statement:“The court’s decision enables us to continue to focus on the base of the crypto community in Israel. We were the first to request the creation of rules for the activity of digital currencies and the first to stand by those rules.”The Judge Anat Baron, who ruled on the case, said since the bank’s decision to terminate Bits of Gold’s account was based on an assumption that violations of the law would take place, the lack of any violations over the past five years supports the decision of undoing those restrictions.However, Baron adds that the court order is “not intended to harm the bank’s rights to analyze with specificity every transaction that takes place with the bank account or to take any actions that are related to minimizing risks, which become transparent through the activities of the company.”The law firm that represented Bits of Gold, Zioni Pillersdorf Philip, said that they are:“Very pleased with the courageous decision of the Supreme Court. This is a precedent-setting decision whose importance can not be overstated in relation to the trading of digital currencies.”Israel has been coming up with guidelines for cryptocurrency regulation in the country in bits and pieces. Israel’s tax authority reported last week that it would consider cryptocurrencies as property in terms of taxes, and in August 2017, the Israeli Securities Authority panel announced that they would potentially begin regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).Also in December of last year, the Israeli government said that they are considering releasing their own national currency tied to the shekel in an effort to limit black market transactions.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Israel    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies    #ICO  
State of New Hampshire Governor Signs Bitcoin MSB Exemption into Law,Anthony Coggine,6/10/2017 0:35,26854,609,"The state of New Hampshire has officially proven itself as one of the Bitcoin-friendly states. On March 9, 2017, the House of Representatives passed a bill that will effectively exempt those using virtual currencies from registering as money transmitters, with Governor Chris Sununu enacting the law on June 2, according to public records.In the past, New Hampshire legislators have also proposed a bill to accept Bitcoin payments in taxes and to completely deregulate Bitcoin.The text of the bill is to exempt “persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency” from the state’s money transmitting regulations.The bill is remarkable since it has strong grassroots of support in the state. However, top regulators have predominantly blasted it during its public hearings. In a hearing held last April, advocates strongly appealed to the legislators to approve the measure, while the other party, representatives from the state’s banking and justice department, wanted it to be abolished.State lawmakers were divided by the bill and it was witnessed during the vote held last March.The House of Representatives held an 185-170 margin and in April, when the measure was raised to the Senate, public records show that it passed with a vote of 13-10. The legislation will come into effect on August 1, 2017.Meanwhile, there’s still uncertainty about the future of Bitcoins in the US. On March 11, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. Yet, instead of losing its value, it grew stronger and went confidently high. Due to the recent turn of events, they have decided to review the rejection.Recently, the state of Montana provided funds to a local Bitcoin mining project as a part of its efforts to boost employment in the region. In New Hampshire, the governor signed a bill that excludes digital currency traders from the state’s money transmitting rules.With an increasing interest in Bitcoin, investors are keeping tabs on how laws and policies around the world are being shaped by Blockchain technology. In fact, the Australian government believes that it will have a profound impact on the country’s economy.In addition, Japan recently approved Bitcoin as a legal form of payment on April 1, 2017. Japan is the third largest economy in the world, based on gross national product, and such recognition and acceptance of the digital currency will, in turn, further strengthen the trustworthiness and credibility of Bitcoin. This domino effect has meant that Blockchain technology has given greater credibility to its digital currencies.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #US Government  
Notes from FATF’s Private Sector Consultation,Malleya Stripe,3/28/2014 14:18,51,0,"Jim Harper, Global Policy CounselI was in Brussels this week for a “private sector consultative forum” organized by FATF, the Financial Action Task Force. FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 “to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.”One of the sessions was on “risks and regulatory approaches to virtual currency.” My goal was simply to learn the thinking of this group and make myself available to participants who were interested in Bitcoin. Learning about Bitcoin helps one appreciate Bitcoin, of course. I now have business cards and plans for follow-up with regulators, bankers, and other financial services providers on every continent.The opening general session was an opportunity for regulated parties—banks and others—to air their views about anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing rules. They were more forthcoming than I expected about the difficulties they face implementing regulations whose source is the FATF’s recommendations. Again and again, participants talked about the “de-risking” they were undertaking in order to stay within the rules.“De-risking”—a fascinating word choice—means something like “eliminating clients and business lines that are too risky.” It’s a bloodless way of saying that there are certain countries, for example, that they feel they must cut off from the financial services system. The irony—no, the shame if it—is that excluding entire nations from access to financial services keeps even worthy people within those borders relatively poor. It starves these countries’ economies, and it prevents them from developing institutions like police forces and judicial systems that operate under the rule of law.Along with the injustice (in my opinion) of keeping honest, hard-working people in poverty because of where they live, financial “de-risking” may contribute to environments that produce hopelessness, criminality (including crimes associated with money laundering), political radicalism, and in some cases terrorism. “De-risking” may well be risky!Of course, “de-risking” doesn’t only apply to countries. Certain business lines are perceived as too risky, and it may be that digital currencies are still one of them. Thus “de-risking” may thwart financial services innovations with fantastic potential consumer benefits and job-creating potential.Which brings us to another word choice: “virtual currency,” the topic of the session I was most interested in. The word “virtual” has increasingly come to mean “on a computer or the Internet,” but its longstanding meaning is: “very close to being something without actually being it” or: “being such in essence or effect though not formally recognized or admitted.” The word “virtual” serves in part to deny the legitimacy of Bitcoin.This was not intended by the organizers of that session or the FATF, but it is a habit of language that reflects habits of mind with which I disagree. Bitcoin is very real. Indeed, the reason why it is of interest to the FATF is its real (if potential) influence on things within the ambit of that organization’s members.I call Bitcoin a “digital currency” because this distinguishes it from analog currencies, which are most recognized as some kind of physical item, such as rectangular pieces of paper or cylinders of metal. While people continue to call Bitcoin a “virtual currency,” they will tend to think that the system based on paper and metal bits is “real” while the fully digital system is not.I hope to bring the people I met in Brussels to the view that Bitcoin is real. I’ll try to educate these important figures in the world of financial services about Bitcoin and bring them to a more favorable view. There is no question that everyone involved in FATF wants a better world for all. Bitcoin is a tool we can use to achieve that, and it’s worth the risk to try.Bitcoin Foundation",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Foundation

Roger Ver: 2017 Will Be the Best Year for Bitcoin,Frisco d'Anconia,12/30/2016 13:40,1392,806,"With Bitcoin price rising like an eagle, albeit a slight slump on Christmas, it ricocheted back impressively heading to $1000.In fact, next month is precisely eight good years since the first Bitcoin block was mined.  In less than a week, the price rose more than 12 percent and looking at some factors the prospects in 2017 are all auspicious. Bitcoin experts believe that the current trend of an upward adjustment for the pioneer cryptocurrency will continue unabated in 2017.Roger Ver, also known as Bitcoin Jesus, and owner of Bitcoin.com holds the belief that there is good reason to think that 2017 will be the best year for Bitcoin. In an interview with Cointelegraph, the astute crypto investor was very optimistic that the best thing that ever happened to Bitcoin will occur in 2017.For a couple of years now, the Crypto Community is eagerly waiting for the green light for a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) to usher Bitcoin into the financial mainstream. However, this has been elusive even though not impossible. It will be recalled that the Winklevoss twins filed for an ETF with the SEC in mid-2013.Many are of the view that if ETF becomes a reality in 2017, the industry will see the best of its times. Nevertheless, others are of the opinion that this won’t see the light of the day. Yet Roger firmly believes this will be possible in 2017, and it will lead to unprecedented positive consequences for Bitcoin.“It has been possible from day one, but the regulators have delayed it, and denied the ability of mln of people to easily participate in the Bitcoin economy via financial instruments that they are already familiar with.”The biggest trial for Bitcoin at the moment and something that saw an intense discussion with passion throughout 2016 is the Bitcoin blocksize. Alas, just a few days to end the year and no concrete agreements are in sight. A slow transaction is pushing many people and businesses to integrate alternative cryptocurrencies.To Roger Ver whether a hard fork in 2017 is possible is a tough question to answer. “This is the $15 bln question. I wish I had a definite answer for you, but we just don’t know yet. It is also worth noting that a hard fork is just another name for a protocol upgrade,” the Bitcoin early adopter humorously pointed out.Even though the community has optimistic expectations for Bitcoin in the coming year, the fact remains that the issue of the block size is still retrogressive to the ecosystem. All is not gloomy since there are solutions like Bitcoin Unlimited, SegWit and others that have been offered as a solution.On the other hand, the rise in Bitcoin’s price has also created an apprehension of hackers striking exchanges. Bitfinex lost $70 mln this year after it was hacked as a result of a faulty multi-signature.Community members are concerned that the hacking of Bitcoin Exchanges could lead to a lower price rate and dissuade people from Bitcoin, but Roger expressed a different opinion that is far from the general outlook.""Since no single exchange has a significant market share at this point, I don’t think individual exchange hackings are likely to have any long-term effect on the price,"" Roger eloquently countered.One noticeable trend in 2016 is the manner in which governments around the world have made a u-turn on Bitcoin offering to legalize it and then regulate. Countries like Russia and Vietnam after years of outlawing Satoshi shamelessly admitted it is unstoppable and rescinded such a position.Refreshingly Japan also announced it would soon scrap the sales tax on Bitcoin transactions and purchases. The move was welcomed news for the Bitcoin community in the Asian Tiger Country.Will 2017 see more regulations from the nation state over Bitcoin? Roger Ver, as usual, has something prudent for you in 2017 and beyond: ""Of course. That’s what governments do. In the end, though, it will be Bitcoin that regulates governments, not the other way around.""",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Roger Ver    #ETF    #Bitcoin Block Size    #Security  
"US to Weaken Regulations for Digital Currencies, Blockchain by 2017",Joseph Young,11/9/2016 11:15,1345,375,"The US government has called for the formation of a “responsible innovation” fintech department to spur the growth of emerging technologies including cryptocurrencies, the Blockchain technology and other financial technologies that could enhance existing financial systems.US regulatory body the Office of the Controller of the Currency (OCC), which previously expressed their optimism towards digital currencies and the Blockchain technology, is planning to launch three offices in Washington, New York and San Francisco led by a chief innovation officer.The 30th Comptroller of the Currency of the United States, Thomas J. Curry, stated:""The OCC supports responsible innovation that enhances the safety and soundness of the federal banking system, treats customers fairly and promotes financial inclusion [...] we are ensuring that institutions with federal charters have a regulatory framework that is receptive to responsible innovation.""While it is still difficult to speculate the impact of the OCC’s plans on Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies, it will hugely affect the operations of Blockchain and distributed ledger startups that are collaborating with banks and major financial institutions.The OCC states that the formation of a responsible innovation department will allow the organization to ""identify, understand and respond to financial innovation affecting the federal banking system.”Thus, Blockchain startups that are developing efficient financial systems and decentralized infrastructure for the American financial industry, will benefit from favorable regulations and workable policies.More importantly, Curry noted that the primarily purpose of the fintech innovation department is to assist the central bank and other financial institutions based in the US to adopt and embrace emerging financial technologies such as the Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.""These changes challenge traditional banking business models. Although banks have a long history of adapting to new technologies and introducing innovative products and services, it is imperative for them to understand the impact of the evolving landscape,” added Curry.However, the official paper released by the Office of the Controller of the Currency suggests that the innovation department will look closely into the preference of the general population and consumers. It further emphasizes the importance of non-bank financial service providers such as Bitcoin exchanges and service providers, which have demonstrated significant growth over the past few years.“Technological advances, together with evolving consumer preferences, are reshaping the financial services industry at an accelerated pace. Over the last several years, a large and growing number of nonbank financial technology companies have emerged to provide financial products and services through alternative platforms and delivery channels,” the paper read.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Blockchain News    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies    #Startups  
UK Government Grants Permission to Issue Blockchain-Based Currency,Joseph Young,2/12/2017 12:54,1337,1738,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulatory body of the UK government, granted local London-based Blockchain startup Tramonex a Small Electronic Money Institution (EMI) registration, effectively allowing the launch of a Blockchain-based currency within the UK.The approval of Tramonex marks the first case of a Blockchain technology company receiving an EMI authorization from the FCA.In 2011, the FCA released the Electronic Money Regulations to provide certain financial service providers and institutions the ability to operate as a money transmission firm and payment facilitator. To be approved by the FCA and obtain an EMI authorization, a company must be fully compliant with local regulations, security requirements and reporting and notification requirements.In order to remain as an EMI-authorized company within the UK, a startup needs to allocate a significant amount of resources and capital to ensure none of its operations are in conflict with the regulations imposed by the FCA.Once an EMI authorization is granted, a startup can begin to issue, distribute and redeem e-money. That means a Blockchain startup like Tramonex can issue a legal Blockchain-based currency, facilitate payments, launch applications or service on top of its infrastructure.While users can be assured of the legality of Tramonex’s Blockchain-based services and payment networks, one limitation of an EMI-authorized operator’s financial services is the lack of financial privacy.Under the FCA’s requirements, EMI-licensed startups are required to provide regular “reporting information” to comply with the FCA’s supervisory and reporting obligations. Although the type of information is not specified, the FCA could ask startups to submit any form of data that the agency may need, such as financial information and personal details of users.Although Marc Avedissian, co-founder of Tramonex Labs, assures users of strict regulatory compliance and cheap transactions, the monthly report requirement of the FCA could result in the elimination of user privacy.Avedissian stated:“Automation of payments using the Blockchain and smart contracts will reduce the costs of transactions, allowing for the adaptation of this solution across many different fields such as insurance, real estate and government, to name only a few. Previously, the missing link was a lack of regulation – Tramonex Labs is very proud to provide a regulated environment where digital payments can be executed in a secure and transparent way.”Still, the approval of Tramonex as an EMI company is an optimistic sign for the Blockchain industry in the UK. In the future, if an increasing number of Blockchain firms and developers secure regulatory licenses from the government, they will be able to operate under a more transparent and regulatory viable ecosystem.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #London    #United Kingdom    #Startups  
"Vietnam to Legalize, Regulate Bitcoin",Frisco d'Anconia,12/6/2016 13:46,1247,1189,"Vietnam is set to join the growing list of nations that have legitimized Bitcoin. In the latest move, the government of the South East Asian country hinted at sanctioning virtual currencies, including Bitcoin.In a proposal, the Vietnamese authorities revealed that the lack of a legal framework regulating virtual currencies is robbing the country of investments.More so, just like the unfounded fear of many other governments that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are a conduit for money laundering, smuggling, terrorism and tax evasion, they believe that the only means of curbing these harmful elements is through acceptance and regulation.Authorities are confident that confusion and criminal activities related to virtual currencies in Vietnam originate from the lack of existing legal framework and the regulatory environment.The Vietnamese government’s recognition of the benefits of virtual currencies is a positive development. In fact, its statement acknowledges that Bitcoin offers people the opportunity to undertake fast, convenient and lower cost transactions devoid of counterfeiting making businesses efficient and profitable. The government is therefore poised to avail these benefits to its people by ensuring a legal and regulatory framework is in place.At the moment the government wants to streamline the industry so as to be able to tax, monitor and eliminate any so-called negative impacts. It intends to protect users from swindlers and any other significant ramifications that the use of virtual currencies poses. All directions point to a Vietnamese state that is poised to bring Bitcoin and other digital currencies to the mainstream.However, the government’s sudden change of heart towards cryptocurrency may also point to their inability to ban and prevent the citizens of Vietnam from using them. It will be recalled that the Bank of Vietnam in 2014 banned Bitcoin and named the Dong as the only means of payment singling out Bitcoin as a threat to the country.This directive did not deter the populace from using Bitcoin. It resulted in Bitcoin exchanges springing up to serve the needs of the people to hold satoshi. Vietnam now has 2.2 mln electronic wallets. The possibility the government has given up in restraining Bitcoin use and to have a share of the cake is glaring.",3,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Vietnam    #Government  
Hong Kong Announces Bitcoin will Remain Deregulated in Wake of MyCoin Collapse,Charlie Richards,3/25/2015 12:40,1182,0,"Secretary of the Financial Services of Hong Kong, Professor KC Chan announces no intention to specifically regulate cryptocurrencies.Speaking during a session of the Legislative Council, Chan read out a statement that the government does not see a need to regulate the digital currency sector beyond the existing anti-fraud controls already in place.The opinion is based on the small number of vendors who accept bitcoin as a payment. The Financial Services body therefore continues to consider it as a virtual commodity.“There are only a very small number of vendors claiming that they would accept bitcoins as a medium of payment. We therefore consider that bitcoins and other kinds of virtual commodities do not qualify to be an e-currency, having regard to their nature and current circulation in Hong Kong.”“As such, the Government does not consider it necessary to introduce at the moment new legislation to regulate trading in such virtual commodities or prohibit people from participating in such activities.”The Secretary explored the subjects further in answer to the initial question, justifying the lack of specific monetary controls on virtual commodity sector, with the following analysis:“It is also unlikely that bitcoins, given its circulation, will pose a significant threat on Hong Kong's financial system.”The subject arose after an executive council member asked for a government response to the collapse of the MyCoin digital currency exchange in February. Up to 3,000 investors are believed to have lost in the region of US$23.2 million in the fraud, although some earlier estimates had placed this figure as high as US$386 million.Policy in mainland China remains opaque towards Bitcoin, with a government ban on bitcoin transactions for banks, retailers and payment firms, despite steady growth in the Bitcoin sector itself. Digital currency trading volumes in the country have continued to grow, with one report finding BTC-CNY transactions accounting for 80% of total global trading.The Hong Kong statement goes on to describe the normal financial controls that exchanges and financial services are already subject to such as “money changing or remittance services [being] required to apply to the Commissioner of Customs and Excise for a ‘money service operator’ license.”This hands-off approach by the Hong Kong administration could therefore be seen as a move to remain reasonably in-line with Chinese policy, where Bitcoin is also considered to be a virtual commodity. A recent move to increase start-up venture capital investment on the mainland though, may be the first indication of more favorable policy on the horizon.Hong Kong has existed as a Special Administrative Region of China since the 1997 handover from British control. This means the island is able to draft its own regulations and basic law, although in practice, the powerful pro-Beijing lobby ensures that policy remains largely in-line with the direction of mainland China.Did you enjoy this article?

The government will formally consult on the proposed regulatory approach early in the next Parliament”The government's public call for opinions last November was answered by a wide range of over 120 enthusiasts, start-ups, security experts, academics, and established financial institutions. Publishing a wide range of opinions from this group, the report comes across as rounded and well-informed.The announcement coincides with the UK's spring budget in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne promised that: “we [will] take steps to promote competition, back fintech [Financial Technologies], and encourage new business like global re-insurance.” The UK’s government has solidified their plans for digital currencies.Both the Chancellor and the Bank of England have shown an increased interest and enthusiasm for digital currencies over the last two months, with the Bank issuing a favorable report, and Osborne tweeting his backing.Good that @bankofengland looking into digital currencies – need to ensure UK customers benefit from new tech and #Fintech firms flourishCointelegraph spoke to Danial Daychopan, founder of London-based exchange and merchant payment provider LazyCoins, for his reaction to the possible regulations:“Don’t rush to legislate – Understand the specific nuances of decentralized payment systems and work with companies to overcome the current security challenges. In time, we’ll have a better understanding of which regulations are required and which will work. And most importantly, give the technology time to create industry solutions.The UK is in an almost unique position to benefit. London in particular is ideal for Bitcoin start-ups, with creative and technical skills sitting side by side with elite financial services expertise.At LazyCoins we anticipated new legislation will be brought forward at some stage in the UK, so we have stayed a step ahead by already obtaining a Money Services Business License, and following a strict AML/KYC[Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer] verification process.”Over at another London crypto start-up, Elliptic analyst Nathan Jessop has been examining the news from the Treasury. We asked him for his reaction to the report.“The Treasury Response represents very encouraging progress in several key areas: Anti-Money Laundering, consumer protection, and technical standardization. Prioritizing AML will bring much-needed legitimacy and clarity to the industry, and hopefully encourage banks to engage more with digital currency businesses. Furthermore, allowing the industry to develop its own consumer protection and technical standards will promote collaboration and innovation much more efficiently than top-down regulation. Elliptic is fully aligned behind these initiatives. In fact, we have been actively developing compliance tools to directly address the Treasury's AML concerns. As founding members of the UKDCA, we look forward to working with the industry to promote consumer protection and technical standards.”The report calls for any regulations on the sector to be discussed in the next parliament alongside a formal consultation.

Erik Voorhees, Shapeshift Founder and CEO, told CNBC:""We either would have to do something we're not comfortable with, or leave New York. It's a moral and ethical stand we're going take.""Voorhees has decided not to to comply with the BitLicense, explaining that ShapeShift is not willing to take the risk of exposing its users’ personal information, leaving them susceptible to potential data breaches or hacking attacks. The exchange is known for its ease of use because it doesn’t require users to create accounts.The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) responded to ShapeShift’s announcement. Their spokesman stated:“We always recognized that there is going to be some part of this community that is against even pretty standard financial regulatory oversight measures, such as anti-money laundering controls and other consumer protections. That said, one digital currency company has already received a license from NYDFS and a number of others have stated they intend to seek BitLicenses shortly. Ultimately, we believe that prudent regulation will be important to building greater consumer confidence in digital currency and sparking wider adoption.”Voorhees pointed out the ""epidemic"" of identity theft. He said:“Identity theft is ... more costly to society than many other forms of theft and crime. It is pervasive because the antiquated financial system — based on credit cards and banks — only works when personal information is attached to your transaction. Bitcoin has finally solved this problem, by enabling 100% secure transactions without attaching your private information. Now, New York wants to mandate that consumers continue to be put at risk, even though technology has provided a solution.”In response, he announced the creation of a new website campaign called PleaseProtectConsumers.org.

Italy Wants to Treat Bitcoin as Currency And Tax It,Amelia Tomasicchio,9/12/2016 18:06,1089,385,"On September 2, Agenzia delle Entrate, the major Italian tax authority, published a new document titled “Bitcoin and digital currencies buying and selling: clarification on the tax treatment” about the fiscal treatment of Bitcoin and how VAT would be applied to digital currency transactions.The document states:“Traditional currency intermediary activities made with virtual currencies held by market participants are exempt from VAT, as they are among the transactions related to banknotes and coins.”In Italy there are several places where you can use Bitcoin as a method of payment. From tennis clubs to painters, from bed and breakfast to lawyers, you can buy everything you need with Bitcoin, especially in the tourist and computer fields.The document specifies different rules according to the kind of users: individuals and companies. In line with recent guidelines of the EU Court of Justice, the resolution makes it clear that for individual users holding Bitcoin outside of a business activity, these are spot transactions which do not generate taxable income because it lacks speculative purpose.Business consultant and tax advisor Antonello Gaviraghi explained to Cointelegraph:“About the gains of individual users, this resolution specifies that they are not taxed because they have no speculative purpose. However, this interpretation is to be applied also to the detention of Bitcoin in relatively small amounts. Incomes from transactions made by individuals on a currency become taxable when the total stock of all the foreign currency deposited in accounts held is greater than 51.645,69 euro for at least 7 days, using for the calculation of the stock the current exchange rate prevailing at the beginning of the reporting period, or January 1st.”Instead of individuals, the Agenzia delle Entrate resolution specifies that  revenues - coming from intermediation in the purchase and the sale of Bitcoins - are subject to IRAS and IRAP, net of related costs.To evaluate the Bitcoins held by the company at end of the year it is necessary to consider the normal value, or their prices at that time. For this reason, Gaviraghi explains that this resolution is a disadvantage for business, because companies will have to pay tax on unrealized capital gains or losses.He notes:“Any unrealized capital gains or losses, arising from the difference between the purchase cost and the evaluation at the end of the year will be subject to capital gain taxation. This is is a serious disadvantage for companies who hold Bitcoins for their activities, who will have to pay taxes on profits not yet realized, but only estimated.”",4,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taxes    #Italy  
"Bitcoin Exchange Coin.mx Opereator Released on $75,000 Bond",Joseph Young,11/16/2016 10:55,1076,154,"A second Tampa Bay man has been charged for conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting venture. Ricardo Hill, one of the nine men allegedly linked to the JPMorgan data breach in 2014, was released on a $75,000 bond.Last week, Hill appeared at a Manhattan court to settle various charges filed against him for operating an unregulated Bitcoin exchange. Hill admitted he was aware of the fact that his Bitcoin exchange, Coin.mx, processed transactions involving the victims of the JP Morgan security breach.Considering Hill’s statement, the court ruled Hill to be guilty and noted that Hill and other operators of Coin.mx, including Anthony Murgio, profited from the transactions that victims settled on in order to access their files compromised during the attack.While Hill was not directly involved with the security breach and hacking of JP Morgan’s database and computers, the court and prosecutors stated that Hill played an important role as a middleman in transferring money between the victims and the ransomware developers.To date, Hill is the second person within the Tampa Bay region to be charged with conspiracy and money laundering charges for operating a Bitcoin exchange, and the ninth man to be prosecuted for the JP Morgan data breach case.Hill’s partner, Anthony Murgio, who was also the main operator of Coin.mx, pleaded not guilty to his charges and is set to face trial in early 2017.This case, which involves JP Morgan, its victims and nine linked alias from the Coin.mx exchange, is being extended for another year, as Murgio will appear at a New York court to dispute the charges and defend his claims.While prosecutors and the FBI accused Coin.mx of running other criminal activities other than that seen in the JP Morgan case, not enough evidence was produced to charge the operators.The FBI also stated that even if Murgio, Hill and others did not intend to process transactions for the hackers, the mere fact that the operators failed to contact authorities and law enforcement for suspicious activities can be used to charge individuals for money laundering.The FBI stated:“Murgio and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, Murgio never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.”Ultimately, if major Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms fail to stay on par with local KYC/AML policies and regulatory frameworks, money laundering and conspiracy charges may be filed against the operators. Thus, to prevent conflict with the law enforcement, complying with KYC/AML regulations is crucial.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Coin.mx    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Money Laundering    #JPMorgan    #KYC  
"With Financial Restrictions Over, Bitcoin is to Unleash Full Potential in Argentina",Adam Dubove,10/8/2016 13:12,1042,836,"It was October 2011, and amid a downward spiral of economic decline, then Argentinean President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner announced stringent restrictions to buy foreign currency and to send money overseas.For the next four years, the media widely reported how financial repression made some Argentineans to adopt the cryptocurrency as an escape route from government controls. Conventional wisdom held that Bitcoin was thriving due to the pervasive regulations in force.However, five years later, financial repression is mostly part of the past. In December 2015, the conservative candidate Mauricio Macri was elected president and he quickly reversed the monetary restrictions. The new context made most people wonder if the momentum for Bitcoin in the South American country has come.Despite battling the arrival of Uber in the country and keeping tax rates high, Macri administration presents itself as a business-friendly government and its officials have repeatedly boasted about the important role of entrepreneurs and startups in the economy.Far from unfounded speculations, Bitcoin entrepreneurs knew the cryptocurrency came to stay. For them, they say, this is just the beginning. “Bitcoin is not a tool to avoid taxes or wage a guerrilla-style, economic war against a corrupt government subjugating” a whole country, Nubis Bruno, managing partner of Bitex.la SRL, a Bitcoin exchange and remittances company, told Cointelegraph: “It’s better to regard it as a solution to the structural problems of the financial system.”Bruno said the large local Bitcoin community wasn’t born out of economic restrictions, but the Argentineans’ love-story with Bitcoin has more to do with its idiosyncrasy. “Argentina is a large producer of technological early adopters, user communities, and our DNA is bi-monetary,” he explains.Yet, Bitcoin has a long way to go for Argentineans. Argentina hosts the largest Bitcoin community in Latin America, and is home to dozens of entrepreneurs that have launched diverse startups, but the volume at the exchanges is minimum “especially when compared to other countries without a community of Bitcoin enthusiasts,” Bruno added.At SatoshiTango, a Buenos Aires-based Bitcoin exchange, doubts arose over the future of Bitcoin after the government lifted currency controls. However, they quickly realized that their situation was going to improve, SatoshiTango Co-founder Matías Bari said.For Bari, the removal of currency controls are good news for Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is most used in countries with no financial repression, no controls,” he says. “And having an economy in order is better for business.”?Nine months into Macri presidency, Bari says they “haven’t seen a decline neither in the number of users signing up to our platform nor the volume of transactions”.“We saw an increase in volume and number of companies operating with Bitcoin after the removal of currency controls,” Bruno confirmed.Over a hundred shops and professionals accept Bitcoins in Buenos Aires, according to Coinmap, including dentists, law firms, cafes, and bed and breakfasts, but still most of Bitcoin users are independent professionals and companies using the cryptocurrency for international transfers. “This became useful after the government lifted the restrictions,” says Bruno.“While some people that were attracted to Bitcoin due to the financial repression may have stopped using the currency, most have stuck around,” Bari says. “Even if they initially used it for circumventing restrictions, they have found advantages in other aspects of Bitcoin besides transferring money.”Both Bruno and Bari concurred that the government has opened its doors to Bitcoin entrepreneurs and are in no way hostile to the digital currency, unlike its colleagues of Ecuador and Bolivia, where Bitcoin is banned.“They find Bitcoin an interesting technology, and are looking forward to seeing how local businesses can make the most of it,” Bruno said.SatoshiTango, for their part, were invited to meet officials from the Ministry of Production. “They call us to let them know if we needed anything,” Bari says. “We are already on a more advanced stage, but for someone starting a company is great this kind of attention.”Last month, Central Bank First Deputy Governor Lucas Liach took part in a Bitcoin panel and expressed mixed opinions on the cryptocurrency, but said they were interested in “adopting the Blockchain technology” for the monetary authority.In November, Argentina will become once again the epicenter of all things Bitcoin as an all-star roster of international speakers prepares to turn up at the fourth Latin American Bitcoin Conference to be held once again in the country.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Argentina    #SatoshiTango  
France to Tighten Regulations for Financial Instruments Including Cryptocurrencies,Joseph Young,5/9/2015 16:55,1001,0,"French Finance Minister Michel Sapin has announced increased control of “the use of cash in France.” Starting from September 2015, French daily Le Parisien reports, all cash transfers will be monitored, leading mostly likely to cryptocurrency regulations being tightened.The restrictions proposed by Sapin planned to take effect this September will include a 1000-euro limit on cash payments and mandatory reporting by banks of accounts which exceed 10,000 euros per month to the Money Laundering Authority TRACFIN. Regulations will also be refocused for “financial instruments that escape the oversight of the financial system,” Forex Magnates reports.Le Parisien did not provide specific information on the alleged “regulations” as they pertain to financial instruments. However, rumors suggest that the transactions of digital currencies will be regulated, conforming as they do to the aforementioned type of “financial instruments.”Most likely, the regulations will heavily focus on the purchase of Bitcoin using cash and income tax for cryptocurrency transactions, as the French Ministry of Economy and Finance announced last year - “All taxpayers are required to declare all their revenues, including those originating from abroad. This said, there is a certain tolerance [from the state authorities] regarding minor and irregular revenues, for instance from occasional sales.”Ironically in July 2014, Sapin had given a speech on Bitcoin regulations, explaining that France was not interested in enforcing strict regulations on Bitcoin transactions. Following the statement, a report titled “Regulation in the face of innovation: public authorities and the development of virtual currencies” was released by the French Senate in August 2014, which was discussed between committee president Philippe Marini and Senate member Francois Marc.Reported by Cointelegraph, the document stated that the technology ""can no longer be disregarded by public authorities"" and, despite the risks, ""Bitcoin offers multiple opportunities for the future, both as payment system and, above all, as a decentralized validation protocol.""Sapin’s attempt to regulate financial instruments may have arisen from a possibility that major financial instruments such as Bitcoin could challenge the Euro, or at least act as an alternative currency in France. This is not an overly optimistic statement after all, as the Bitcoin industry in France has been growing consistently over the past few years.On April 22, 2014, CoinDesc reported that Europe’s first Bitcoin center named La Maison du Bitcoin (The House of Bitcoin) was set to open in May that year. Today, the center offers co-working spaces and assistance for Bitcoin companies, along with workshops, hackathons, meetups and a Lamassu Bitcoin ATM.Four months after the opening of La Maison du Bitcoin, French Startup MineOnCloud installed the nation’s third Bitcoin ATM manufactured by BitXatm, the same ATM manufacturer Canada’s largest Vitcoin exchange QuadrigaCX partnered with last month.The active Vitcoin meetup (Paris Bitcoin Meetup) and community of startups managed to increase Bitcoin awareness in Paris, which encouraged more than 50 merchants (registered in Coinmap.org) to accept Bitcoin. However, heavy regulations on Bitcoin exchanges have substantially slowed the potential growth of the Bitcoin industry in France.Reported by Reuters on 7 July, 2014, French police raided a home of one of the founders of a supposed “illegally run Bitcoin exchange” and seized 388 BTC, worth US$200,000 at the time.Olivier Caracotch, prosecutor in the town of Foix explained, “It's the first time in Europe that a judicial action has resulted in the closure of an illegal exchange for virtual currency.”The Bitcoin industry in France has great potential, especially with the support for Vitcoin startups and traders provided by La Maison Du Bitcoin and the Paris Bitcoin Meetup, which currently has more than 700 members. However, heavy regulations on Bitcoin transactions and exchanges in France make it extremely difficult for any type of Bitcoin business to run in the country.With the aforementioned regulations and the control of financial instruments by the French Government set to be “tightened” this September, it becomes even harder to speculate on the future of Bitcoin startups, exchanges and traders in France.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #France    #Finance    #Cryptocurrencies    #Economy  
US State of Illinois Prepares to Regulate Blockchain Industry,Joseph Young,7/4/2017 17:30,20891,686,"Legislators of the state of Illinois, have officially advanced a bill to establish a government task force to regulate the Blockchain industry and sector.House Resolution 120, which was approved with 98 votes, requests the government to create an inter-governmental Blockchain task force to provide a more efficient and regulatory-friendly ecosystem for Blockchain development firms, research organizations and businesses.The bill entitled “Blockchain Task Force” read:“Creates the Illinois Legislative Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force to study how and if the State of Illinois, county governments, and municipal governments can benefit from a transition to a Blockchain-based system for recordkeeping and service delivery.”Since January of this year, the government of Illinois has been attempting to evaluate and understand Blockchain technology or distributed ledger technology to provide a better ecosystem for businesses working with the technology to automate certain processes, supply chains and operations.In March, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations also joined the R3 Consortium, better known as R3CEV, in order to better comprehend Blockchain technology and its intricacies. However, it remains unclear whether the government agency will remain within R3CEV since the company has shifted from the development of Blockchain technology to distributed ledger technology-inspired platforms such as R3 Corda.In an official blog post, R3 CEO David Rutter wrote:“While we were almost certainly guilty of slipping into this semantics trap now and again, we’ve said from the beginning that Corda is a distributed ledger platform, not a traditional Blockchain platform. It was never designed to be one.”If the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations remains within the R3 Consortium, it will be likely to evaluate how other consortia are working with Blockchain-inspired technologies to optimize the global banking system.The bill also requires the Illinois Blockchain task force to present a report on the Blockchain and distributed ledger industries by January of 2018, to the General Assembly. Findings and recommendations will be made to the General Assembly and based on that report. The US federal government will likely decide whether to regulate the Blockchain sector further or leave it to grow at an exponential rate and allow Blockchain businesses to innovate the technology further.Previously, Cointelegraph reported that some of the largest banks in the world including Goldman Sachs have begun to perceive the true potential of Blockchain technology in the traditional finance sector.In a report entitled “Goldman Sachs Finally Recognizes the Power of Blockchain Technology,” Cointelegraph revealed that Goldman Sachs believes Blockchain offers a transparent, efficient and secure infrastructure for data processing and transaction settlement.As the US government takes an interest in the Blockchain sector and companies continue to develop Blockchain-based applications, the industry will likely experience explosive growth in terms of commercial implementation and roll out.",4,  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies  
Bitcoin Price Booming but Global Demand Takes Hit From Regulations,Darryn Pollock,10/13/2017 11:35,20333,635,"Digital currencies, especially Bitcoin as it reaches a new all time high, are stronger than ever - this in the face of governmental regulation and hardline crackdowns.However, although Bitcoin’s price seems unaffected by the control that Russia and China is trying to wrest from the decentralized digital currency ecosystem, trading volume and global demand has taken a hit.Looking at a graph of the Bitcoin price it would be hard to find an influence of major factors such as the Chinese ban on exchanges, and the recent Russian ban on access to exchanges.However, looking at a graph that illustrates the share of trading by currency, there are some noticeable swings. These swings indicate the high volatility that comes with cryptocurrencies, more than just in price.From the graph above, the Chinese yuan was competing with Bitcoin for the share of trading, but as regulation in China started to gain traction in the early part of this year, Bitcoin quickly took over as it boomed.Recent regulations have seen the yuan shrink further as others, like Korea and the US, take larger shares.Bitcoin trading against the Chinese yuan used to account for most of the volume. That changed early this year when regulators started to clamp down on digital currency exchanges. Japan’s yen took over as the biggest trading pair, as regulators there took the opposite approach, adopting digital-friendly rules.In the case of Ethereum, the Korean won has become prevalent, as rules that limit access to more traditional assets are driving Korean investors to mine and trade the second-biggest cryptocurrency. As for trading in a wider group of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin takes the place of fiat currencies as the biggest trading pair.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #Russia    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #Cryptocurrencies    #China    #North Korea    #South Korea  
Bitcoin Mining Looks Ready to Fall Under Russian Regulations,Darryn Pollock,10/13/2017 8:40,20297,360,"A few months ago, the talk was that Russia was actually looking to subsidize mining costs. However, that seems to have been a ploy to perhaps gain control over miners and get them to register with the government for more than just protection from money laundering.Bitcoin mining in Russia has long operated in a ‘legal grey area’, thanks to lack of regulation, as well as reasonable electricity, which has made home-mining operations possible and profitable.However, with Russia’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrencies, through the banning of access to exchanges, the iron-fisted government is also taking aim at miners.Russian President Vladimir Putin called for regulation of cryptocurrencies at a meeting with top financial officials Tuesday, warning about the “serious risks” they bear. The Finance Ministry proposed to allow mining only for businesses and private entrepreneurs that would register with the government, to reduce the risk of money laundering.Contrarily, a report indicated that the government, through the Institute for Internet Development (IRI) and the Russian Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (RABIK), had laid out plans to make electricity costs lower for Russian Bitcoin miners.However, that seems to have been a ploy to perhaps gain control over miners and get them to register with the government for more than just protection from money laundering.Of course, despite hard-nosed crackdowns from Russia and China recently, there are many who believe regulation is the way forward for cryptocurrencies, and in Russia there is a movement for turning mining into a legal endeavour.Arseniy Scheltsin, the director of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain (Racib), a Kremlin-backed lobby group said: “This way of making money suits the national mentality well. Russian fairy tale heroes tend to laze around while their job does itself magically.”Scheltson is leading a push for further subsidies and lower electricity tariffs for crypto miners, which he believes will lead to miners being more transparent and in line with the law, including tax laws.“This would allow a global competence center to develop and increase Russia’s influence over the functioning of leading virtual currencies,” he said.Russia’s push to understand cryptocurrencies further came when the President met with Ethereum’s 23-year-old creator Vitalik Buterin, calling for deployment of a digital economy in Russia to diversify the nation away from a reliance on oil and gas.Russia’s move towards a digital economy seems to becoming a reality as state interest has hit a new level, and the control of such assets has come along with it. Regulating the access to exchanges, and now controlling the mining, would see Russia taking the lead in terms of governments trying to control the decentralized crypto world.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Mining    #Russia    #Putin    #Government    #Vitalik Buterin  
Bitcoin Completely Unregulated in the US As Obscure Nixon-Era Law Came to Light,Joël Valenzuela,4/1/2017 9:51,2405,315,"A US federal judge ruled Friday that cryptocurrency is completely exempt from regulation due to a little-known law enacted over 40 years ago.HB 1010, known as the Monopoly Act, exempts imitation money, such as novelty items or those used in board games, from falling under government jurisdiction for financial regulation. Under the new interpretation of the law, this has been expanded to include cryptocurrencies.The Monopoly Act was introduced with the intent of preventing the imitation money, used in board games such as Monopoly, from falling under government scrutiny.Parker Brothers, the company behind Monopoly, lobbied heavily for the law to pass, as imitation bills from collector's editions of the game began to draw high value on the market.After one collector was arrested for tax evasion after procuring employment in exchange for these collector's edition Monopoly notes, Parker Brothers feared their value would plummet, sinking sales.The Monopoly Act was passed and signed into law Aug. 5th of 1974, barely noticed during a time of political turmoil and a mere four days before Richard Nixon became the first American president to resign from office.The wording of the bill, however, provides an unintended loophole for cryptocurrency:""No token, bill, virtual currency, or counterfeit money, whose purpose it is to parody legal tender or otherwise serve as a novelty, and where such can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, shall be subject to taxation, regulation, or licensing by any branch of government, but shall instead enjoy free and unrestricted exchange. (emphasis added)” On Friday, a federal judge ruled that cryptocurrencies are, by virtue of lack of a physical form and issuing bank, by definition virtual currency and as such current financial regulations do not apply.While the cryptocurrency field enjoys a period of unregulated economic activity in the United States, for now, those in certain third-world countries have not experienced similar good fortune. Both Zimbabwe and Venezuela have enacted regulations that would treat any token traded as a store of value or used for compensation for goods and services as money, regardless of the object itself.These laws were put in place in both countries following times of drastic hyperinflation when citizens resorted to trading fake currency and game tokens because they held value better than government-issued money.UPDATE: In response to this article, US president Donald Trump has denied the legality of unregulated cryptocurrency activity, criticizing Cointelegraph via Twitter:",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #USA    #Donald Trump  
"Asia’s Fintech Race: Trends, Regulations, Lessons For The West",Alicia Naumoff,2/12/2017 15:57,1438,593,"Asian fintech companies continue their growth and overseas expansion. The Chinese fintech firm Ant Financials’ payment arm Alipay has recently started partnering with Finnish mobile payment provider ePassi to launch mobile payments for shopping and services on Finnair’s flights, therefore, marking a significant milestone in the development of mobile payment services in air.Alexander Yin, chief financial officer of TCG, the parent company of the Finnish mobile payment provider ePassi, said:""In the fintech and mobile Internet sectors, China is a global leader thanks to business, innovation, market size and population density.""Indeed, while on the global scale fintech is growing rather rapidly, the industry is absolutely booming in Asia and particularly in China. Last year was the year fintech became legit in the region, with everyone from banks to governments starting to pay more attention to the industry development.According to a report by KPMG and the Australian investment firm H2 Ventures, five of the world’s top 10 fintech firms are from China. Moreover, EY reports China being the homeland of fintech unicorns - eight of the world’s 27 fintech startups worth more than $1 bln are from China.Last year Asia surpassed the US and Europe on fintech investment, with investment volume by the end of the year reaching $1.2 bln versus $900 mln in the US and $200 mln in Europe.So what is it there in the region that made this happen? Strong startup culture, significant venture capital availability and the need for alternative finance instruments have definitely contributed to its fintech boom. But what are the other factors that drive fintech growth there?Regulations play a big part in encouraging the growth of fintech industry in the region. For example, the Singapore government is set on the path ensuring that regulations enable the sector’s continuous growth.The Monetary Authority of Singapore pledged to create a regulatory sandbox and an innovation lab for fintech startups to test their ideas without compromising their users’ security also ensuring their compliance with local laws.This example inspired other countries to follow. Malaysia and Indonesia have put forward a series of regulations to make sure that everyone is protected - from the market players to consumers. Thailand has been looking to create regulatory sandboxes of their own.Japan has advanced in regulating digital currency exchanges, while the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan have established working groups to unveil the country’sfintech potential.Positioning itself as the gate between the East and the West, Hong Kong started actively supporting startups from around the world helping them to come there and use it as a launchpad for the rest of the region. It is actually becoming a perfect meeting and partnership point for industry experts not only from Asia but from the rest of the world.Matthew Dooley, the founder of Connected Thinking, which provides consulting and training services for banks, insurers and large corporations helping them to become aware and take advantage of technology innovations, shared his view on the fintech revolution in Asia during the Next Money meetup in Hong Kong.“Asia is not like any other region, in the sense that there is a lot of different problems, different lifestyles and different cultures and fintech is actually solving those kinds of problems,” Dooley explains. “There’s a real diverse collection of startups.”Companies trying to digitize banking services and extend them for the unbanked continue blossoming in the region. Mobile payment services providers are expanding and regulators are being quite proactive in setting up fintech liaison offices. A lot of disruption is going on in terms of creating simple services for the customers.“Asian economies are mobile first economies,” notes Dooley. “In China, for instance, 72 percent of the population has smartphones, therefore it is obvious that the main intention here would be to address this kind of persuasive, viral behaviors that are sweeping traditional experiences in the whole areas and regions.”Tapping on the increasing adoption of smart devices in Asia, many companies are offering financial services through the Internet and mobile networks. This enables the unbanked to gain an access to banking services and mobile payments services. This push to access the unbanked through digital channels is believed to continue to rise in the region.“What Asian fintech companies really nailed here is the Online-to-Offline and Offline-to-Online services, creating this extraordinary wholly connected experience,” Dooley continues. “And this connected customer experience is something that everyone is striving to build at the moment, including traditional financial services providers because the competition from Internet companies is growing.”The rise of fintech is indeed forcing financial institutions to embrace technology innovation to gain a competitive advantage against startups. Traditional banks are challenged to find a way to remain relevant in this race.Many banks now focus on innovation anchored around digitization to further enhance processing efficiency, making the customer experience more interactive and intuitive and using structured and unstructured big data analytics to put their customers and the center of their business.Dooley says:“The thing that often holds them back is the skill set within the organization, the mindset of the individuals and the culture and structure within the organization.The key factor here is reinventing this structure and integrating the customer-centric approach, finding the connection with the customer, finding the passion for understanding their customer and solving their inconveniences in an innovative way. The design thinking is the key.”What gives a competitive advantage to fintech startup, for example, is that they do not have this conservative thinking, they are proposing innovative solutions based not on the legacy systems because they simply do not have those legacy systems.New technological advancements accelerated the emergence of a new generation of entrepreneurs looking to reform the existing ecosystems and offer a faster and more convenient customer experience.Asian fintech companies have big visions and these big visions are much more different from those in the West. What we are seeing in Asia is a strong collaborative approach that goes back to the communist fundamentals.“They are driven by socialism, they do know how to build communities,” Dooley explains. “And when you look at those communities, they actually do know how to ensure inclusiveness and connect that whole community.”Looking at the adoption rate of mobile payment services providers like AliPay, which is far beyond anything that has been done in the West, one cannot help but wonder why is it so that China has had such success with these technologies?What is it about the Asian region in general that makes it so different from others in terms of financial technologies adoption? “Like most of the economies it was a cash-based economy, with a whole bunch of problems that caused a lot of frustration,” Dooley shares his view. “What services like Alipay managed to bring to the table was the simplicity of the experience meaning that anyone could actually use these services.”“They took other technologies from other parts of Asia – for example, Korea and Japan, that came up with the QR code, a simple technology that was able to link the physical with the virtual,” Dooley concludes. “As a result, we have got this whole connected ecosystem that allows everyone to live their lifestyle without cash.”Demonetization policies that are being introduced in an attempt to get the cash out of society pursue rather simple intentions – to ensure higher transparency for the governments but also ensure simplicity of the lifestyle for citizens while cutting out the costs for maintaining of money systems.The path of the Asian fintech evolution is perhaps what Western fintech companies should be looking at. Ghela Boskovich, Director of Global Strategic Business Development and Marketing at Zafin says:“Asia has waited a little bit longer in terms of regulations in the industry. So they are learning lessons, they are taking a much more measured approach and it’s not ‘Let’s try this’, it is actually ‘Let’s sit and strategize and calculate this.”Perhaps the most interesting thing that differentiates the path of Asia in embracing the fintech revolution is that due to this diversity of cultures, the banks, regulators, emerging businesses and trade industry players are actually approaching this diversity as something really important and they are attempting to ensure inclusiveness in the industry driving it forward.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Asia    #Alipay    #FinTech    #Payments  
Poland Officially Recognizes Trading in Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,2/7/2017 16:49,5076,1364,"Poland has officially recognized the trading and mining of virtual currencies as an ‘official economic activity’ according to the Central Statistical Office of Poland, hereinafter GUS. GUS is Poland’s executive agency dealing with national statistics and reports directly to the Polish Prime Minister’s office.A statement posted in Polish on the GUS website and machine translated says that starting Dec. 1, 2016, the issuance of electronic currency and purchase and sale of electronic currency via the internet stand classified by official statistics services in Poland.Companies that are active in this area will be able to gain an official PKD 64.19.Z registration.The position of Bitcoin in Poland has been undergoing a sea change, while way back in 2013 there were reports of an official from Polish Ministry of Finance as saying, “What is not forbidden is permitted. However, we certainly cannot consider Bitcoin to be a legal currency.”Then in September 2015, the Polish Finance Ministry issued a statement to the effect, “Any regulatory action addressing the problems of trading virtual currencies. They should be taken either as a result of initiatives at the EU level with a view to the cross-border nature of the business or as a result of a threat market failure cryptocurrency.”Poland has been one of those countries that want to tax Bitcoin profits and the unclear status of Bitcoin in Poland has been a source of anxiety as banks in Poland have moved to close accounts of clients trading in Bitcoin.It would be interesting to see if Bitcoin can be accepted as a currency in Poland or throughout Europe as it has already been in Japan, for example.",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Poland    #Cryptocurrencies    #Tradings  
Why Bitcoin’s Survival May Not Depend On China,Olusegun Ogundeji,1/16/2017 14:30,532,424,"Recent Bitcoin price behavior, due to the happenings in China, has raised the question of whether the digital currency can survive without the support of the world’s largest country where a majority of its related activities are considered to be taking place.However, insiders’ views and a keen look at the turn of events show that China has presented the world with an exemplary opportunity to make the Bitcoin market less dependent on it.There have been talks about a regulatory framework in the making not just in China but other parts of the world. The debate has started on how far a government can go to ban Bitcoin use in its jurisdiction. The recent drop in Bitcoin price has also encouraged a somewhat form of redistribution of wealth as some reports say the low price of Bitcoin made it possible for some new users in countries in India, South America and parts of Africa to lay their hands on the coins.In short, it demonstrates that when governments can't make something illegal, they bring it into their fold. It has seemed friendlier to embrace Bitcoin in the United States, European Union, China, Russia and Japan.Countries now tend to see the opportunities Bitcoin presents to them to meet the needs of a growing middle class and those people moving from cash to cashless.Note it is not a single nation that has gotten involved. Though China still has the upper hand in terms of the early adoption, several countries are getting involved in Bitcoin related activities going be new information emerging with time.According to the COO of Remitsy and organizer of Beijing Bitcoin Meetup, Neil Woodfine, China’s huge trade volume has been misleading and the country’s dominance in Bitcoin mining does not translate to control. He also argued that thinking in terms of nation-states does not work when it comes to Bitcoin.Woodfine states that Bitcoin’s value proposition is too great to just disappear even in the worst-case scenario that Chinese exchanges were closed down, or Chinese traders got bored and moved onto another hyped asset.For the CEO of DECENT, Matej Michalko, told Cointelegraph on China’s perceived grip on the entire crypto-world:“We can only speculate. The truth is, China’s crypto-market seems rapidly developing, no one can deny that. However, Bitcoin is a global currency, not dependent on the single economy, no matter how powerful it is. China’s willingness to put effort on Bitcoin trading should encourage other countries to adapt their legislature in favor of a more flexible approach to cryptocurrencies. We have to evolve our business and move past the early 2000s decade. It doesn’t mean opening doors completely and not setting any meaningful rules. We have to acknowledge cryptocurrencies as an equal alternative to fiats.”",5,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Price  
"US Cannabis Group Denied Banking, Time For Bitcoin?",William Suberg,6/23/2017 11:30,22390,994,"Fiat-based legal cannabis entities in the US are under pressure as an advocacy group suddenly loses its bank account.As multiple resources report, The Marijuana Policy Project this week received notification from PNC Bank it could no longer use its services.MPP, which does not directly deal in cannabis, said PNC considered serving the group to be “risky” despite there being no legal issues.“They told me it is too risky. The bank can’t assume the risk,” MPP Chief Operating Officer Nick Field told the Washington Post.The move is curious in the current US climate, as medical cannabis businesses are flourishing within a newly-relaxed atmosphere in many states.PNC allegedly reacted to an intended plan by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse the slackening of regulations relating to cannabis.A spokesman had little to say on the matter, telling the Post that “as a federally regulated financial institution, PNC complies with all applicable federal laws and regulations.”In the meantime, however, the fledgling Bitcoin-based cannabis industry is flourishing in the US.

SEC is Still Eyeing to Regulate the ICO Market,Anthony Coggine,6/27/2017 22:36,18250,617,"US Securities and Exchange Commission is still eyeing to enforce regulations to Blockchain companies engaged in ICO.With the increase of Blockchain start-ups crowdfunding their projects through ICO, Blockchain experts are worried that the lack of transparency with regards to the issuance of such coins could pose dangers to investors and may be a cause of concern for government regulators as ICOs are ""high on radar"" of regulators.According Reuters, Securities and Exchange Commission “is said to be taking a hard look at the increased use of such offerings, with the growth of so-called ICOs surging in recent months.”With its virtual nature, ICO is likely and can possibly be used for money laundering activities , which makes regulating bodies such as SEC to look into it closely.The problem facing regulators is the kind of system in which these Blackchain companies are operating. With their decentralized nature meaning no single entity responsible for issuing the coins, while regulators can only go after its third-party service providers which include wallet providers and Bitcoin exchange platforms.In 2014, Janet Yellen, Chair, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System clarified that Fed has no jurisdiction for Bitcoins.""“[T]he Federal Reserve simply does not have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way. . . . [T]o the best of my knowledge, there is no intersection at all in any way between Bitcoin and banks that the Federal Reserve has the ability to supervise and regulate.”The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 broadly define the scope of “securities” to encompass any stock, bond, future, swap, investment contract, and more. Since there are no regulatory guidelines on how to treat Bitcoin or Blockchain, SEC has decided that companies using Blockchain technology for the purpose of trading securities would need to register as an exchange, Alternative Trading System (ATS), or broker/dealer.Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as:“any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) interprets the definition to mean any organization, association, or group of persons that: (1) brings together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, nondiscretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of a trade.Therefore, if a Blockchain technology platform brings together several buyers and sellers of digital assets that are deemed as securities, the platform could be required to register as a Securities exchange unless it falls within an exclusion from registration.To be classified as securities, the company owning cryptocurrencies would need to provide shares. For instance, SEC held in the matter of BTC Trading, Corp. and Ethan Burnside, specifically because when the company allowed users to purchase stock in virtual currency, they violated Sections 5 and 15(a) of the Exchange Act for not registering as a broker/dealer, or as a national securities exchange.Fortune staff writer Jeff John Roberts says:“Even the most legitimate and fiscally sound ICOs pose a potential threat for their issuers. “Coins” or tokens can look a lot like traditional securities, because they enable companies to take investors’ cash while holding out the potential for profit. And selling securities without SEC approval violates federal law”. While ICO tokens continue to be traded without government regulations, it’s only a matter of time until SEC would come up with some form of regulation that may ultimately cause a setback to many Blockchain companies and their ICOs.

Lack of Regulation Is Hurting Bitcoin in Many Regions: Study,Joseph Young,4/20/2017 18:05,8727,213,"Cathy Mulligan, co-director of Imperial College London’s Center for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering, stated that the lack of regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are holding back Bitcoin startups in many regions.India is a prime example of Mulligan’s concern with insufficient and impractical regulatory frameworks. Startups, exchanges and trading platforms in India are currently self-regulating themselves with strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies due to the lack of regulations and clarity in the country.Although Indian regulators confirmed with local publications that the legality of Bitcoin will be decided by May 20, 2017, for years, Indian Bitcoin exchanges and companies were not able to achieve their full potential. They target the country’s general consumer base due to the government’s unclear regulations toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Mulligan explained that startups in the UK are experiencing the same issues as companies in India. Startups are requesting clarity on regulations for Bitcoin and Blockchain development but the country’s regulators are yet to provide clear regulatory frameworks for the Bitcoin and Blockchain industries to grow.“We have the situation in the UK where many startups are chasing the regulator to say, ‘How are we going to be regulated?’ Bitcoin in the UK is really treated as private money. If you tried to exchange Bitcoin for sterling you don’t get charged VAT on the value of the Bitcoin but it is charged on, for example, the commission instead. From the UK perspective, we haven’t seen huge amounts of regulation,” said Mulligan.Unlike other regions such as the US and China, Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms are not required by the UK law to establish AML and KYC systems. However, the majority of exchanges do have strict AML and KYC systems in place to avoid similar issues OKCoin and Huobi suffered in China.When the Chinese government rolled out its AML and KYC regulations on Bitcoin exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin were required to halt their services until they comply to the newly drafted regulatory frameworks.“They aren’t being forced to have AML or ‘know your customer’ regulation just yet. I think what will happen in Japan is, there will be an influx in startups because the business environment is stable and you’ll know how you’re going to regulate it,” added Mulligan.In order for Bitcoin to achieve wide mainstream adoption as the digital currency, governments must approve it as legal tender and enforce practical regulations for the industry to develop.The Japanese and Philippine governments introduced official regulatory frameworks on Bitcoin after recognizing it as legal tender and payment method. Such clarity in the legality of Bitcoin allowed the Bitcoin industries in Japan and Philippines to experience a rapid rate of growth.Eitan Jankelewitz, an attorney at Blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused law firm Sheridans, explained that Bitcoin hasn’t demonstrated its full potential as a digital cash system and currency. For Bitcoin to achieve complete mainstream adoption, Jankelewitz reaffirmed that efficient regulatory frameworks must be introduced.Jankelewitz wrote:“The brutal truth is that as a currency in the UK, and perhaps globally, it hasn’t taken off. People generally buy it because they think it’s going to increase in value in the long term or they just like the volatility and they decide they are going to trade it the same way you trade gold. It’s another currency, but there’s no burning need for it.”",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #United Kingdom    #Bitcoin exchanges    #Tradings    #Mainstream  
Georgia Becomes First Country to Register Property on Blockchain,Frisco d'Anconia,2/8/2017 12:30,6607,2440,"On Tuesday, in Tbilisi, the government of Georgia signed an agreement to use the Bitcoin Blockchain to verify property transactions.Last April, the Georgian government and Bitcoin company BitFury initiated a project to record land titles on the Blockchain.This is the first time a national government is using the Blockchain to safeguard and authenticate state operations, therefore ushering in a belief in the technology that has wrongfully been painted black.As a matter of fact, the private Blockchain that will be an alter-proof ledger will also be provable using the Bitcoin Blockchain that is in the public domain.As of now, a software has been built and tested on some land title registrations. The Georgian National Agency of Public Registry and BitFury signed a memorandum of understanding paving the way to extend services to the registration of new land titles, demolition of property, mortgages, purchases and sales of land titles, rentals as well as notary services.There are many other projects focusing on Blockchain land title services apart from the BitFury and Republic of Georgia drive. This includes Sweden, Honduras and Cook County in Chicago which are being run by ChromaWay, Factcom and Velox respectively.Media reports hinted that Peruvian Economist Hernando de Soto is associated with the Georgian project. De Soto, in his book Mystery of Capital, estimates that there is ""dead capital"" of $20 trillion globally, consisting of buildings and lands without legal title.Georgia’s Minister of Justice, Tea Tsulukiani, says that she is optimistic her country will be able to work with Blockchain technology from this coming summer to have real estate quotations in a completely trustworthy and avant-garde.Papuna Ugrekhelidze, chairman of the Georgian National Agency of Public Registry, stated in an announcement that his outfit is “very pleased with the technical progress and looks forward to continuing [their] fruitful collaboration.”BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov also told the media that the Georgian government is excited about how the whole work was handled and executed with the current method. He explained that all the changes were made on the back end and the only dichotomy for the citizens of Georgia is that they can monitor if a title is legitimate when it is entered into the system.Vavilov revealed that the current platform is phase one and at a beta stage but the software will be fully operational this year:“The big goal is to move [the process] to smartphones, so people can use it 24/7 and all transactions are secured, transferrable and accountable.”So far, BitFury has been able to raise $90 mln funding including a $30 mln investment by Credit China FinTech Holdings in January.Implemented on a property, Blockchain technology maintains agreements in diverse fashions. In Blockchain-based entries, records are time-stamped, as well as consequent modifications to these records. The aforementioned would permit public members interested in a property to examine and establish the date of previous sales.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Republic of Georgia    #BitFury    #Valery Vavilov  
As People’s Bank of China Sends Bitcoin Spiralling Down the Centralization Era Comes for Bitcoin,Shivdeep Dhaliwal,1/16/2017 16:41,554,200,"China is at the center of Bitcoin as it should be. After all, most of the world’s Bitcoin is mined and traded there. However of late, the Chinese Bitcoin scene has a new persona on the stage and that is the country’s almighty central bank, the People’s Bank of China hereinafter PBOC.The PBOC has of late issued two statements, one on Jan. 11, 2017 and the other on Jan. 6, 2017 both of which have sent Bitcoin falling from the early January highs the currency had achieved above the $1,000 mark. So what is prompting the PBOC to take an interest in Bitcoin and what is the likely outcome of this interventionist approach?The last fall in Bitcoin did more than just terrify their investors, it actually hurt. In an article in the South China Morning Post, the author Xie Yu cites the case of Ding Wen, a 34-year old man who lost 40 percent of his investment in Bitcoin as he was unable to log into his Huobi account.Ding Wen was using leveraged betting to invest in Bitcoin. As Xie Yu writes:“Now speculation, derivative products, leveraged betting and program trading appear to be spreading in the largely unregulated Bitcoin market. Such practices are thought to be responsible for pushing up the price of Bitcoin by more than 260 percent since early 2016.”That is not all. China Daily also cited a Bitcoin trader Ma Yuanchuan who also lamented:“Sometimes platforms suspend trading when prices plunge. For investors, this could mean a significant loss if they cannot sell and withdraw immediately.”Let us be honest here: if the PBOC has found a reason to investigate these exchanges, it is because of the laxity on their part. People not being able to log into their accounts to execute trades is a serious lapse. However, now that they have the opportunity the PBOC can also serve their other purpose.SCMP quoted The China Securities Journal, which is sponsored by China’s official news agency Xinhua, “Regulators have noticed that some Bitcoin platforms crashed during the recent market volatilities, causing some investors, particularly those trading with leverage tools, to bear huge losses because they were unable to log on to the website during the sell off.”The newspaper further added that there is a discussion among Chinese regulators and industry insiders about improving trading security by setting up third-party custodian platforms on the Bitcoin market.Now you can argue all about the ridiculousness of a custodian service or the likely benefits or disadvantages of having one but the very idea that PBOC and Chinese regulators are mulling it over considers the level of control they can exercise over Bitcoin at least within their own borders.Given that most of the Bitcoin world is presently in China, the impact would be felt far beyond the Chinese frontiers if such action was to be taken by the authorities.Sun-Tzu said these famous words and they stand true to this day.It may not be the Chinese central bank’s intention to destroy Bitcoin or to control it. It may just be to give a gentle reminder to everyone that they can cause it go crashing down.No, it was not the media reports including any report from us that sent prices down, it was the PBOC. This is an undeniable fact.Was the famously opaque central bank issuing these press releases for routine inspections as a matter of course? Was there anything sinister intent behind their motivations to cause a decline in Bitcoin? Will this volatility induced by PBOC lead people to feel jittery over Bitcoin?Remember Bitcoin had been fairly stable for 2016 before these helpful and friendly statements of PBOC. If there is some explaining to do over this, it should not come from the targets of the ‘investigation’ but it should come from the central bank itself. If it was a routine on-site or off-site inspection, they could have gone around it without making any announcement but they chose to do so in this case and that is the question at the center of this all.For the foreseeable future, there is no escaping from China if you live in Bitcoin land. No India is not going to be an alternative.The ground situation in India is simply not conducive as of yet to become a Bitcoin alternative. China and India both have the same issue of capital controls. Indian capital controls are even more restrictive. Add to that the lack of infrastructure and the high temperatures that make mining difficult.As Kumar Gaurav, Founder & CEO at Cashaa, Auxesis Group says:“India is certainly not an ideal destination for the mining farms which produce enormous amounts of heat and lack of electricity, but necessity is the mother of invention. Also, Solar power in India is a fast-growing industry, and especially last year initiatives of PM Narendra Modi has fuelled the ambitious Solar projects. Undoubtedly, this will bring down the cost of electricity in India. But more than that current movement around Bitcoin and recently Blockchain are picking up and no surprise if we see some investment in the mining sector. Mining has become a need due to the Bitcoin market dynamic to meet the local Indian demands, no matter what premium it requires.”So that leaves us with China and if the Bitcoin culture in China has to survive, it is more than likely it will have to play by the rules laid out by PBOC. We are entering an era of centralisation of a decentralized currency. Brace yourselves.",11,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #Bitcoin Price    #Peopleâ€™s Bank Of China  
IMF Chief Christine Lagarde Says International Crypto Regulation Is ‘Inevitable’ And Necessary,Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/12/2018 14:54,25176,528,"International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde told CNNMoney yesterday, Feb.11, that regulation of cryptocurrencies is “inevitable” and necessary on an international level.When asked during an interview with CNNMoney emerging markets editor John Defterios, about the increasing popularity of crypto markets possibly being caused by a “starvation for high returns in the global markets,” Lagarde replied that the trend showed a “herd mentality” of those looking for high yield products as well as an element of speculation.Lagarde added that this trend was also fueled by “dark activity,” a reference to the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used for money laundering and other illegal online activities due to their anonymous nature.Lagarde herself was convicted of criminal charges in Dec. 2016 for facilitating an illicit transfer of $400 mln between Nicolas Sarkozy and Bernard Tapie, although she has denied any wrongdoing.As regards regulation of crypto, Lagarde spoke of its inevitability and the need to focus on regulating “activities” over “entities”:""It's clearly a domain where we need international regulation and proper supervision.”As early as October 2016, Lagard told the Wall Street Journal that she sees banks adopting digital currencies in the next five years, while adding that regulation will be needed to prevent money laundering and fraudulent activities.And in October of last year, Lagarde had expressed interest in the IMF possibly releasing its own cryptocurrency after her previous comments about the potential benefits for countries with weak national currencies to launch their own digital currency.As the crypto markets have seen a relatively volatile start to the new year, banks and financial institutions have become more serious about regulating cryptocurrencies.Several large banks worldwide banned credit card purchases of crypto. On the other hand, the joint Commodities and Future Trading Commission (CFTC) and the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) hearing on Feb. 6 gave off the impression that future regulation must nurture the crypto sector instead of smothering it.",11,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Christine Lagarde    #IMF    #CNN Money    #Government    #Markets  
From Gibraltar to Australia: How Countries Approach ICOs,Darryn Pollock,2/16/2018 11:58,25842,332,"With Blockchain came Bitcoin, which spawned Ethereum, this led to a few other major coins either forking off or being born a new in the crypto space. As this ecosystem has grown, however, there has been a boom in more cryptocurrencies being created; the ICO boom.As more and more companies participate in ICO’s as a fundraising tool and draw in even more interest from individuals and investors, governments and regulators have started taking notice. The issue is, these hitherto unregulated investment opportunities are basically created with no safeguards for investors. They are mostly set out as promises in a white paper to solve a particular issue with the power of Blockchain. However, holding them to those promises has not always worked.For regulators and governments, these investment opportunities often have the hallmarks of dangerous scams and are predominantly looked upon with suspicion. This has led to a need for regulation and safeguards for individuals investing in them. The regulation of these ICOs has come predominantly from governments across the globe, but they haven't followed anyone precedent, in fact, the divided opinion between nations on the entire cryptocurrency space has seen a divided approach being taken to regulate them.Because ICOs are still a new phenomenon for many regulators, the laws and rules about how to govern and regulate them are still being formulated and rolled out. In fact, some governments have only just recently made any public statement or warning on them. Some countries have been proactive and set out their decision on ICOs - either in a positive light or in a negative one. While there are also those that are still building their regulations as they continue to learn more about the technology behind it, and what ICOs actually mean for their citizens.Some countries have quickly caught up with ICOs and made their decisions on how they will operate in state border. There are those who have either flat-out banned them, and there are those who have set out specific rules and laws for them to comply with.One of the most high profile regulations, and this time in a negative manner, of ICOs was the way in which China dealt with these fundraising methods. The Chinese government proclaimed a blanket ban on ICOs last year, which played its part in dipping the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The ban was implemented by the People’s Bank of China and was aimed at all businesses and individuals. It was as extreme as all those who had finished their funding cycles were ordered to repay the funds.While there were rumors about a cryptocurrency ban in another major Asian hub of cryptocurrency, the South Koreans have officially banned ICOs. The South Korean Financial Services Commission explained their decision by saying they were aiming to protect investors from the growing risk of scams and ICO frauds.Russia is another country that has taken a hard-line approach to both cryptocurrencies and ICOs. In regards to their regulation of the latter, it is still not finalized and complete, but there has been a number of orders set out by the Kremlin. These orders affect things like altcoins registration, taxation, as well as the application of securities laws. But the true regulatory laws are set for March this year.As one of the first nations to institute true ICO regulations, Australia made sure they were covered in keeping ICOs inline and protecting their citizens. The Australian regulators reacted at the end of September as their Australian Securities and Investment Commission laid out the rules.The approach of the Australians is to set out clear guidelines for how to operate within Australia’s regulatory framework while encouraging innovation and the development of new financial business models. Ultimately, it is a positive framework for ICOs, but holds them inline with the existing legislative framework in order to protect citizens against and scams or fraudulent ICOs.The small UK territory off the coast of Spain has become one of the latest countries to draw up its own ICO regulation. Gibraltar government, and its Financial Services Commission (GFSC), are developing their draft law aiming to regulate the promotion, sale and distribution of digital tokens. One of the key concepts of this draft regulation will be a new idea that will see the introduction of the concept of “authorized sponsors,” who are supposed to be “responsible for ensuring compliance with disclosure and financial crime rules.”  The Abu Dhabi emirate of UAE also announced its plans for regulations of ICOs recently with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) willing to cooperate with relevant qualified institutions and individuals involved in the cryptocurrency industry, according to an announcement. The Abu Dhabi Global Market acknowledges the global demand for digital currencies, stating that: “virtual currencies, although not legal tender, are gaining interests globally as a medium of exchange for goods and services.”Because of the size of the US cryptocurrency market, and the growth of ICOs in the country there has been a need for rather swift and stern regulation from the government, and especially the SEC. However, just like there are differing approaches in different countries, each state also has different ways in which to handle ICOs. The SEC, as a federal agency, does however mostly hold the view that ICOs are to be considered securities.To this end, there is no ban or blanket block out, but ICOs are expected to be registered and licensed with the SEC if they are to sell these assumed securities. Recently, in a discussion at the Senate, the SEC hinted at even further, and tougher, regulations for ICOS. The Chairman of the SEC, Jay Clayton, noted that every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is considered a security.Many nations have come forward and at least acknowledged that ICOs are something that needs to be looked at by their regulatory bodies. Moreover, some of them have moved to keep their policies in line while figuring out their approach. Because ICOs are pretty unprecedented in terms of being a fundraiser, a security, a way to gain capital, governments have looked to rather shoe-horn them into existing regulations and legislation.Last year, in August, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) issued a statement that ICOs would be falling into the legislation that governs securities, but it also called for a categorization of such a token as a security first. Essentially, it was a call for those looking to launch an ICO to run it past the CSA before advancing, letting them take it on a case by case basis.“Any business that is planning to raise capital through an ICO should consider whether it involves a security. Businesses should also contact their local securities regulatory authority”, it read.Germany is another country that has not yet set out direct regulation of ICOs, but they expect any new Coin Offering to adhere to the existing legislation, including the Banking Act, Investment Act, Securities Trading Act, Payment Services Supervision Act, and Prospectus Acts. They have also gone as far as to issue a warning however that there are risks in ICOs.“Due to the lack of legal requirements and transparency rules, consumers are left on their own when it comes to verifying the identity, reputability, and credit standing of the token provider and understanding and assessing the investment on offer. It can also not be guaranteed that personal data will be protected in accordance with German standards,” a statement read.Seen as quite a bastion of potential for ICOs and the cryptocurrency space in general, there have been a number of ICOs that have headed to its sure, especially considering the stance of China and others in the Far East. Their approach has been giving guidance at the moment, as they also develop their own stance. In November last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore offered a guide on ICOs, which indicates how these coins should be treated under current securities laws.The most recent word on ICOs in the country is that they will not be banned and that they do not feel there is any risk concerns. The MAS has been closely studying these developments and the potential risks they pose. “As of now, there is no strong case to ban cryptocurrency trading here,” the deputy Prime Minister said.Within the European Union, overall, there has been a focus bringing ICOs in line with current legislation. The main process in contending with them is to allow ICOs to operate within the union, as long as they adhere to Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer (AML/KYC) policies. However, like many of the nations in this category, The European Securities and Market Authority declared that they represent a high risk for investors.There are not many countries that have not redicated an ‘approach with caution’ response when quizzed about ICOs. It is usually the first port of calls for regulators who admit that they need to learn more about how ICOs function in their countries.It is understandable that they expect ICOs to operate within the bounds of their current legislation, and if they do decide to categorize them as securities, say, that they follow those regulations. There are a few countries that have been predominantly hands-off, really only offering a warning or advice as to how to handle ICOS. This libertarian approach does mostly seem to be a starting point before regulation comes in, in most instances.Japan took one of the biggest steps in legitimizing Bitcoin when it declared it a legal currency back in 2016. However, in regards to ICOs Japan has not taken many major steps towards controlling or regulating it. Japan has taken a wait-and-see approach to the ICO market with their statement an investor warning. The Financial Services Agency has also admitted that they are looking to international trends on this regulation front to follow.In September last year, the Malaysian Securities Commission sent out their own press release asking investors to take head of their warning when looking into ICOs. The Malaysian regulator also warned the investors “to be mindful of the potential risks involved in ICO schemes.”In Taiwan, Financial Supervisory Commission chairman Wellington Koo in October issued a statement on ICOs, Blockchain and Fintech, but instead of it being a warning, it was a positive stance. Koo said that the Taiwan government intended to support the development and adoption of ICOs, Blockchain technology and Cryptocurrencies, and address them as lawful.The UK allows for the operation of ICOs, but expects them to regulate themselves to the existing financial laws and regulations. On top of that, there have also been some stern warning.The Financial Conduct Authority warned that ICOs are unregulated and potentially fraudulent, while investors may be provided with “unbalanced, incomplete or misleading” documents by the ICO issuer, the Financial Times reported.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Russia    #China    #UK    #USA  
"Swiss Bank Extends Bitcoin Investment Opportunity to Germany, Austria",Olusegun Ogundeji,11/23/2016 17:00,606,540,"After the launch of its product for Swiss investors, who expect a positive development in the price of Bitcoin to trade transparently on the SIX Swiss Exchange for the first time, Swiss bank Vontobel has extended its certificate on Bitcoin to Germany and Austria. According to Heiko Geiger, its head of public distribution Europe, the tracker certificate offers investors a simple means of investing in the digital currency and the possibility to participate in the development of its price in USD, without having to own Bitcoins themselves.  He says to Cointelegraph:“We see a huge interest in Bitcoin as an asset class. So, we have launched the product for the German/Austrian market, too. Germany is one of the biggest and most sophisticated structured products markets and it is one of Vontobel’s focus markets.”The certificate is a simple bankable asset that is particularly suitable for investors who anticipate a rise in the acceptance and significance of Bitcoin as a way of payment and as an alternative currency.Vontobel, which manages and monitors a client’s assets entrusted to it and also observes the financial markets and interprets global macroeconomic developments, is the first Swiss issuer of a tracker certificate on Bitcoins for subscription.Switzerland has been dubbed a conducive environment for Bitcoin to thrive, due to its regulatory friendly measures for the digital currency.With the launch of this tracker certificate in Germany, Geiger says the environment could also be considered encouraging for similar investments.“The fact that we have launched the product and are able to do a public offer shows that the regulatory environment in Germany also suits these kind of investments.”Before the launch in Switzerland, the bank maintained that the impact of the product on the price of Bitcoin “will most likely be very low.” Trading commenced earlier this year on July 15, with Bitcoins purchased according to the subscriptions received from clients on that day, and with the products to be redeemed on July 23, 2018.Depending on the market environment and the client interest, they will possibly issue a new product afterwards.Vontobel’s reputation spreads across 22 international locations where they identify and analyze trends, and subsequently create innovative investment strategies and products for investors.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Investments    #Germany    #Austria    #Switzerland  
Cash Wars: Paper in Focus as Governments Seek More Control,William Suberg,11/21/2016 16:17,305,162,"Amid India’s sudden currency reforms, cash is facing a global crackdown as governments move to take control over transactions and the paper in the pockets of citizens.While turmoil continues on the Indian subcontinent after Prime Minister Modi withdrew the two largest rupee notes on Nov. 8, elsewhere other countries are following suit - for very different reasons.Across the Indian ocean, Australian banks are calling for the scrapping of the dollar’s (AUD) highest-denominated cash notes, and even the removal of cash altogether.In a report issued last week, investment bank UBS made the case for scrapping AU$100 and AU$50 bills, which account for 92 percent of circulating AUD by value. It presented data showing year-on-year drops in ATM usage compared with mounting credit card transaction numbers.The report states:“We believe removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks.”  Meanwhile, Citibank’s operations in Australia are set to lead the cashless trend with the bank announcing that some of its branches will no longer handle cash at all.Janine Copelin, Citi’s head of retail banking, says:“This move to cashless branches reflects Citi's commitment to digital banking and we are investing in the channels our customers prefer to use.""A survey by local bank Westpac in September further highlighted what is apparently a public inclination to eradicate cash transactions. It found that: “79 percent of Australians agree that a cashless society makes total sense.”Criticism of cash retirement is often heard within disruptive technology circles; banks reeling in paper means more control over costs and money supply, as well as greater surveillance of citizens’ transactions.At the same time, reducing cash is considered an almost impossible task in economies such as India, where the vast majority of the population is unbanked and relies on cash or perhaps, in the future, mobile-based Bitcoin microtransactions.As another case in point, Venezuela’s decision this week to limit ATM withdrawals to the equivalent of just $5, highlights the desperate attempts of government to control the uncontrollable.Like India, the country’s economic woes have caused a spike in Bitcoin interest, with exchange rates showing consumers ready to purchase at a premium. Local news resource Diario Bitcoin notes that the rate on Venezuelan exchange, SurBitcoin, is hovering around $875 - over 15 percent higher than average market rates.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Cash    #Government    #UBS    #Citi    #Westpac    #Australia    #Venezuela  
How The Korean Government’s New Bitcoin Regulations Will Affect Startups,Joseph Young,11/21/2016 12:48,730,354,"The South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) has established a task force to design regulatory framework for Bitcoin companies and users. The government states that regulations will be introduced by the first quarter of 2017.Several meetings have taken place since the FSC’s initial announcement of a potential introduction of Bitcoin regulation. South Korean media reported that the task force agreed to design its regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin companies based on the regulations in Japan and the U.S.While regulations greatly vary between states in the U.S., Japan has a unified regulatory framework in which Bitcoin startups are required to obtain licenses to operate. That means, by early 2017, South Korean Bitcoin startups and exchanges, including Tim Draper-backed Coinplug and Softbank-invested Korbit, will have to deal with a BitLicense-like regulatory environment.Based on the FSC’s stance on Bitcoin and its concerns for illicit purchases and use cases surrounding digital currencies, it is highly likely that KYC/AML policies will be strengthened for Bitcoin companies.Bitcoin exchanges will be subjected to particularly strict KYC/AML policies, as the task force, FSC and law enforcement will require exchanges to submit an extensive overview of users and their trading histories.It is also likely that South Korea may see a Coinbase-IRS conflict with its existing Bitcoin exchanges, as the commission believes Bitcoin and other digital currencies are used for tax-related crimes. In this case, exchanges will be required to hand over personal data and financial information of their users to law enforcement, which will then be shared with the National Tax Service.The commission stated:“Digital currency is often used for money laundering, drug trafficking and tax-related crimes since it is free from regulation.”Although South Korean Bitcoin exchanges currently have extensive KYC/AML verification phases, with the new regulatory frameworks and licensing system in place, it could become increasing difficult in 2017 for Korean traders to purchase and sell Bitcoin without providing personal and financial information.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea    #Government  
Canadian Government Moving Faster Towards Mainstream Bitcoin Adoption,Iyke Aru,11/19/2016 15:20,962,1722,"Recent events in Canada suggest its government could be well positioned to become an early mainstream adopter of Bitcoin.Thursday, Nov. 17 recorded the biggest attendance ever at the Toronto Bitcoin meet-up. Earlier on the same day was a meeting between Jason Cassidy, president at Crypto Consultant, who is quickly becoming a Bitcoin ambassador in Canada and the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). The meeting was a move to work with the commission towards cryptocurrency legislation in Canada.He says:“Bitcoin and Blockchain awareness appears to be reaching a tipping point in Canada.”Cassidy explains that the increased interest in the world's first truly decentralized digital currency seems not to be limited to enthusiasts and tech pioneers. The Government of Ontario is now taking an active role in helping to shape future legislation for Bitcoin and digital currencies, a trend that he says will become commonplace over the next few years as mainstream acceptance becomes a reality.Cassidy describes this development as groundbreaking steps in the right direction, as it opens the door for collaboration with various levels of government. “We are now at a point where, to grow the ecosystem further, we must work diligently with these groups to form a legal framework that makes sense for all Canadians,” he says.Cassidy did not hide his excitement towards Bitcoin’s progress in Canada. He notes that having been in the cryptocurrency space since 2012, it is very uplifting to see this type of progress.He concludes by saying to Cointelegraph: “I look forward to working hand-in-hand with the various levels of legislators across this great country to ensure a sensible framework is established for digital currency. You can expect to see a lot more of Jason Cassidy in the future as I advocate for Canada on a local and international stage.""",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Canada    #Government  
Theo Chino: NY Authorities Are Using Bitcoiners in New York as Guinea Pigs,Frisco d'Anconia,11/11/2016 16:08,811,173,"Bitcoin entrepreneur and software developer Theo Chino, has accused the New York Department of Financial Services of using Bitcoiners in New York as guinea pigs.The New York businessman has filed a petition at the Supreme Court of New York, challenging the mandate of the New York Department of Financial Services.In his claim, filed by the Ciric Law Firm PLLC, Theo alleged that the New York Department of Financial Services acted illegally and arbitrarily, and exceeded its regulatory power when it promulgated its controversial “Virtual Currency” regulation in 2015 - Part 200 of Chapter 1 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations.When Cointelegraph spoke to Theo, he accused the Department of acting against the spirit of the legal system. He explained how the Department’s regulation is legally unwarranted:“It is appalling that the former head of the Department admitted that his ultimate goal was to use the Bitcoin community as “guinea pigs” to test new rules for the banks, which the legislature never authorized. Article 78 of the State of New York clearly stipulates that any regulation in New York must precede by a law enacted by the Legislature.”The regulation, popularly known as Bitlicense, has put many small businesses into financial ruin. Reuters in October, quoted GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard as saying that securing a New York license was not worth the effort: ""It's too overreaching and burdensome, especially for the smaller companies.""“Because of this regulation, I am no longer able to pursue the expansion of my business, which I have to close as a consequence. This is why I am seeking the help of the judiciary branch, to tell these regulators they cannot play around with people’s lives and investments, and to stop them from using us as their toys,” explained Chino.Apparently, the Department’s regulatory burden is what we call, in economic freedom activism, as “making livelihoods illegal” by bureaucrats in their so-called bid to protect the consumer. The unintended consequence is the destruction of small businesses involved in Bitcoin.Theo further elaborated on how the regulation has forced small businesses out of New York. He alleged that many businesses of that kind have left for states like California where the ground rules are favorable. “The regulation stifles innovation and startups leading to many small businesses leaving the area, but it’s hard to know the exact number,”  Theo related forlornly.It costs a whopping $5,000 to file an application for a Bitlicense, running up to 500 pages of laid down procedures. Then there is scrutiny of business owner’s personal information as well as business plans and strategies. Some business owners are convinced that such a process exposes them to hackers.“It is a very expensive process, and there is nothing fair in the regulation imposed by the NYFSD,” Theo, whom from all indications is a brave man, echoed.Oddly the Bitcoin entrepreneur’s petition at the Supreme Court has not received the support and endorsement of the Bitcoin Foundation. In his judgement, Theo thinks the foundation has a different agenda:“I believe it’s a political issue. The Bitcoin Foundation and other associations are young in the political process, and they believe that they should not upset the regulator to accomplish their purpose. Having gravitated in the New York political landscape for more than 10 years, I think they are mistaken.”However, he is uncertain as to the consequences awaiting Bitcoin in New York, should the petition be thrown out. “It is hard to say. I do believe that it will be difficult for regular folks to get a chance to understand it,” he concluded.",1,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitlicense    #NYFSD    #New York    #USA  
Nine Blockchain Firms Get Free Ride by Regulators to Test Their Ideas in the UK,Olusegun Ogundeji,11/11/2016 11:32,390,506,"Nine Blockchain technology-related firms have been accepted into the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) regulatory sandbox, which enables them to test out their innovative ideas without immediately incurring all the normal regulatory consequences.24 applications were deemed fit to meet the sandbox eligibility criteria and were accepted out of 69 to develop towards testing, including early stage start-ups, challengers and incumbent firms.Earlier this year, the FCA signed a cooperation agreement with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to be the first time anywhere in the world that two financial regulators have agreed to make it potentially easier for innovative firms to access new markets by providing information to one another.Before the program was launched in May, FCA Executive Director of Strategy and Competition Christopher Woolard, gave the rationale behind it:“We are setting up a tailored authorisation process, which means that sandbox firms will first be authorised with restrictions, allowing them to test their ideas but no more. They still need to apply for authorisation and meet threshold conditions, but critically only for the limited purposes of the sandbox test.So the authorisation tests should be easier to meet and the costs and time to get the test up-and-running reduced.”He added: “If, after sandbox testing, the firm wants to launch itself into full activity on the wider market, it can do so if it satisfies the threshold conditions for that wider activity. We think this strikes the right balance – regulation that starts in proportion to the scale of the concept being tested and can grow with the ambition of the full business model.”Some of the Blockchain-related firms among the selected 24 include Billon, an e-money platform that facilitates the secure transfer and holding of funds using a phone based app; BitX, a cross-border money transfer service; Epiphyte, a payments service provider; SETL, a smart-card enabled retail payment system based on their OpenCSD distributed ledger; and Govcoin Limited, a technology provider that has partnered with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to determine the feasibility of making emergency payments using means other than cash or the Faster Payments Scheme.Others include Nivaura, which issues lifecycle management of private placement securities; Otonomos, a platform that represents private companies’ shares electronically on the Blockchain, enabling them to manage shareholdings, conduct bookbuilding online and facilitate transfers; Tradle, an app and Web-based service that creates personal or commercial identity and verifiable documents; and Tramonex, an e-money platform that facilitates the use of “smart contracts” to transfer donations to a charity.Other firms will be able to apply for the second cohort of the regulatory sandbox from Nov. 21.",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #United Kingdom  
"Hewlett Packard Emphasizes Importance, Potential of Blockchain, Decentralization",Joseph Young,11/6/2016 14:40,378,221,"HPE also known as Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a $52 bln parent corporation of technology company HP, recently emphasized the importance of irrefutability and decentralization for Blockchain networks.Andrew Dare, architect of financial services innovation at HPE in U.K, stated:“Blockchain presents an opportunity to bring disparate things together and allow secure and non refutable records of transactions to be done anywhere you need them to be done quickly, securely and with little chance of fraud. Therein lies the true value of the technology.”Dare and HPE believe that the Blockchain technology is still at its infancy. Its potential goes far beyond its applications for the financial industry because the Blockchain technology’s ability to store information on an irrefutable ledger can be efficiently utilized for various industries.However, Dare notes that irrefutability and decentralization are two of the most important features of the Blockchain network as they enable participants in the network to send payments to each other without mediators. They could also allow banks and major financial institutions to conduct labor-saving operations.Currently, a massive number of banks and financial establishments are gearing towards the development and implementation of the Blockchain technology. But, even multi-billion dollar institutions like Accenture have proposed the concept of editable Blockchain.In essence, a centralized or an editable Blockchain refers to a network that can be controlled and manipulated by network administrators. In a more technical sense, an editable Blockchain poses absolutely no difference than traditional SQL databases.HP understands that for Blockchain networks to function properly without major issues revolving around security and external attacks, decentralization and non-refutability are crucial.As the Blockchain market increases in size and value, more companies like HPE are beginning to understand and appreciate the core concepts and principles of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain networks.The real barrier between Blockchain implementation and development forms when banks and financial institutions come to a realization that with the current financial regulatory frameworks in place, it is virtually impossible to integrate a decentralized network.This barrier is what essentially led Accenture to pursue the concept of an editable Blockchain. If banks fail to demonstrate the ability to control and manipulate transactions, central authorities and established regulators will refuse the implementation of the Blockchain technology.For the $1.5 bln Blockchain market to work, banks must begin to address the issue of implementing the Blockchain technology and decentralized networks without colliding with strict financial regulations.As HPE states, the Blockchain technology and Blockchain-based platforms will fail to operate unless proper security measures are set in place. Thus, for the benefit of banks and their consumers, a more intelligent allocation of their capital and talents will be figuring out a way to embed decentralized infrastructures onto existing systems rather than attempting to alter the core principles of the Blockchain technology.",1,  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Hewlett Packard    #Decentralization  
South Korea’s Appetite for Bitcoin About to Get Much Bigger,Olusegun Ogundeji,10/26/2016 14:52,580,723,"South Korea has announced that it is now putting measures in place for the spread of top digital currency, Bitcoin.The Asian country is home to a few Bitcoin exchanges including Korbit and CoinOne which are currently placed in the 22nd and 29th positions in the list of top exchanges according to a 24-hour volume rankings on CoinMarketCap. It is also home to CoinPlug which has been around since 2013 and introduced the two-way Bitcoin ATM in the country.As suggested by the Chairman of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), Yim Jong-yong,  the government now plans to create a new consortium to develop and implement Blockchain technology in the financial sector within the next year and institutionalize Bitcoin to operate better in the future financial ecosystem. As a result, there are likely to be more activities in the fintech sector and its impact is likely to resonate across other sectors.Yim Jong-yong, at the 12th Fintech Center Demo Day event on Monday Oct. 24 said:""The government will push for the systematization of digital currency on a full scale in tandem with a global trend in the U.S., Japan and other countries. We have built the foundation for fintech industry over the past two years. Now, we are ready to take the next step, reforming financial regulations and system.”According to the Library of Congress, there are at present no laws in South Korea regulating the use of the Bitcoin system.  However, the president of the Bank of Korea recommended at a press conference in December 2013 that the top digital currency be regulated in the future. That time seems to be now.Yim said, “Blockchain technology is emerging as the core infrastructure of future finance. We will go ahead with joint research and pilot projects ahead of international trends by launching a joint Blockchain consortium of the financial industry within this year. We will also reinforce the functions of the Fintech Support Center to practically back the fintech industry and expand the size of support for policy finance to three trillion won for the next three years and use the funds as priming water for fintech ecosystems.”The FSC is the body responsible for financial policy and financial supervision in the country. It has mandates to draft and amend financial laws and regulations; monitor financial institutions; oversee capital markets; and supervise foreign exchange transactions.Yim said the government will also offer 3 trillion won ($ 2.65 bln) in financial support  for the development of the fintech sector over the next three years.During the event, the Korean FSC signed an MOU on cooperation in the fintech sector with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). They will exchange information about fintech-related regulations and policies, market trends and on joint projects on core technologies such as digital and mobile payment, Blockchains and big data.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #South Korea  
"Digital Currencies, ICO-Based Tokens Are Securities, Says Kiwi Finance Regulator",Lisa Froelings,11/7/2017 11:50,6866,305,"The New Zealand Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has claimed that the cryptocurrencies or any initial coin offering (ICO)-derived token will be considered as a security in the country. The decision was detailed in the new guidance on ICOs and virtual currencies, that was released by the agency.In its statement circulated in late October 2017, the FMA claimed that any digital currency or ICO-obtained token would be considered as a security. The finance regulator also explained the various means in which token sales will be covered under the country’s national law.""All tokens or cryptocurrencies are securities under the [Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013] – even those that are not financial products. A security is any arrangement or facility that has, or is intended to have, the effect of a person making an investment or managing a financial risk.""Under its issued guidance, the FMA stated that the ICO tokens could be considered as one of the four financial product categories, namely, debt securities, managed investment products, equity securities and derivatives. The agency further explained that the tokens will be classified based on their characteristics.""If appropriate, we can designate any security to be a particular financial product based on its economic substance. For example, a project token giving investors voting rights and a share in the company and its profits could be designated an equity security.”The FMA guidance included guidelines on how to treat businesses involved with the new technology.The agency claimed that all major companies offering key virtual currency services like wallets, brokers and exchanges should be properly registered with the appropriate government agencies. The regulator also stated that it could exempt companies from existing laws in its bid to “promote innovation and flexibility.”""We can grant exemptions to promote the FMC Act’s objectives. One objective is to promote innovation and flexibility in our financial markets. We can also, if appropriate, grant exemptions to ensure FMC Act requirements are fit for purpose for ICOs.""",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Digital Currency    #ICO    #Tokens    #Security    #New Zealand  
Russian Duma Orders Blockchain Research As Bitcoin Linked to Income Laundering,William Suberg,11/1/2017 16:27,23371,0,"Russia’s increasingly formal approach to Blockchain and cryptocurrency continues as the country activates its anti-VPN law Tuesday.Local news outlet RBK reported this week that the state Duma had opted to order “expert analytical research and opinion polls” relating to Blockchain for 2018.The tools will form part of a government desire to research “standard legal regulation of Blockchain technology uptake on Russian financial markets based on global experience,” the Duma’s financial markets committee and first vice-speaker Aleksandr Zhukov confirmed.Russian president Vladimir Putin appeared to seek an end to the contradictory government position on cryptocurrency regulation last month, calling for tightened, formalized controls on markets.The battle to influence consumers meanwhile continues in more informal circles, with central bank figures warning against the purchase of Bitcoin and ex-finance minister Alexey Kudrin disagreeing with current deputy Alexey Moiseev over whether it is a “pyramid scheme.”The country’s General Prosecutor this week also linked increased interest in cryptocurrency to “laundering” of income “gained via illegal channels.”Nov. 1 meanwhile sees the introduction of a controversial new anti-privacy law aimed at stopping VPN providers allowing Russians to access sites blocked by the government.Failure to comply will result in the VPN provider itself being blocked by state regulator Roskomnadzor, but the law only applies to the private use of those networks.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Cryptocurrencies    #Government    #Putin  
Government's warnings won't stop Vietnam from embracing Bitcoin,Diana Ngo,8/6/2014 16:52,284,0,"Asian countries have had disparate approaches on crypto-currencies and regulation. While Thailand’s foreign-exchange rules bar its conversion into other currencies, China and Vietnam have chosen a much more defensive approach towards Bitcoin.In April, China’s central bank barred financial institutions from handling transactions in Bitcoin to curb risk, and forced several Chinese Bitcoin exchange platforms to close their bank accounts by April 15th. Chinese yuan deposits were suspended for couple days, but activities returned to normal couple weeks later, and BTC China, the major Chinese exchange platform in volume with more than 3000 BTC traded everyday, recently enabled American and Hong Kong dollar deposits.“As a company, we’re growing; we’re going to continue to offer more services to allow people to buy and sell — transact Bitcoins — regardless of how the regulation plays out in the next few months and years,” stated Bobby Lee, BTC China CEO in April.Down south, in its neighbor country Vietnam, Bitcoin businesses have chosen a similar strategy. Regardless of the Government’s threats and warnings, VBTC, the result of a partnership between Vietnamese Bitcoin startup Bitcoin Vietnam Co. Ltd. and Israeli trading platform Bit2C, launched the first live Bitcoin trading platform in early July.- VBTC's HomepageThe announcement was made in March, only a month after the State Bank of Vietnam delivered to the Government its report on digital currencies, stating that the Vietnamese dong was the only legal tender in Vietnam, according to the Constitution. In fact, both the Government and the State Bank of Vietnam stated that Bitcoin is not recognized as a mean of payment in the territory, mentioning Bitcoin’s threat to the State control and the local economy. Officially launched to the public on July 9, VBTC only operated for 3 days before the police and the State Bank announced a partnership to crack down on the Bitcoin exchange and its administrators. This announcement was the second warning made by the authorities to the Vietnamese exchange. In April, they warned both Bitcoin Vietnam Co. Ltd. and Bit2C about the irregularity of their live trading Bitcoin platform project. VBTC CEO, Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong, said that her company was currently in discussion with the Vietnamese authorities and that VBTC was in favor of a collaboration with the Government to prevent Bitcoin related crimes. According to Dominik Weil, a Bitcoin freelance consultant based in Ho Chi Minh City working for VBTC, “Bitcoin is like digital gold.” In fact, the depreciation of the Vietnamese dong has made people reluctant in holding to their local currency and most of them would rather have large transactions payments such as house purchases made in US dollars.Along with the dollarization of Vietnam’s economy, gold is commonly used as a store of value and wedding gifts often consist in jewelry. These economical habits added to the poor and volatile valuation of the dong, gives Bitcoin a large panel of opportunities and development perspectives in the local economy. - Panorama of Hanoi, the Capital City of VietnamBui Huy Kien, the founder of lamchame.com, a portal for parents which recently started accepting Bitcoin payments in its website for advertisements, said in a phone interview on July 23 with the Vietnamese press Thanh Nien:“I don’t really trust the dong because of the way the Vietnamese currency is managed. It’s not transparent. Gradual distrust in the dong motivates people to use Bitcoin.""VBTC's parent company Bitcoin Vietnam Co. Ltd has seen its users database consistently grow to 1,800 users since it’s launch in March. Bitcoin is gaining a lot of attention from the locals and although the community doesn't seem so active, there is a large network of miners and Bitcoin enthusiasts operating underground, according to Weil.Despite the State Bank of Vietnam's warnings to “organizations and individuals to not hold, invest or execute any transactions involving bitcoin or any other similar virtual currencies because possession, trading and utilization of Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies as assets pose risks and are not lawfully recognized nor protected,” as noted in an emailed statement in respond to Bloomberg on July 30, Bitcoin startups and businesses are determined to boost the technology in Vietnam and provide what is judged to be a reliable and trustworthy store of value that fits to local habits. The State Bank of Vietnam devalued the dong on June 19, weakening the reference rate by 1 %. Since 2004, the currency has lost about 24 % of its value. A number that pushes Le Thao, the founder of a startup in Hanoi that develops softwares for digital currency touchscreen kiosks, to state in a July 21 interview that “Bitcoin could play a big role in Vietnam,” adding that the technology was here to stay, “so Vietnam has no choice but to accept it.”Did you enjoy this article?

Pittsburgh Govt. Mulls Integrating Digital Currencies,William Suberg,7/14/2014 11:49,151,0,"While California moves forward with a case for Bitcoin integration, across the country Pittsburgh is mulling a plan which could see it become the first US municipality to accept digital currency.Let’s Talk Bitcoin reports that a local government subcommittee document which appeared online recently sets out steps for “Improvement of digital government,” which among other things explicitly states the possibility of “perhaps becoming the first municipal government to accept digital currency.”And while the report does not mention Bitcoin specifically, the local government’s stance can only come as a boost to an area which is only just starting to improve economically after many years of capital flight.Should the decision be made final, the infrastructure needed to make digital currency a reality for government fees, parking taxes, etc. is already available. As LTB notes, the E-Gov Link scheme (organized by parent company Electronic Commerce Link) “would be able to facilitate Bitcoin payments on behalf of local governments.”The tools on offer extend even to integration with BitPay or Coinbase on municipal authorities’ behalf, but E-Gov Link’s CEO told LTB at the same time that there has as yet been little firm interest in the scheme.“For some, it’s considered politically or financially risky. For others, it just doesn’t seem to be something they want to be first with.”Yet as is becoming increasingly common in pockets of the US, the Pittsburgh Bitcoin scene has been slowly attracting media attention over the past 12 months. And despite LTB noting the local Bitcoin meet-up group sports a modest 164 members, it is these pockets of progression which enabled California to make digital currency a matter of state significance, recognized by lawmakers as necessary “to address Californians' payment habits in the mobile and digital fields.” For now, it would seem that any formal inclusion of Bitcoin for Pittsburgh is uncertain, but given its southern counterpart’s success, any pondering on the part of government would provide a much-needed positive PR injection.Looking for the best applicant for your vacancy?

US Auction of Silk Road Bitcoins a Sign that Regulation Settling – Circle CEO,Vaultoro,7/1/2014 16:13,160,0,"The dust around regulation of Bitcoin is starting to settle, the founder of Bitcoin finance company Circle said, with the US government’s relatively friendly stance toward the cryptocurrency apparent in last week’s auction of bitcoins seized from online marketplace Silk Road. Bidding opened (and closed) on Friday in the US Marshals Service’s 12-hour auction of nearly 30,000 bitcoins that were confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation when it shut down Silk Road, a marketplace notorious for facilitating criminal transactions such as drug trafficking, last October.The way the American government structured the sale of the bitcoins shows that it, alongside investors, is settling into a reasonable understanding and treatment of cryptocurrency, said Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Monday.“[They are] doing it in a very controlled manner; they’re not flooding the market. They’re creating an opportunity for institutional investors, which is a big deal,” Allaire said, according to the newspaper. The results of the auction, which a spokesman for the US Marshals Service (USMS) said drew 45 registered bidders and received 63 bids, was due to be finalized Monday. However, the USMS will not declare any of the bidding prices or announce the winner of the auction, leaving it up to the winner to advertise their victory. As of Tuesday, no winner has publicly announced their bid.Several big-name financial players bid on the bitcoins, worth nearly $US 19 million, including SecondMarket and US investment firm Pantera Capital, but the companies said Monday that their bids were unsuccessful.  Bitcoin prices, meanwhile, were up 6.8% on Monday at about $US 639, according to transaction database blockchain.info, rising in anticipation of the auction results.The varied market interest in the auction (from private investors to large corporations), Allaire said, illustrated the serious notice the financial community is starting to take of the cryptocurrency sector.“What we’re hearing is that some of the big broker dealers on Wall Street are setting up small trading desks just to get exposure to the asset and understand it,” he said in the interview. “That’s the approach now as opposed to a year ago when people thought governments would never allow it, and banks just wanted it to go away. All of the major banks now have teams trying to make sense of bitcoin.”The auction is also a sign of how regulation is becoming increasingly clearer, Allaire said.“All of the major banks now have teams trying to make sense of Bitcoin.”“A year ago, most governments and big banks frankly just wanted bitcoin to go away,” he told the Wall Street Journal. “So now people are saying: ‘it’s not going to go away and there’s big money coming into this, this is a real innovation, we need to get our heads wrapped around it, and we need to figure out whatever rules we’re going to wrap around it,’” he said.According to blockchain.info, the market value of the 29,656.51306529 bitcoins up for sale in the auction is around $18.8 million. ",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Silk Road    #coins  
California Governor Approves Bitcoin Use in State,Carlo C,6/29/2014 20:15,139,0,"Governor Jerry Brown, once known, affectionately on the Left and sarcastically on the Right as “ Governor Moonbeam” demonstrated that while he seems to have moved toward a conservative bent in his later years he still  has a Progressive heart. Along with a slew of other Bills, including one to repeal the requirement that food handlers wear gloves, the Governor signed into affect Assembly Bill 129, which in effect repealed the law that made it illegal to recognize any but official currency.The Bill first made clear that under Title 18, Section 474 of the U.S.C., and current California law that it was illegal  for any individual or business to create a currency. But the new law goes further and says:“...ensure that various forms of alternative currency such as  digital currency, points, coupons, or other objects of monetary value do not violate the law when those methods are used for the  purchase of goods and services or the transmission of payments.” Instead of ignoring state and federal law, AB 129 simply creates an exception to the law. The Bill's affect is to repeal the part of state law that says: anything ""but the lawful money of the United States."" is illegal and federal law is quite specific on counterfeiting being applied to physical currencies and does not mention digital. The issue has not been raised either in the US Courts or Congress to date.The sponsor of the Bill, Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento) said essentially that the future was here and ignoring it was folly.“In an era of evolving payment methods, from Amazon Coins to Starbucks Stars, it is impractical to ignore the growing use of cash alternatives.”This move should not be surprising to anyone familiar with California. The state is the nation's technology capital and home to many Bitcoin start-ups. But California has always been on the cutting edge of both technological and social change. The new law will probably have little or no immediate effect on the state's struggling economy but the potential for long term benefit as the leader in the acceptance movement is enormous. There are strong rumors of the NASDAQ will be introducing a new Bitcoin platform on the exchange, which will give Bitcoin is first opening on a regulated exchange and Bitcoin ATM;s and new merchants are popping up every day.

Western Union waits for “Bitcoin Currency Regulation”,Cyril Gilson,6/26/2014 11:06,112,0,"While Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek suggested on Bloomberg TV that the company ‘would consider using Bitcoin’ in future, how likely would that in fact be?“Not until it is regulated like a currency,” Ersek told Trish Reagan, underlining a continued fundamental misinterpretation of what virtual currency is. And while he noted that Bitcoin is an asset rather than a currency, the reaction to his statements was one of waiting too long for status quo which could never arrive.“Even the CEO of Western Union wants to get rid of Western Union,” a popular comment by u/spottedmarley posted on Reddit in response to the interview reads.One perspective to have surfaced following the interview is that Western Union could potentially offer Bitcoin transfers while keeping its fees, which even Reagan noted “have been accused of [being] very high”, comparable to today.As members of the Reddit community also point out, this would need to be achieved by relying on the willingness of current customers to trust in the service over performing Bitcoin transactions themselves for reasons of security or convenience.On paper, these two factors manifest in the following ways. Security would come in the form of Western Union’s ability to pay out in 191 currencies with a reduced risk of loss or theft compared to private transactions. The convenience factor, as Ersek mentioned, would stem from the company’s notorious ubiquity.But while Ersek was all too keen to recite ‘key credentials,’ among them “We go to places other companies don’t go,” he does not account for the evolution of the Bitcoin infrastructure in the meantime.Should a scenario develop which sees Western Union offering Bitcoin transfers in the next few years, by that point, Bitcoin would more than likely have evolved to include the apparatus necessary for remote buyers and sellers to use a cheaper alternative (more convertor parties in remote locations would be a good example of this).With a more developed infrastructure comes better security, allowing customers to set value for money as an increasingly high priority. Meanwhile, Ersek played down Reagan’s probes into the perennial issue of Western Union’s vetting practices when accepting payments to certain “contested” locations, cited by Reagan as Iraq, Afghanistan and Ukraine.Regardless of technicalities, it remains that Bitcoin and Western Union will not cross paths in the near future, as the former develops and the latter considers strictly fiat-based alternatives. ",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Western Union  
Legal Basics: Owning and Using Bitcoin in Europe,Armand Tanzarian,6/9/2014 11:00,835,0,"As with the United States, Bitcoin regulations in Europe — particularly in the European Union and EFTA — are murky because they can exist at the union level and at the level of the member state. “Furthermore, the Central Bank considers exports of goods and services in exchange for Bitcoin in breach of these capital controls. Icelandic merchants and service providers are thus not able to legally accept Bitcoin as payment. The Central Bank has yet to take a position on whether Bitcoin is considered a currency according Icelandic law. It does not consider Bitcoin to be e-money. It is unclear if domestic parties are allowed to transact in bitcoin among themselves. Bitcoin mining appears to be tolerated.” Rome has made no explicit regulations regarding Bitcoin other than issuing a decree in April 2014 that defines electronic currencies and allows for their use within the framework of the 2012 EU directive.""However, the use of electronic currency is restricted to banks and electronic money institutions — that is, private legal entities duly authorized and registered by the Central Bank of Italy,"" BitLegal.io writes: ""Aside from these developments, Italy does not regulate bitcoin use by private individuals, and currently the implementation of initiatives concerning the use of electronic currencies lies with the EU.""",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Europe    #Belgium    #Bulgaria    #Cyprus    #Denmark    #Finland    #France    #Germany    #Iceland    #Italy    #Netherlands    #Norway    #Poland    #Slovenia    #Sweden    #Switzerland    #United Kingdom  
"“Tight Regulation within Bitcoin Will Stifle Innovation” - Hugh Halford-Thompson, QuickBitcoin",Chris Anderson,6/4/2014 8:29,146,0,"On an unusually warm London evening I attended my first Bitcoin meeting at the Vape Lab, site of Cointrader.net’s London Bitcoin ATM. There I met Hugh Halford-Thompson, who hosts the weekly Bitcoin meet up. Hugh is the Co-Founder of QuickBitcoin, which allows people in the UK to trade Bitcoin quickly and easily as well as head of UK Operations at the cointrader.net exchange. Cointelegraph: What were your first impressions of Bitcoin and what drew you to it? Hugh Halford-Thompson: When I first saw Bitcoin I completely missed the point and wrote it off as something that would never take off. Two years later (march 2013) I was introduced to it properly by my brother Guy and as I read about the technology and read Satoshi’s white paper I realized how big a breakthrough the blockchain technology is. Most people don’t realize that Bitcoin the currency is only the first application of Bitcoin the technology. CT: What inspired you to host the London Bitcoin Meet up at the Vape Lab on Tuesdays from 4pm-8pm? HH-T: I want to help people new to Bitcoin understand how great Bitcoin is and how easy it is to trade as well as discuss and debate more in depth issues surrounding the world’s first decentralized blockchain. For the more experienced we discuss uses of Bitcoin beyond just currency. It was clear from talking with Hugh that the large London Borough of Hackney is becoming a Bitcoin utopia.Here at the Vape Lab, where QuickBitcoin is based, one can buy a smooth caffè latte and tasty pastry and pay in Bitcoin plus top up Bitcoin wallets with the Cointrader ATM. Also in the local area you can grab a beer and a bite to eat at the Pembury Tavern in Bitcoin as well as ‘The Old Shoreditch Station’ Cafè/Bar and Exhibition Venue which also accepts Bitcoin. Changing the topic slightly we talked about the dark side of the entrenched fiat British banks.CT: How have you been treated by the old fashioned fiat banks where you have your company bank accounts and what does this mean for cryptocurrency businesses in general? HH-T: Even if one sets up a company that only organizes talks about Bitcoin that company bank account stands a high risk of being shut down. Banks are very prejudice against all of this. CT: Do you think there is a place for any of the other altcoins apart from Bitcoin? HH-T: I think they are good as testing grounds for new Bitcoin features but I do not think any of them offer serious alternatives to Bitcoin. The exception here is Bitcoin 2.0 projects such as Ethereum, Next, Mastercoin… each of which offer something different from or on top of Bitcoin. CT: What do you think about regulation of Bitcoin and organizations such as the Bitcoin Foundation? Do you feel there is a place for them or do you think, because of the way Bitcoin is designed as a decentralized cryptocurrency, regulation is irrelevant? HH-T: There is a place for regulation around the entry and exit points to Bitcoin. Within the crypto ecosystem the protocol replaces most of the regulation. Traditional laws still apply to stop fraud but tight regulation within Bitcoin will stifle innovation. Bitcoin is a platform like the internet that needs to be open so that people can build upon it. CT: Looking to the future what do you see as major developments in the Bitcoin space as well the future for QuickBitcoin / Cointrader UK? HH-T: We recently launched a brokerage where we match buyers and sellers OTC. This is to cater for the growing number of 6-7 figure requests from bankers and finance companies. I see more traditional financial firms looking at Bitcoin every week - when they get more involved it should push up the price to a more stable level. The other area which I can see really taking off is the remittance business. We are currently in talks with BitPesa and aim to undercut banks and Western Union for sending money from the UK to Kenya.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Hugh Halford-Thompson    #Meetup    #London  
Texas green-lights Booze for Bitcoin,Allen Scott,6/3/2014 10:38,117,0,"While other states like Ohio have shown bizarre resistance to payments in Bitcoin for alcoholic beverages despite its residents hosting a Bitcoin boulevard last month, Texas has demonstrated once again that it is ahead of the pack by a wide margin as far as Bitcoin adoption and regulation is concerned.The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) has recently received an inquiry from CoinVault ATM CEO and founding member of the Texas Coininitiative Sheldon Weisfeld. The Texas Coininitiative is a non-profit organization that seeks to promote the acceptance of Bitcoin in the lone star state.The aim of Mr. Sheldon’s question was to bring the issue of paying for alcohol using cryptocurrencies in the state of Texas to light. Yesterday, Carolyn Beck of the TABC responded:“Unlike Ohio state law, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code does not require the customer to pay in money when purchasing an alcoholic beverage from a TABC-licensed establishment. Specifically, I am talking about a retailer, winery, brewery or distillery selling to the ultimate consumer. The acceptance of digital currency such as Bitcoin from a consumer in this situation is the establishment’s choice.”The TABC is the state agency responsible for regulating all phases of the alcoholic beverage industry in Texas, which includes regulating sales, taxation, importation, manufacturing, transporting, and advertising of alcoholic beverages.TABC’s statement essentially gives the go-ahead for alcohol to be sold for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, for example, depending on the preference of the TABC-licensed seller. More importantly, the decision brings much needed clarity for both alcohol vendors and consumers regarding the regulatory framework and eliminating the risk and confusion of a grey-market type scenario for both parties.In response the Texas Coin initiative stated on its website:“The Texas Coinitiative applauds the TABC and their move to reassure merchants that accepting Bitcoin will not jeopardize their alcohol license. In the next few months, in light of the cleared regulatory haze, several alcohol-serving businesses around the state will likely announce their acceptance of Bitcoin.”Now that Texas has given the green light, it joins the ranks of other states such as California, which also permitted the sale of alcohol (for anyone over 21) using cryptocurrencies as payment at the beginning of last month.The additional form of payment using cryptocurrencies could potentially boost revenue for the TABC, which collects over $US 200 million annually in taxes and fees that are funneled towards the state’s public schools, local governments, research, and other state services. Meanwhile, the Texas Coinitiative is planning a Bitcoin Embassy in Houston, Texas in the near future.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Texas  
Bitcoin in Canada: On Regulation and Prospects,Sabina Laska,6/1/2014 6:33,676,0,"Canadian regulation of Bitcoin is favorable so far, but several more conditions have to be met for the cryptocurrency to meet its potential, a new report by a Canadian research institute found. The report, entitled “How Should Bitcoin Be Regulated?” and published by the Montreal Economic Institute last week, analyzed how cryptocurrency is treated in Canada compared to several other countries and offered insight on what needs to happen for Bitcoin to reach normalized, widespread use. Overall, pretty positive. Canada treats bitcoins like simple goods that can be exchanged in a barter system. The Canada Revenue Agency, the country’s tax regulation body, has declared that businesses have to declare sales in Bitcoin, and the currency falls under capital gains taxes if they are bought or sold for investment or speculation. Bitcoin is not considered money, so the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada (FINTRAC) says it is exempt from money laundering laws. The Bitcoin environment in Canada is better than in the United States, the report said, but still not as good as Germany. Unlike in the US, Bitcoin users in Canada aren’t obligated to report transactions in the currency for capital gains tax, bypassing the bookkeeping nightmare that’s worrying tax law-abiding Bitcoiners across the border. Bitcoin is considered property by the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS), meaning users technically have to keep extensive records on all their transactions. New York’s Department of Financial Services is also working on creating BitLicenses to issue to Bitcoin exchanges, though the terms are still being hammered out. Heavier regulation in the States, “by undermining a fundamental use of Bitcoin, namely that of a currency facilitating all sorts of transactions, could discourage the use and adoption of this digital currency,” the report said. However, the report said, at least the US government has a clear stance on Bitcoin so users know how they’re legally supposed to treat it. In Germany, government attitudes to Bitcoin have reached a happy medium between control and acceptance. Bitcoin there is considered an international currency. Germany was one of the first nations in the world to regulate it (they’re go-getters) and the country also saw the first partnership between a bank and a Bitcoin exchange last July. The government’s rules are clear and not overly complicated, the report said, making it clear why Germany is a popular hub for Bitcoin. What’s in the cards for Bitcoin’s future in Canada – and the rest of the world? For Bitcoin to reach its potential, the report concluded, three conditions must be met. First, users must get a concrete benefit from using Bitcoin over other currencies. Second, governments must have clear rules for taxing and regulating it, which will boost consumer confidence in the currency and encourage investment. Third, the rules can’t be so complicated or antagonistic that they hamper Bitcoin’s use as a medium of exchange. Canada does plan to step up its regulation in the near future. The government said in February that it plans to introduce legislation to bolster its anti-money laundering measures to better address emerging risks, including the rise of virtual currencies. However, the report said, that change could be positive – it might boost interaction between Bitcoin companies and banks, which would up the currency’s credibility. Overall, the report concluded, governments need to remain open-minded. “Bitcoin is a technology that is constantly evolving, and that has multiple uses,” the report said. “The rules that regulate Bitcoin should ideally remain flexible and be adapted to this fluid character so as to give free reign to innovation,” it said. The Bitcoin Foundation Canada issued a comment on the report on Thursday, acknowledging that the Canadian government was justifiably concerned about money-laundering, but that cumbersome regulation to solve the problem was not welcome. “It is perfectly normal for governments to ask Bitcoin exchange platforms…to identify their customers,” the statement said. “We believe this would suffice in clarifying the legal framework surrounding Bitcoin and that no other regulation is needed in the near future.” Message received: Bitcoin users in Canada enjoy government’s relatively hands-off stance and want to keep it that way. Bitcoin use is growing there: Canada’s now the second most popular destination for venture capital investment into Bitcoin companies, behind the US and China. Still, it remains to be seen how friendly Canada will remain towards Bitcoin going forward.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Canada    #USA    #Germany

Argentinean Central Bank Warns Against Using Bitcoin,William Chen,5/29/2014 14:30,137,0,"The Argentinean Central Bank has joined the ranks of other central banks across the globe to issue a warning on cryptocurrencies. The official statement reads:While this may seem like an echo of warnings released by other central banks, this particular statement can be interpreted from various angles.First, the mention of cryptocurrencies not having “legal tender” status may be a caveat for not only citizens but financial institutions in the country to refrain from using these currencies. On the other side, the Central Bank is promising to study these “virtual coins” and potentially creating a legal framework for regulating cryptocurrencies in Argentina.In a country with strict capital controls, which do not allow currency exchange for above 20% of an individual’s income, impose high credit card fees for overseas transactions, and where it is also illegal for citizens to buy gold, Argentina’s warming towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrenices is certainly not surprising.Wences Casares, CEO of Xapo said:It is true that Bitcoin is gaining a lot of traction in Argentina, where many citizens are increasingly losing faith in fiat and beginning to adopt the digital currency as a hedge against the freefalling Argentinean Peso. Thus, the current economic climate in the country could be a blessing in disguise as it may drive Argentina to become the hotbed for Bitcoin innovation in Latin America.Alan Safahi, CEO of a cash-to-bitcoin service ZipZap, which operates in Latina America, recently supported these sentiments in an interview with Coindesk:Indeed, a taxi cab service recently started accepting Bitcoin as payment. What’s more is that the demand for an alternative currency to the Argentinean peso is so high that Bitcoins have even entered mainstream commerce. Enbitcoins.com is a service that allows citizens to pay for utilities such as electricity, water, gas, cable TV and telephone. Last year, a documentary film on Bitcoin in Argentina was released describing the deteriorating economic situation in the country. A year later and still no end in sight to the liquidity crisis as the country devalued the peso by another 20% at the beginning of the year. If this trend continues, it will certainly force people to overlook any government warnings and shun the peso in favor of cryptocurrencies as a means of staying afloat.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Central Bank    #Argentina    #Wences Casares    #Alan Safahi  
Regulating Down Under: Australian Taxation Office Preparing Bitcoin Guidelines,Malleya Stripe,4/30/2014 5:24,116,0,"In early April the National Australia Bank (NAB) decided to cut ties with the bitcoin community and close any accounts that primarily dealt with the digital currency on May 2. The NAB believes dealing with digital currencies is too risky. Less than one week later, Australia’s first bitcoin ATM went live in Sydney, the first of several proposed ATMs in the land down under. To round off the month, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is preparing to meet with head figures of the Bitcoin industry along with accounting and tax experts to prepare guidelines on taxing and regulating all virtual currencies. The taxation guidelines are expected to be made public on June 30.This is not the first time Australia has brought up taxing Bitcoin. Last June the ATO advised Australians selling goods via bitcoin to include the income on their tax return. The upcoming consultation is stepping it up a notch and will try to figure out how to deal with bitcoin as income, investments, transactions, and how to treat mining and Bitcoin exchanges.PhotoBitcoin advocates hope to work with the ATO to further legitimize bitcoin as a legitimate currency in the eyes of the state and remove irregular laws, like the fact that goods and services are taxed twice in every bitcoin transaction.The proponents for the digital currency are hopeful they will get a fair shake. Asher Tan, founder of Australian-based Coin Jar commented on the proceedings and noted that “how they approach this new vehicle, which hasn’t been seen before, it takes a bit of ­consideration as to whether any existing legislation outright applies to it. Regulation is important but it has to be considered; it shouldn’t be too hasty but all regulators should try Bitcoin before they regulate it.”Overall Bitcoin in Australia has been well received. Companies are allowed to trade in the currency and the purchase and mining bitcoins is not illegal.Earlier this month, Professor David Glance, director of software practice at the University of Western Australia, said that NAB’s severance with Bitcoin was an “odd reaction” given the fact that the Australian exchanges were far smaller and provided less of a risk than colossal ones like Mt Gox and evidence from companies showing something illegal was absent. Hopefully, he and the rest of the Australian Bitcoin community won’t see any more odd reactions in legislation come June 30.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Australia    #Taxes

Ukraine Government Imposes Regulation on Bitcoin,Neil Bergen,2/21/2014 9:35,113,0,"Finally, some clarity from the Eastern Europe side, as businesses in Ukraine that have something to do with Bitcoin would have to be registered and follow the general law.The initiative to make the statement took the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) that proclaimed the necessary registration for payment systems and operators of infrastructure for payment systems. In case the named group is not registered with the NBU, its activities are utterly illegal.NBU, which is the central bank of Ukraine, also points out that no other bank or financial institution can provide legal registration for any Bitcoin enterprise. Together with the announcement the standard warning about the possible risks involved with the Bitcoin trade were made and I am not going to repeat them.An interesting fact – even though NBU called itself an  official regulator and took control of the situation, there is no intention to provide any guarantees and is not responsible for any loss associated with cryptocurrency.Seems familiar, isn’t it? So, the Ukraine looked around for guidelines what make of digital coins and how to manage them and the decision came from the good old Washington DC.

"EU to Tighten Cash & Gold Controls, Surge in Bitcoin Demand Will Follow",Joseph Young,12/23/2016 12:00,549,430,"On Dec. 21, the European Commission tightened controls on the inflow of cash and precious metals from outside of the EU. Describing its decision as a move to crackdown on terrorist financing, the Commission granted permission to border patrols to seize cash or gold brought in by suspects.Customs officials in EU states, as well as border controls, can seize and restrict the inflow of cash and precious metals without particular guidelines as to whom is suspected of terrorist financing or funding of militant attacks. Such ambiguity in the new proposals could potentially lead to the false confiscation of funds carried in by civilians coming into the EU.Individuals holding over $10,400 in cash must declare at EU state customs before entering a member state. If they fail to do so, individuals could be scrutinized by the newly proposed regulations. The EU executive Commission also stated in a note obtained by Reuters that authorities will be able to seize money below $10,400 upon their independent investigations and considerations.To date, cash and precious metals are the only two stores of value that the European Commission plans on regulating. The inflow of cash and gold will be closely investigated, which could cause great discomfort for people moving into EU for casual purposes such as leisure or business.However, the Commission hinted that other forms of money transmission are under consideration and more forms of assets or money could be regulated and restricted by customs officials.Julian King, the security commissioner of the EU, stated:""There are a lot of new ways of transferring money and not all of those are covered in the EU-US scheme.”In the past, the EU suggested tighter Bitcoin controls and regulations on exchanges with the implementation of more thorough KYC / AML policies. If this is the case, exchanges could be pressured by local authorities to present user data and financial information to the EU member states and government agencies for further verification.On July 5, the European Commission released a document entitled “Commission strengthens transparency rules to tackle terrorism financing, tax avoidance and money laundering,” which read:“To prevent misuse of virtual currencies for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, the Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.”To avoid such regulations and restriction on the inflow of cash, the general population will most likely search for alternative assets like Bitcoin to send money into the EU. Thus, in the short term, if the Commission goes ahead with the proposal, the demand for Bitcoin could rise in Europe.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Cash    #Gold    #Terrorism    #Money Laundering  
Approved: UK Securities Exchange Says ‘Yes’ To First Bitcoin Investment Fund,William Suberg,12/19/2016 16:35,645,1068,"The UK’s Channel Islands have given the green light to Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), marking the launch of the world’s first listed and regulated Bitcoin fund.GABI, which has existed since 2014, is Global Advisors’ first product, the group later launching COINXBT and COINXBE, which both made pioneering debuts on the Swedish Nasdaq.It will trade on the Channel Islands Securities Exchange (CISE).“The time is right,” Global Advisor Principal Daniel Masters commented in a press release issued today:“Bitcoin now has a market capitalization of over $12.4 bln, an all-time high, with approximately 16 mln coins in issue. Bitcoin is the leading digital currency, ranking 73rd in the total amount in circulation on the global list of M1 forms of money.”He added that recent analysis showing an eight-fold increase in implied value by 2026 also helped spur the listing.GABI is being sponsored by local firm Verras Professional Services, whose Director Jonathan Bale is also the specialist at the alternative asset law firm which helped the fund list successfully.The pay-off from the exchange listing is not least a boost to the funds’ reputation, Bale says, with GABI now “able to demonstrate the oversight, due diligence and monitoring that comes with regulation and an exchange listing.”“This is testament to the hard work that Global Advisors’ principals… have put into evolving an institutionally robust offering,” he added.The fund was already the first regulated Bitcoin fund at its launch two years ago, with Masters adding that the new first was nonetheless a result of how far the product had come. He commented:“Today's listing of GABI on the CISE acknowledges how far we have come over the last two years since GABI was launched as the world's first regulated Bitcoin fund, as well as the transformational role Bitcoin is starting to play as a global currency and its emergence as an important, uncorrelated asset class for investors.”However, the race for the prowess of Bitcoin instruments is meanwhile far from over.Earlier this year, fellow British territory Gibraltar launched the first Bitcoin exchange-traded instrument.

Anhui Family Bitcoin Mining Farm Seized By Chinese Police For Stealing Electricity,Joseph Young,12/16/2016 9:30,653,319,"The Chinese law enforcement cracked down on a Bitcoin mining farm in Bengbu, Anhui province, for illegally allocating a local electric power company's energy source for Bitcoin mining operations. The local police of Bengbu seized ASIC miners and other equipment used to mine the digital currency.Xin’an Evening, a local news publication in China, revealed earlier this month that a family in the Anhui province used home energy sources provided by a local electricity service provider to mine Bitcoin.The digital currency which the family obtained was used to finance the family’s expenditures. The news publication further noted that the family made enough money through its mining farm to finance up to 8 years of their future expenditure.Bengbu Tianhu Power Company received various reports of surging line loss rate at a local community of residents. Usually, the power company experiences a loss rate of around 5% but since May it surged to 97%.After the company discovered an unusual increase in their loss rate, the firm conducted a formal investigation to look into the local community’s increased spending on electricity. The investigation led by inspectors and the Bengbu police revealed that an unknown white cable was connected to a starter box located in the main building of the village.The inspectors and police followed the cable down to the basement and eventually discovered a room full of Bitcoin mining equipment such as ASIC miners and cooling technologies.As soon as the inspectors revealed that a local family was stealing electricity from the village and from the Bengbu Tianhu Power Company, the police arrested the family and seized all the mining equipment located within the facility.8BTC, a Chinese Bitcoin publication, also noted that in 2016, three Bitcoin mining sites were cracked down on and 74 miners remain detained. The recent arrest of a local family in the Anhui province brings the total to four illegal mining sites and 77 miners detained in the year to date.Although it is still unclear whether the family will be ordered to compensate for the losses of the power company, it is said that the firm lost around $26,000 as a result of the Bitcoin mining site’s illicit usage of electricity.Each ASIC miner in the illegal Bitcoin mining site consumed 51 KW an hour and the entire operation consumed 1224 KW total. After various expenses including the cost of mining equipment, the family secured a profit of over $27,000 in the past six months. ",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Mining    #China    #Police    #Electricity  
Russia Calls for Celebration as Bitcoin Becomes Legal,Frisco d'Anconia,12/13/2016 16:25,4272,1660,"A couple of weeks ago, Russian authorities announced that Bitcoin use was legitimate in the eyes of the law. With a population of 146 mln people, Russia is an important market for Bitcoin and other digital currencies.Cointelegraph spoke to Jake Smith of Bitcoin.com to find out if the new development calls for a celebration.Cointelegraph: Russian authorities just endorsed the use of Bitcoin as legal. What is your reaction?Jake Smith: Over the years we've heard countless rumors about some country or another first banning Bitcoin, then clarifying that they are only regulating it, then reverting to say that they are legalizing it, ad infinitum. Because of this, I find it hard to get too excited or too worried whenever I hear of any country taking a policy stance on Bitcoin. However, if Russia has truly decided to give Bitcoin the official green light, then I think this is fantastic news.CT: When the authorities say Bitcoin use and transactions could be considered as money laundering and terrorism financing, what does it imply?JS: I think it implies that the authorities do not understand Bitcoin or they have an underlying agenda they are pushing. They do not understand Bitcoin because calling it a money laundering or terrorist financing tool ignores that fiat currency (probably the very currency the particular authorities are responsible for!) is still the number one tool for both money laundering and for financing terrorism and black markets.Bitcoin can only be used for those things because it meets all the conditions of being a good form of money. What the regulators really mean when they bring up these concerns is that Bitcoin is not a form of money they can control and manipulate. They may have an agenda because they do not want the citizens of their country using a currency that they do not have control over.CT: Is this in anyway an indication of global government acceptance of ?ryptocurrency?JS: Yes, every time a country (especially a big country like Russia) clarifies their legal stance on Bitcoin and gives it the green light, I think this is a vote of confidence for Bitcoin's global acceptance and adoption.CT: Does the statement legalizing Bitcoin and other cryptos not confusing for you?JS: I suppose it is somewhat confusing. Mostly I find it ironic because Bitcoin and other cryptos will continue to function regardless of what regulators have to say about it. I think it provides a valuable insight into the minds of regulators, that they believe they can control things that they really have no influence over.CT: Is Russia that important of a market for this to call for a celebration?JS: Every country that gives Bitcoin the green light is a cause for celebration, but Russia's population is 143 mln, nearly half the size of the United States. As a country with stricter capital controls, Bitcoin will prove especially useful to Russian residents. So yes, I think it is worthy of celebration.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Russia  
Ireland to Address Bitcoin Blockchain-Related Regulatory Conflicts,Joseph Young,12/11/2016 14:19,646,448,"To facilitate the development and implementation of the Blockchain technology in Ireland, a non-profit advocacy group called the Blockchain Association of Ireland (BAI) will launch on Dec. 14. Reuben Godfrey, the co-director of the BAI, stated that the organization will bridge the gap between startups and large-scale institutions to establish Ireland as a global FinTech hub.One of the major aspects of Blockchain implementation which most startups and corporations struggle to deal with is regulatory conflicts. Because the Blockchain technology is a decentralized protocol in nature, existing financial frameworks and money transmission regulations come in conflict with the implementation stage of the technology.Godfrey stated in an interview with local publication The Irish Times that the association will first focus on helping startups and institutions to become fully compliant with various regulations by cooperating with local lawmakers, regulators and educators.It also aims to educate the government, central bank and the authorities about the benefits and advantages of utilizing the Blockchain in a wide range of industries including healthcare, FinTech, finance and real estate.While doing so, Godfrey announced that the association will be hosting Blockchain conferences and discussions, with a vision of bringing the Irish Blockchain community together. The association hopes to see startups, large institutions, innovators and developers come together and discuss the potential applications of the technology.Godfrey told The Irish Times:“The association primarily bridges the gap between informal and formal networks to open the public dialogue and advance Ireland as an innovative hub for technology and the multiple societal and commercial applications of Blockchain. We are non-profit and member-led and will facilitate workgroups, seminars, and trainings with the aim of producing practicable white papers in all the key verticals [specific markets]. We aim to bring the Irish Blockchain community together at our annual summit, Deepgreen 2017, in April of next year.”To date, Bitcoin is seen as the only successful Blockchain project worldwide as it has proved its unprecedented security measures and developed resilience to external attacks and bugs. It also has a market cap larger than most reserve currencies, as covered by Cointelegraph this week.Thus, Godfrey noted that Bitcoin will always remain a core part of the conversations, discussions and conferences the association engages in. However, he emphasized that he hopes to meet the demands of corporations and industry leaders that are interested in the term “Distributed Ledger Technology.”“Bitcoin should always be part of the conversation but the industry has gone through something of a gentrification period in the past year and many corporations now prefer the term ‘DLT’ – Distributed Ledger Technology – to describe it,” said Godfrey.The most urgent and timely issue the association must address is the regulatory conflicts surrounding the implementation of the Blockchain technology. Godfrey and the rest of the Blockchain association hope to establish a nationwide framework for the technology in the short-term.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Blockchain News    #Ireland    #FinTech  
Blockchain Industry In 2017: Ready For New Exploits,Iyke Aru,12/10/2016 15:00,675,428,"The year 2016 has been a very active year for the Blockchain with several ideas and innovations flooding the industry. We have seen different creations by a lot of companies emerge, all presenting their functional real case uses for the disruptive technology.Governments and banks have also not been left behind in the developmental processes of the Blockchain, as we have seen a number of tests and implementation of the Blockchain at these levels.Reviewing the year ending 2016, principal consultant at Bankcoin Reserve Pty Ltd, Thomas McAlister, says that we have seen great exposure for Blockchain technology. According to McAlister, this exposure was mainly motivated by the race for market capture, as many companies made efforts to showcase their product within this emerging industry in order to achieve meaningful followership as early as possible.McAlister thinks that 2017 will be a year of patent litigation and heavy negotiations as the dust begins to settle and pieces of the puzzle start becoming adjusted. McAlister believes this necessary for the industry to assume a proper formation.He says:“We have seen Proof of Work (POW) run its course and expose its limitations. I believe Proof of Stake (POS) will play a major dominant role in the market moving forward, in particular loans and deposits, superannuation and value asset exchange, which will essentially mean that a more stable and flexible financial instrument will become more visible. I am excited for what's to come in 2017.”President at Crypto Consultant, Jason Cassidy, believes that 2016 will be remembered as the year that Blockchain technology's impact was felt beyond the realm of financial services.According to Cassidy, healthcare, identification, real estate, voting, gaming, tourism and even gold all made news on a global scale, powered by Blockchain technology.Cassidy also identifies some of the trends or events in the Blockchain space from this year that have helped define the landscape going into 2017.With the increased awareness of the technology and pressure to provide a legal framework, governments have begun taking a closer look at what a Blockchain is and what it can do for them. This acknowledgment, according to Cassidy, is an important development in the on-going story of global Bitcoin and Blockchain adoption.Cassidy observes the perceived overwhelming trend of ICO's that poured into the Blockchain ecosystem, describing the phenomenon as hitting a new level of hype and awareness in 2016. So much so that many regulators across the world are now taking a closer look at this new investment mechanism.He says:“Every day we have a new Blockchain offering in the form of an ICO. It is now at the point where it is becoming a sub-industry of its own.”  Cassidy made reference to the DAO incidence which occurred around the middle of the year. He says that for many in the industry, the incidence was a watershed moment which brought about a controversy and ultimate decision that some feel goes against the very ethos of decentralization. He notes that few events had a more polarizing effect in the Blockchain industry, even making it into mainstream news.  The increase in Blockchain awareness is also a development which Cassidy sees as significant:“Whether it is local meetups, facebook groups, educational courses or major conferences, Blockchain’s profile grew leaps and bounds over the past twelve months. Groups like Hyperledger are also helping growth in this vein by promoting collaboration across many levels.”He also notes that major corporations are joining the fray by creating brand new Blockchain products and services and helping to ensure they are not disrupted by a competitor as industries of scale entered the Blockchain race en masse in 2016. “This is can only mean good things as the threshold of innovation is set to be challenged once again.” As far as what the community can expect from the Blockchain space in 2017, Cassidy predicts a continuation of mainly the same processes.Cassidy says that as adoption grows, many of these trends will continue to play out and inevitably give way to new ones.Cassidy says:“We are still in the bottom of the first inning of a nine-inning ball game with regards to where the technology is at.”Two areas which he identifies as desperately requiring improvement next year is talent recruitment and education. He says that the education will naturally filter down and help out the talent recruitment as more and more people enter the space. Cassidy notes that presently, there are too many people in the industry that do not yet possess a true understanding of what Blockchain is, giving rise to limitations on what can and cannot be done viably on a Blockchain. “Better education around the technology is critical,” he says.Cassidy concludes by stating his belief that there will be more regulatory involvement in the realm of ICO's as currently, many investors who take part rarely possess the requisite knowledge about the technologies being promoted. This leaves investors in a situation where they are making less informed investment decisions. He concludes:“This is part and parcel of why I am working with regulators and other governments. There does need to be some level of protection to the investor. To offer this requires a better understanding of the process behind ICO's themselves and the technology behind each offering. This is where I come into the picture to offer that guidance. You can expect big things in 2017 for Blockchain technology. The future truly has never been brighter.”",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #ICO    #Thomas McAlister    #Jason Cassidy  
"Smart Money, Dumb Contracts: How Fat Cats Can Eat Blind Mice",S. Matthew English,12/5/2016 15:18,297,159,"Regulation is a game of cat and mouse. In the age of high-frequency trading, the time honored equilibrium in the feedback loop of pursuit, capture and escape is becoming increasingly distorted.Long and arduous is the process by which financial regulation is conceived and implemented, taking on the order of months to fully realize.This is a classical procedure which traces its roots back to an age where commodities crossed the Atlantic on schooners and the code of conduct was scrawled out longhand with quill pens. In those days of yore, if legislation contained a failure or loophole it could be exploited only so many times before it was possible to stem the breach.Our digital age is described by, among other things, adaptive machine learning processes that are capable of executing transactions in fractions of a second. As such, while the time horizon during which legislative oversights might remain vulnerable has generally remained constant, our ability to exploit them has increased by a degree previously unimaginable. The Flash Crash of 2010 was a trillion-dollar stock market collapse that started and ended during a period of approximately 36 minutes.In his recent book ‘Our Revolution,’ Bernie Sanders prides himself on a filibuster which lasted eight hours. That means that while Bernie was so eloquently holding forth on the floor of the United States Senate, the American economy could have experienced more than 13 consecutive trillion-dollar stock market crashes.It would seem that there is a fundamental discrepancy between the way our modern financial markets function and the way they are policed. The financial industry is fiercely competitive and encourages a Darwinian impetus to improvement. The legislative industry labors under no such compunctions. In the cat and mouse struggle previously alluded to, it seems the so-called “fat cats” have grown considerably more fleet than the “blind mice” of justice. The investigations of the Flash Crash were said to be prolonged due to the fact that regulators figuratively used the equivalent of bicycles in an effort to apprehend speeding Ferraris. In essence, regulations can be thought of as a “contract.”Machine learning algorithms can grow and adapt in seconds or less, while regulation takes on the order of months or more. It would seem that were regulation to keep up it would need to be more fluid, more adaptable.How could this be possible? Perhaps what is called for is a smart contract-based regulatory environment that can adapt in accordance with a predetermined set of parameters, to the behaviors of market participants. It’s an anomalous state of affairs that in the native land of Sir Jonathan Ive, Charles Babbage, Alan Turing, Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley and the Spice Girls that there are so precious few world renowned tech companies (should we count DeepMind?).In fact, one of the only vibrant and globally competitive industries that remain in Great Britain is financial services. Accordingly, the Bank of England and the rest of the city are quite keen on keeping abreast of the emerging trends in so-called “FinTech.”It stands to reason then that the Financial Conduct Authority recently organized their first Tech Sprint (viz. Hackathon), inviting innovators from around the world to come to Cambridge and demo the latest advances in the field. Of the organizations in attendance ‘eccenca GmbH’ of Leipzig unanimously blew away those in attendance with the presentation of a framework pioneering a new architecture for logic based regulation.At a high level, this equates to describing regulation in machine-readable computer code, a necessary prerequisite to smart contract based regulation. We find ourselves today in the undesirable situation of attempting to govern digital-age technology with depression-era legislation.Five years after the Flash Crash, traders can still manipulate and impact markets using automated trade systems that have only increased in sophistication.The logic based corporate governance model of eccenca and other similar initiatives are leading the charge in achieving some semblance of parity in the struggle to maintain regularity in the global financial system.One year ago the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the United States established a regime of regulatory requirements circumscribing the requisite margin on trades between swap dealers and other firms that weren’t routed through clearinghouses.This policy as released at the time contained a glaring loophole which essentially constituted carte blanche for banks to shift the targeted swaps business overseas with impunity. It was five long months before that hole was identified and corrective measures were taken.In the interim how much strain was put on the financial system? How much tax revenue was forfeit? How much additional risk was borne by the world economy? For the majority of human civilization, the lives of people in their local communities remained substantially unchanged, with respect to technology or culture, across the decades.If your father was born in a small shtetl with no running water or electricity it was likely that you would live out the course of your own life in the same way, in the same place. It was likely that your children, your children’s children, and so on, would do the same. This epoch is over. My own life began in the year that hallmarked the modern age, with Tim Berners-Lee’s invention of the World Wide Web and the ceremonious dismemberment of the Berlin Wall (“Antifaschistischer Schutzwall”).All of us alive today have born witness to the dizzying pace of technological and social change that describes our times. The tempo of this change is ever hastening, like the power ballad ""Freebird"" by the American rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. This epoch has just begun. The time for ideas and institutions of the past epoch is quickly running out. The time for modernization is now. Change is the only constant.From smart contracts to smart regulations we can rest assured that these shifting dynamics will present sizable opportunities for those who are prepared to seize them.",[],  #Blockchain News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Smart Contracts    #Economy  
"China Restricts Gold Importation, Increasing Bitcoin Demand",Joseph Young,12/4/2016 12:50,584,897,"Last week, Cointelegraph reported that the Indian government had planned to ban the importation of gold and impose heavy taxes on gold investors. On Dec. 1, China also restricted the importation of gold in order to prevent capital leaving the country.Over the past few months, the Chinese central bank and government have imposed heavy financial regulations for capital controls, cracking down on Wealth Management Products (WMPs), foreign investment and the transfer of money.The latest strategy implemented to prevent the devaluation of yuan is the restriction of the importation of gold. The government aims to achieve this through the disapproval of licenses and requests by banks and major financial institutions to import gold from international sellers.Prior to a report by the Financial Times and local Chinese media networks, the Chinese central bank maintained a policy on the restriction of the exportation of gold. The inability of Chinese investors and traders to monetize the precious metal significantly devalued gold in the Chinese market.In the upcoming weeks, China plans to strictly regulate the importation of gold to avoid the Chinese yuan from leaving the country. With the yuan falling 5.8 percent against the dollar already this year, the Chinese central bank and authorities are in a desperate struggle to recover the value of the yuan.In 2014, the People’s Bank of China authorized the Shanghai Gold Exchange to establish an international board to open the local Chinese gold market to foreign investors. A year later, the Shanghai Gold Exchange launched daily gold auctions, allowing investors to purchase large sums of gold with ease.In most regions, gold is the go-to safe haven asset for investors, traders and companies. Particularly in countries like China that have heavy regulations on foreign investments, gold is a relatively safe asset which presents substantially low volatility rate and high global exchange rates.Although the current restrictions on gold importation could potentially lead to a surge in demand for gold, current regulations on gold exportation refrain investors and traders from monetizing gold for foreign reserve currencies. Thus, it is highly likely that the newly proposed regulations on gold will convince investors, companies and traders to seek out other safe haven assets with high liquidity and solid global exchange rates.China has a large over-the-counter market for Bitcoin, primarily due to the large population of Bitcoin miners. Since the direct trading of Bitcoin between two parties in the absence of a moderator or a third party institution is exempted from money transmission regulations, Bitcoin could be seen as a viable method of investment and wealth protection for most companies and investors in China.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #China    #Gold  
"Blockchain-based BitLendingClub Shuts Down, Cites Regulatory Pressure",William Suberg,12/1/2016 15:34,311,180,"The world’s largest Blockchain lending marketplace, BitLendingClub, has announced its sudden shutdown due to what it describes as regulatory pressure.The Bulgarian-registered startup has operated since 2014 and has funded almost 10 thousand loans worth in excess of $7 mln. Now, its operations are ceasing, with existing users retaining minimal functionality in order to move funds out.“We’ve worked extremely hard to build a platform and a community which is uniquely positioned to provide the Bitcoin ecosystem with a greatly needed service,” a blog post released today states.The company adds:“However, over the last year or so, the regulatory pressures has been increasing to the point that it is no longer feasible to maintain the operation of the platform. We are regretfully announcing that we will have to begin (sic) terminating the services effective immediately.”The functionality will begin to be reduced from next week.The move reflects the continued difficulties faced by cryptocurrency-based finance startups with regards to legislation. While the EU has been fairly accommodating to disruptive finance overall, as witnessed in activity in the Netherlands, ensuring businesses conform to the requirements can overbearingly restrict functionality.BitLendingClub said the shutdown was part of the reality of operating a business in the Bitcoin ecosystem. “Given that we’ve reached the point where it is no longer feasible to run the platform and be compliant, we have decided to terminate the platform,” the company explained.As recently as September, BitLendingClub was still growing, launching its latest additional tool called Loanbase. Focused on the Latin American market, Loanbase was designed to provide funding to small and medium-sized businesses. It is unclear whether the offshoot will continue to operate in the absence of its parent.Meanwhile, other Bitcoin lending platforms continue to thrive.

Indian Supreme Court Asks Government to Regulate Bitcoin,Joshua Althauser,11/16/2017 12:55,8547,339,"The Supreme Court of India has called on the government to answer the petition calling for the regulation of the use of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin in the country.The petition claimed that the digital currency can be utilized in executing untraceable transactions across borders, making it an attractive tool for tax evaders and ransomware attackers.According to a report by the Indian newspaper, The Hindu, in mid-November 2017, three justices of the Supreme Court have sent a notice to India’s central bank, market regulator, tax department and other responsible agencies, requesting them to answer a petition on the issue.Part of the petition reads:""The lack of any concrete [control] mechanism pending the regulatory framework in said regard has left a lot of vacuum and which has resulted in total unaccountability and unregulated Bitcoin (crypto money) trading and transactions.""Based on the petition, the users of Bitcoin in India are continuously growing. It further claimed that Bitcoin exchanges in the country add 2,500 users per day and roughly 500,000 Indian citizens already have Bitcoin holdings. These developments could adversely affect the market value of other commodities in the country.The petition also cited some of the actions taken by other countries regarding Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Among these are the campaign against cryptocurrency exchanges in China and the move by the Russian government to block Bitcoin websites.Because of these actions, the petition also urged the Supreme Court to intervene and ask the government to urgently decide how it will approach the issue.The government of India has virtually adopted a “wait-and-see” attitude on the digital currency issue.In April 2017, it created a committee to study Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and how to best regulate them.

"EU To End Geoblocking For Digital Currency Users, Blockchain, Bitcoin Wallets Affected",William Suberg,2/21/2017 12:25,291,245,"The European Union is seeking to end geoblocking of citizens in member states who use digital currencies.A draft outline by the European Union Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection “aims to lift any unjustified barriers in e-commerce and to be a decisive step towards the completion of the Digital Single Market.”Geoblocking is the process of displaying certain content - or banning certain content - for internet users based on their physical location.The EU is slowly eradicating the practice, notably when German copyright association GEMA allowed citizens to access music content on YouTube after a multi-year hiatus. However, banned content has always been available through the use of VPN connections.Addressing Blockchain-based technologies directly, the EU states:“... [The] Commission should assess whether to provide the legal framework that allows, subject to the freedom of contract principle, the protection of undertakings and consumers when the transaction is carried through alternative modes of payment, including virtual currencies, other Blockchain type transactions and e - wallets.”The move is the latest in a series of noises the bloc has made about digital currency regulation, having previously announced stricter anti-money laundering policies in July last year.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Digital Currency    #Bitcoin Wallet    #Payments  
Kim Dotcom Faces US Extradition Despite Copyright Victory,William Suberg,2/20/2017 9:55,280,123,"Megaupload and Bitcache creator Kim Dotcom is likely to be extradited to the US, despite a New Zealand judge clearing him of local copyright infringement.Dotcom’s ongoing legal case over the first incarnation of his MegaUpload file sharing site was previously dubbed the “largest criminal copyright case.”Now, it appears he and three associates may yet find themselves in the US facing trial on 13 counts “including allegations of conspiracy to commit racketeering, copyright infringement, money laundering and wire fraud since 2012,” local news resource New Zealand Herald reports.The result is a serious mixed blessing for Dotcom, whose legal team had been attempting to clear his name of copyright infringement for several years. Under New Zealand law, distributing copyrighted material to users online is not a criminal offense.“As we have said all along, there is no such offense under our Copyright Act. We were right,” Dotcom’s lawyer Ron Mansfield said.""To win the major plank of the case but to get that outcome is extremely disappointing. It is hard to accept the logic that, if the conduct that all accept at its heart relates to assertions of breach of copyright... how it can nonetheless be massaged into a general fraud offense.""Dotcom himself also tweeted his frustration at the ruling accusing him of the other counts:New Zealand Copyright Law (92b) makes it clear that an ISP can't be criminally liable for actions of their users.

Governments and Banks Push Bitcoin Price to New Levels: Experts,Iyke Aru,2/19/2017 12:54,701,1160,"Besides the global influx of new users, government wars and restrictions against Bitcoin appears to be toughening the resilience and character of the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin has exhibited a very strong price character so far in 2017 despite a number of setbacks. This is expressed by the manner in which its price has always shown good strength in recovery.Alena Vranova, co-founder of SatoshiLabs / TREZOR, says:“All those setbacks, hurdles and government restrictions are a blessing, making Bitcoin more resilient. The fact that Bitcoin hit $1000 for the second time in its short history also strengthened its position even more and set expectations quite high for this year.”Simon Dixon, BnkToTheFuture.com CEO, believes that Bitcoin’s continued strength as a global store of value has been supercharged by two factors in 2017.Firstly, Dixon notes that banks and financial instructions around the globe waved the Blockchain flag throughout 2016 and many more are starting to realize that Blockchains are pretty useless without Bitcoin’s proof of work.The result, according to Dixon has been a wave of Blockchain applications that are worse than their existing solutions and a realization that Bitcoin is actually the only interesting thing about Blockchain.Secondly, Dixon says that governments are essentially subsidizing the growth of Bitcoin, driving people to it by waging war on their national cash supply and adding more and more friction to fiat money in their war on money laundering that is affecting everyday people that are not laundering anything.“These two factors are driving more and more people to buy some Bitcoin and experience what it is like to own their own money,” concludes Dixon.Michael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins, describes Bitcoin as having a breakout year in terms of new users and continued adoption on a global scale.Vogel tells Cointelegraph that 2017 is proving to be a very exciting year for Bitcoin, despite having seen major regulatory uncertainties in China with some exchanges halting withdrawals.Vogel explains:“Speaking from my viewpoint at Netcoins, a large portion of our customer base continues to be new customers that are discovering Bitcoin for the first time and have made the decision to load up their new Bitcoin wallet. In fact, January was a record month for traffic at our Virtual Bitcoin ATMs.”Vogel thinks that the overall upward trend in Bitcoin price is as a result of the influx of new users globally. This is because, despite hiccups and negative press, the global Bitcoin trading and transaction volumes continue to grow. This is reflected in the 24-hour volume history of main Bitcoin exchanges over the past year.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #Bitcoin Price  
We Shouldn’t “Kill” Bitcoin But Regulate: Former Bank of China Governor to CCTV,Joseph Young,2/15/2017 12:20,718,467,"During an interview with China Central Television (CCTV), a predominant state television broadcaster, L H Li, the former governor of Bank of China, one of the largest banks owned by the Chinese government, and member of the People’s Congress, stated that the Chinese central bank should try to regulate Bitcoin companies and users rather than attempting to stop the adoption of Bitcoin.Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer and decentralized architecture with the absence of centralized government and authority. Anyone within the network can initiate a transaction and payments are confirmed, verified and embedded into the public Blockchain by miners around the world.The Bitcoin network can’t be banned, blocked, censored and taken over, due to its unprecedented security measures represented by its hash rate.Li understands that the decentralized architecture which underpins the Bitcoin network is ungovernable.He emphasized during an interview broadcasted by CCTV that it is virtually an “impossible task” to stop or “kill” the Bitcoin network. He described Bitcoin as a network “built on a platform without national boundaries.”In 2013, many governments including the Chinese government attempted to ban the usage of Bitcoin. It quickly led to a massive decline in the value of Bitcoin but recovered over time as users began to realize that the network is based on a peer-to-peer protocol and that the government has no authority over Bitcoin.Governments started to develop similar awareness of Bitcoin to the general population. Three years later since its initial imposition of a nationwide “ban on Bitcoin,” PBoC decided to regulate the market and provide increased stability and reliability to users instead of unproductively striving to decrease mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.As a result, the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market has seen the formation of a healthy relationship between regulators and Chinese Bitcoin exchanges that are cooperating with each other in order to establish industry-wide standards and remain compliant with local regulations.Noted by Li, the Chinese government and its central bank have moved on from their initial strategy of creating an inconvenient environment and ecosystem for users and businesses. Instead, it actually provided a regulatory framework which has better served the global Bitcoin exchange market, with the elimination of inflated trading volumes and margin trading.Most of the requests Chinese regulators demanded local Bitcoin exchanges to comply with apart from the suspension of withdrawals for OKCoin and Huobi users have been relatively reasonable.The Central Bank of China believes that Bitcoin will prosper and continue to exist. It is at the advantage of regulators to monitor the growth of Bitcoin and assist the mainstream market adoption of the digital currency as bitcoin will become even harder to regulate and oversee if most of its trading and transactions are done in underground and over-the-counter markets.Recently, Cointelegraph covered an article entitled “LocalBitcoins’ New Chinese Popularity Sparks Fears of PBoC Action,” which demonstrated the migration of traders from Huobi and OKCoin moving over to peer-to-peer and over-the-counter trading platform LocalBitcoins in fear of the suspension of trading.Within hours after Huobi and OKCoin announced the temporary termination of trading, LocalBitcoins volume began to surge, representing the potential market for underground trading and over-the-counter deals.In the near future, the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market will see the growth of a market that is widely accepted by the general population and is more reliable in terms of regulatory compliance.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #China    #Government

"India’s Central Bank Cracks Down on Bitcoin Again, Cautions Citizen Against it",Shivdeep Dhaliwal,2/7/2017 12:14,801,299,"There has been a flurry of central bank activity recently spewing advice and cautioning citizens about virtual currencies like Bitcoin.First, it was PBOC and now the recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India’s central bank has come up with a press release that warns Indians about the dangers of dabbling in virtual currencies.On Feb. 1, 2017, the Reserve Bank of India posted a  brief press release on their website saying, “The Reserve Bank of India had cautioned users, holders and traders of Virtual Currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to, vide its press release dated Dec. 24, 2013. The Reserve Bank of India advises that it has not given any license/ authorization to any entity/ company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. As such, any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with Virtual Currencies will be doing so at their own risk.”As is clear from the central bank’s communique, they had also earlier issued a similarly worded caution way back in 2013.What is interesting to note about the press release by the Indian central bank is the timing. The Reserve Bank carried out a botched demonetization on Nov. 8, 2016, which wiped out 86 percent of the circulating currency in India. Indian citizens had to endure months of pain afterward and there was a renewed interest in Bitcoin.In fact, Bitcoin is extracting a premium in India, at the time of the writing of this article 1 BTC was worth $1041 on Poloniex but on the Indian Bitcoin exchange ZebPay 1 BTC was worth INR$72,790 or $1080 approx.Recently the government of India presented its Union Budget and the Indian finance minister announced further curbs on cash which included a 100 percent penalty on cash usage above Rs.$300,000. This warning on Bitcoin comes just days after the penalty was announced.It should be absolutely clear to anyone who is using Bitcoin in India that the usage of Bitcoin is not in violation of any of the country’s laws and the Reserve Bank notice does not affect Bitcoin or any other virtual currency adversely.We talked with Kumar Gaurav, CEO Cashaa.com who says, “There is no major impact of this comment. Average consumers are still not involved in Bitcoin in India, yes a little pro consumers with extra cash are only looking for an alternate investment which can be highly liquid. And as they are pro, they know what they are doing and are willing to take risks.”India has very strict capital controls in place. The infamous Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) imposes several restrictions on resident Indians who can’t hold foreign exchange in cash beyond $2000, in such times Bitcoin may be attractive to certain Indians who may not want to be subject to India’s cash limits or store their wealth in a depreciating rupee that has lost nearly half its value since March 2011 against the dollar.So the RBI warning may also be the central bank exercising its capital control duties as Kumar Gaurav points out, “RBI has many responsibilities than just printing currencies and one of them is capital control measures.  India has strict capital control rules and anything which will make it weaker, obviously not accepted by the central bank. But at the same time, India does not want to kill innovation; it does not want to ban cryptocurrencies - it wants to understand its effect more closely.”While the RBI may have been cautionary in its approach, the truth is that nothing has changed in India when it comes to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies except the fact that the central bank’s own actions have spurred more interest in alternatives to the Rupee.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #India    #Reserve Bank of India  
Bitcoin Price Will Skyrocket If It Becomes World’s Reserve Currency by 2020,Iyke Aru,2/4/2017 12:37,7780,2199,"The knee-jerk approach of governments around the world towards Bitcoin and Blockchain leave room for a lot of questions. The actions of the regulatory agencies as it concerns this disruptive technology shows an element of panic and confusion.Just recently, the governor of the Central Bank of the UAE reversed an earlier statement by the government which contained “all virtual currencies and transactions thereof are prohibited.”In a statement to Gulf News clarifying the regulation, Mubarak Rashid Khamis Al Mansouri, Governor of the Central Bank, said:“These regulations do not cover ‘virtual currency’, which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a form of stored value. In this context, these regulations do not apply to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, currency exchanges or underlying technology such as Blockchain.”The UAE is not an isolated situation because we have seen similar developments in Nigeria, where the Central Bank, after advising the public against investing in digital currencies returned a few days later with a circular requesting banks to produce nominees into a committee that will produce the policies and guidelines that will guide Blockchain regulation in Nigeria.A number of reasons have been identified for the perceived ‘back and forth’ behavior of government towards Bitcoin and Blockchain.Michael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins sees the inadequate understanding of Bitcoin by the lawmakers as one of the major reasons for the sporadic reversals in government position on Bitcoin.“If all cryptocurrenies are banned, then does that mean that businesses wouldn't be allowed to use Blockchain-based ledgers and databases?” asks Vogel. “What about smart contracts or digital assets tied to the Bitcoin Blockchain?”Perhaps from the government’s perspective, it is easier to ban than regulate or perhaps they realize after the fact that a ban would be difficult or impossible to enforce.Vogel points out that regulation or lack thereof continues to be a delicate matter and a strain for those looking to use Bitcoin legitimately. He says that in some ways, a wait-and-see approach to regulation is good because over-regulation can stifle innovation. However, a lack of legal clarity can also make it difficult for Bitcoin businesses to operate.Vogel concludes:“There have been predictions about Bitcoin actually becoming a government world reserve currency by 2020. This would skyrocket Bitcoin price, although by 2020 who knows how high the price will already be.”Simon Dixon, CEO of  BnkToTheFuture.com describes the actions of government as a ‘dilemma.’Dixon says that the initial reaction of governments usually reveals some level of emotional response in the form of fear and panic. Therefore, their initial reaction is most often knee-jerk.He also explains that what usually follows is that these governments then dig deeper only to realize that their banks want to explore Blockchain technology- a code word for Bitcoin. Then their central banks realize that digital currency can help them rage war on cash. In the end, they flip-flop their announcements realizing that Bitcoin may be something they have to put up with to achieve their goals of creating a worse version of Bitcoin and supporting their banks with their 'Blockchain' buzz-word.However, Dixon notes that this development is not new in the ecosystem as it has been a pattern across the globe.He says:“It is a fun game to watch. It happened first in the US, followed by China and now it is the turn of Africa and the Middle-East.”",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies    #Bitcoin Price  
Overstock Sees Share Price Drop After Subsidiary Becomes Target Of SEC Probe,Molly Jane Zuckerman,3/2/2018 14:22,22347,152,"Overstock.com, which was the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin (BTC) in 2014, has seen its shares fall after its crypto subsidiary tZERO reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was looking into its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), according to tZERO’s Mar. 1 “Confidential Private Placement Offering Memorandum.”Overstock had experienced a share price climb in October of last year to around $34, as more investors were becoming excited about Blockchain and crypto. Overstock is currently trading at around $56 after falling more than 10% on Mar. 1.On Feb. 28, anonymous sources had told the WSJ that the SEC had launched a probe into cryptocurrencies-related businesses, with as-of-yet unknown numbers of information requests and subpoenas already delivered to crypto companies. The SEC has also recently suspended trading of three companies while investigating their cryptocurrency and Blockchain assets.Under a section marked “Legal Proceedings,” the tZERO filing records that the SEC’s Division of Enforcement had told the company in February that it was conducting an investigation and had asked for the voluntary handover of “certain documents related to the Offering and the Tokens in connection with its investigation.”The March 1 filing also contains a list of “Cautionary Statements” about the future, including the stipulation that there “can be no assurance that the Tokens will ever be issued and Tokens, if issued, will be subject to extensive legal and contractual transfer restrictions to comply with our regulatory obligations.” The list also includes mentions of the “uncertain nature” of the tax treatment, application of US law, and regulatory regime of these securities.The filing reports that the company is cooperating with the SEC in its investigation, but adds that“While the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law.  Also, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity, or security.”Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Overstock, told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) yesterday, March 1, that the SEC “clearly doing a sweep of this whole industry,” a move that he “actually supports:”“The more of a regulatory spotlight they bring, the better we look.”According to Byrnes, the SEC has been “in the dark” about ICOs, and most offerings are actually securities, even if they don’t market themselves as such:“We all know they’re securities.”Overstock had filed for its ICO to be classified under Regulations D and S instead of as a traditional securities filing. This means that US citizens must be accredited investors (net worth that exceeds $1 million, or an annual income of at least $200,000) to have invested in the ICO, and that offshore transactions must not involve US citizens.The SEC filing reported that the ICO, which was launched in December 2017, raised $100.6 mln from 1,100 investors, and that $250 mln is the maximum amount of tokens to be issued. TZERO’s website says that the “Private Offering” had been extended until March 30, 2018.In January of this year, the Eastman Kodak Company’s announcement that they would be releasing their own ICO under the same “exempt offering” guidelines saw doubling of their stock price, but its launch date was postponed in order to finish verifying the status of their accredited investors.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #SEC    #ICO    #Cryptocurrencies    #Overstock

As poor banking decisions and practices faced a rude awakening by coming to a crashing halt, this allowed for new ideas to emerge, garner attention and be put in to use, especially in Japan, the Land of the Rising Sun.As the credit crisis was in full force, Japan passed its Basic Space Law, which established Space Solar Power – the concept of collecting solar power in outer space and distributing it to Earth via satellites – as a national goal with the Japanese Space Exploration Agency. On January 9 2009, a new triple-entry accounting ledger system and the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin made its world debut by the programmer using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.Nine years after Bitcoin launched, the economic, social and political implications of the crisis are still being felt around the world. Globally, treasury departments continue to face funding deficits with no simple resolution in sight, and the ensuing significant increases in government debt have produced several sovereign debt crises. Ultra-low interest rates from central banks trying to combat deflation have left investors scratching their heads for places to find returns on their cash.These economic conditions led to a heightened interest in Bitcoin as an alternative investment class, since correlation with other asset classes is virtually nil, a perfect diversifier. Japan currently ranks as the largest Bitcoin market with a share of over 61 percent of global trading volume and 2.7 percent of the population holds BTC.Softbank Group CEO Masayoshi Son, Japan's wealthiest citizen - who is changing startup technology investing with his large checkbook, upending Silicon Valley finance - refers to these technological developments as the ‘‘disruptive, foundational technologies that are building the infrastructure for tomorrow.’’ In 2017 Masayoshi Son, backed by investors who gave him on average $1 bln per minute, launched a $100 bln technology-focused “SoftBank Vision Fund” in partnership with tech companies Apple, Qualcomm, Foxconn, and Sharp. And because investing in BTC is considered halal, investors in the fund also include Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company. More foreign country wealth funds are eager to gain access to shares and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in tech companies, and are pushing for a second SoftBank Vision Fund, which plans to raise about $880 bln.Masayoshi Son believes that with improvements both in Internet connectedness and solar power utilization, there will continue to be more global demand for digital assets. As a result, he has made investments in low earth orbit satellite company OneWeb and in solar power businesses all around the world.   Japan has a ravenous appetite for cryptocurrencies. The first Bitcoin exchange - Bitcoin Market - was established there on February 6 2010, when BTC traded for $0.30. However the exchange was shut down six months later after being scammed. In the aftermath, Japanese Mt. Gox quickly rose to prominence during the same year but met its end four years later after being hacked. This was the largest heist of a BTC exchange at the time, which has been recently superseded by the $530 mln hack of an unregistered exchange Coincheck (Japan). Coincheck is not alone, as crypto-related cybercrime is on the rise, with users and exchanges struggling to keep up with hackers and the constantly evolving methods they employ to steal money and information.So Saito, partner at Japanese law firm So-Law, explains that “The first BTC regulations in Japan were proposed after the Mt. Gox hack, when the Banking Act and the Act on the Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds was amended, to prohibit banks and securities companies from dealing in BTC for customer accounts without registration, but allowing for proprietary trading in Bitcoin. These laws came into effect on April 1 2017, along with the Payment Services Act recognizing cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, granting them the same legal status as any other currency. So far the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan has granted licenses to sixteen cryptocurrency exchanges.”After history’s biggest Coincheck hack, the FSA stepped up its efforts to investigate Bitcoin exchanges, as well as Bitcoin’s illicit use in money laundering transactions. The FSA is also pushing for the merger of two business groups  –  the Japan Blockchain Association and the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association – to establish a general incorporated association under the revised Payment Services Act in order to create a regulatory framework applicable to the crypto industry.This is important as regulations have allowed SoftBank Investment, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mizuho Financial Group Inc., and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company to continue to invest in Bitcoin exchanges to the point of making Japan the top Bitcoin Exchange market in the world, beating out both China and the US.The ICO market in Japan is on fire. Taizo Son, Masayoshi Son’s younger brother and founder and CEO of venture capital firm Mistletoe, predicts that ICOs, which democratize the fundraising process, will come to dominate start-up fundraising.Currently, no laws are governing ICOs but on October 27 2017, the FSA published a statement clarifying its position on ICOs:“ICOs may fall within the scope of the Payment Services Act and/or Financial Instruments and Exchange Act depending on how they are structured”.In February the FSA warned an unregistered foreign ICO agency whose activities could cause investors to incur losses. Japan’s Ministry of Finance also warned an investment firm and a questionable ICO.When Japan lifted its 8 percent national consumption tax on cryptocurrency sales in July 2017, it kick-started their across-the-board meteoric price rise. But the non-taxable nature of cryptocurrency transactions turned out to be short-lived. On September 6 2017, the National Tax Agency (Kokuzeichou) declared that profits from using cryptocurrencies were subject to individual income tax, classified as “miscellaneous income”, except for cases arising in association with activities that generate business income, such as digital currency mining, or actively trading. Miners can subtract mining overheads like facilities, power consumption, etc. from their final profit.The top federal tax rate applicable to individual taxpayers in Japan for 2017 is higher than in the US, where it is 39.6 percent. Unlike winnings on stocks and foreign currencies, which are taxed around 20 percent, Japan’s levy on profits from cryptocurrency runs from 15 percent to 45 percent for investors who receive annual remuneration over  ¥20,000,000 ($176,500) per year and miscellaneous income above ¥200,000 ($1,765). A further 10% of municipal taxes are added at every income level.In essence this tax season, all users of cryptocurrencies will need to adopt the kind of meticulous record-keeping and price-tracking measures currently seen in the US where cryptocurrency profits will be calculated at the time of conversion into JPY (¥) and then declared in annual tax filings due between Feb.16 and March 15 2018.The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taxes    #ICO  
The Bitcoin Community Reacts to the NY BitLicense,Tom Jackson,6/4/2015 14:27,552,0,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) yesterday released the third and final revisions to its BitLicense legislation.The updates are aimed at improving functionality within the industry and making sure businesses are compliant without stifling innovation. Two previous versions of the regulations received much criticism and the third is no different.Here are some Bitcoin community reactions to the updated NY BitLicense:Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO, Kraken:“The heavy compliance costs on digital currency exchanges will make it much more difficult to operate a profitable exchange in the state. Many fear it will stifle innovation in the industry and exclude New York from the developing currency.” Perianne Boring, president, Chamber of Digital Commerce:“New York’s final BitLicense regulations are not perfect. The most worrisome aspect is the lack of a clear on-ramp for digital currency startups and small businesses, especially in the likelihood that other states will use New York’s BitLicense as a guideline in creating their own regulations. “With multiple states looking to regulate digital currencies, the industry is facing an increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory environment. It is imperative that the industry’s voice is heard in discussions among policymakers to ensure what ultimately becomes law does not impede innovation. “Without proper engagement, we risk a patchwork of inconsistencies and friction between local, state, federal and international laws.” Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research, Coin Center:“It has failed to address our two top concerns: an overbroad definition of virtual currency business activity and an unprecedented and discriminatory state-level anti-money laundering regime. Our consolation today is that the future’s looking bright on the other coastline. The current draft of California’s equivalent legislation, AB 1326, is much better than the BitLicense. “It’s unfortunate that the BitLicense has been the focus of the media and many casual digital currency observers. In the superintendent’s own words: ‘We have never claimed to have a monopoly on the truth. And regulators must always be willing to course-correct when necessary.’ As it stands for now, California’s on a superior tack. In the race to develop rules that foster innovation and to do so thoughtfully, California is winning.” Ryan Selkis, director of investments, Digital Currency Group, objected to the failure to exclude multisig:“This is an inexcusable oversight. This point was highlighted repeatedly and loudly for past nine months. Defining and regulating key ‘custodians’ was literally the only area of incremental value you could offer: failure. Now that this is set in stone, let's call this oversight what it is: intellectual laziness. Very disappointed.” Juan Llanos, fintech analyst, on Twitter:The #Bitlicense ended up being remarkably similar to the existing regime. Was it really necessary? ICYMI: t.co/tfg8UE3S5E #Bitcoin Roger Ver, angel investor:“If someone about to do something productive has to ask a bureaucrat for permission, both they, and the bureaucrat, are kept from producing something of value, and the world is worse off as a result.” @ruperth responds to #bitlicense on Twitter:The final draft of the #bitlicense is exactly what everyone expected, draconic and uninspiring. At least #bitcoin isn't illegal! African StudiosGood thing valid transactions will be processed by the network according to #bitcoin protocol standards not #bitlicense standards. Not all of the responses were negative, however, with some members of the community expressing positive feelings and optimism over the new regulations.Ribbit.Me#bitlicense to exclude rewards programs. Full speed ahead for @RibbitRewards the first global rewards program built on blockchain tech! $RBR Ryan Walker@mpachniuk Like it or hate it #bitcoin #bitlicense allows a lot of projects / companies to move forward with clear expectations. Good thing? Jaron Lukasiewicz, NYC-based Coinsetter CEO, said:""As a New York City-based exchange, we have awaited regulatory clarity from New York that enables us to offer better deposit and withdrawal methods to customers. Most execs in the industry still feel that the final BitLicense rules are fairly ambiguous, but I hope the DFS will work with the industry to help it grow. My use of the word 'hope' highlights an issue we see with financial regulation today. There is an extreme lack of clarity from our perspective as an innovating company in terms of what will be required of us to obtain a license in any state. Coinsetter will submit an application to the NYDFS that we believe merits licensure. We will also continue pushing to offer innovative products that help enhance personal freedom and create low cost ways for the underbanked to transfer money. Our company has verbalized an understanding of working alongside regulation for many years now. Now that the BitLicense is approaching, I hope that the NYDFS and other state regulators will help support fast innovation in financial technology startups through extreme flexibility and low cost burden."" Brian Forde, director, MIT University's Digital Currency InitiativeBrian Forde says the final product “is good for consumers in New York who will get the innovative financial services of the future from upstart entrepreneurs and large companies, faster.”So will regulation help or hinder companies operating in the Bitcoin space? Will it put the  brakes to innovation? Ben Lawsky thinks not, but in truth only time will tell if New York has assisted or damaged the development of digital currencies, and whether other states will follow its example.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Community    #BitLicense    #NYDFS    #Kraken    #Perianne Boring    #Roger Ver    #MIT  
Coinbase to Stop Service in Wyoming Due to ‘Impractical’ Regulations,Jamie Redman,6/4/2015 11:27,266,0,"San-Francisco based bitcoin exchange Coinbase will be soon stop servicing customers in the state of Wyoming due to Wyoming Division of Banking’s regulatory standards that will make business in that state impractical, the company stated on their blog.The announcement reads:“Coinbase is indefinitely suspending its business in Wyoming.”The state’s recently introduced Wyoming Money Transmitter Act requires services to hold a 25% fiat reserve in order to operate by law. This means they must cover at least a quarter of the amount of reserves in fiat.With bitcoin being a relatively volatile asset it would be difficult to manage this task. Each licensee must maintain a surety bond or trust account in US dollars for the benefit of its customers. The bond is form of insurance that users must pay an annual premium to maintain, and thus, Coinbase believes it is too costly to continue business in Wyoming with this asset rule set in place.“The Wyoming Division of Banking has recently communicated regulatory policies which we believe will render continued Coinbase operations there impractical,” the company explained. “In particular, we understand that the Wyoming Division of Banking interprets the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act to require licensure of entities which offer hosted bitcoin wallet services, and that as a condition of such licensure, licensees must maintain dedicated fiat currency reserves in amount equal to the aggregate face value of all bitcoin held on behalf of customers.”The company added:“Although Coinbase securely maintains 100% of all customer bitcoin, it is impractical, costly, and inefficient for us to establish a redundant reserve of fiat currency in equivalent value.”Coinbase sent out emails to its users notifying that services will end in Wyoming in thirty days with no immediate plans to restore services anytime soon, stating:“We understand this suspension will inconvenience our Wyoming customers and we apologize that we cannot currently project if or when our services may be restored.”In a post made on Reddit about the subject, many users were concerned on how this would affect Coinbase services in New York With the BitLicense revealed, things could get tougher for businesses offering brokerage services.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Coinbase    #Wyoming    #Banking  
"NY BitLicense Released With Minor Revisions, Still ‘Vague and Discriminatory’",Evander Smart,6/3/2015 21:17,338,0,"The long-awaited final revisions to the precedent-setting New York State BitLicense regulatory program were released today by their architect, Ben Lawsky.New updates look to improve functionality and clarify the state regulators’ focus on how businesses in the digital currency industry can be more compliant, without hurting innovation. Lawsky, the Superintendent of Financial Services for the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released two previous versions that have been much-maligned within the Bitcoin community.Today, he wanted to assure the Bitcoin community that he was listening to their concerns and using reactions to improve the regulations going forward. Lawsky said at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington:“When facing new financial technologies, it is very important for regulators to look before they leap. Attempting to force novel technologies and business models into existing regulatory boxes, simply because ‘that is the way it has always been done,' may not be a sensible approach. We need, at times, to be more creative than that as regulators, even if it takes us outside our comfort zone.“Similarly, regulators also need to realize their own limitations; recognize what they do not know, and keep an open mind when approaching new technologies.”The final regulations include five different revisions to remove duplication, increase efficiency and make compliance easier for those affected. The changes include:The updates are fairly modest in the actual fabric of the BitLicense scope, but look to remove confusion and extra paperwork. This was not enough for some critics, however. Coin Report’s Executive Director Jerry Brito had the following to say in his company’s response to the revisions:“Despite the changes to anti-money laundering requirements that the superintendent cited in his speech, the final Bitlicense still creates an unprecedented and discriminatory state-level AML reporting obligation.”The new language is vague and unclear about how compliance with federal regulations will exempt a BitLicensee from those state-level obligations. My question is, if you register with FinCEN, do you have AML obligations to New York State? Other states are already looking to the BitLicense as a model for their own frameworks. We are working with them to ensure they do not repeat the mistakes made here.”The regulatory framework for Bitcoin in NY state began almost a year ago, in July of 2014, with the first proposed framework coming from Lawsky’s office. The amount of acrimony and derision generated over four thousand comments within the 90-day public commentary and review period.Lawsky says that these comments were all taken into consideration when the revised BitLicense framework was re-released in February. According to Lawsky, the number of comments dropped from over four thousand to just thirty-five when the second version was released, indicating that the revisions were much better received.Only time will tell if these revisions in this “final version” will make New York a more palatable place to do Bitcoin business in the future. If banks applaud the new regulation, Lawsky said in his press conference, it is a sign that the regulation is not quite right. Regulators will not please everyone. Any Bitcoin business lost will surely find a new home elsewhere in another state in the union, at least until that state models their future regulatory framework upon New York’s BitLicense.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #New York    #BitLicense    #Benjamin Lawsky    #NYDFS    #Bitcoin Community

Profitable miners will need to pay income tax over their earnings, however.Philippines-based bitcoin exchange Coinage has graduated from the Boost VC accelerator program in Silicon Valley, coming away with US$20,000 seed funding as well as ongoing access to the company’s network. Earlier this year the company entered Boost VC’s three-month accelerator program, having previously been self-funded as it built its exchange. Coinage CEO and co-founder, Anthony Giovanni Chua, said the startup was stoked to have been selected.He added:“As a bitcoin startup in the Philippines, the odds are stacked against you, but a chance like this - working with the very best in the industry, being mentored by tech and investing icons - is a leap forward in the best possible direction.”Instant Bitcoin and altcoin exchange service ShapeShift.io has partnered with CoinPayments.net, a cryptocurrency checkout system for merchants, through the integration of the ShapeShift API. The integration powers CoinPayment’s platform to allow merchants to receive various cryptocurrencies and automatically trade them for their digital asset of choice.CoinPayments CEO Alex Alexandrov commented:“We are excited to offer simple and frictionless conversions to our customers using the ShapeShift API. This partnership gets us one step closer to a system where customers can pay in any currency they choose and vendors settle in what they find most convenient for their business.”",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Hackers    #United Kingdom    #DigitalBTC    #ShapeShift    #Streamium    #Decentralization    #CoinPayments  
Coinapult Finds Solution to Crypto Regulation and Reopens Services to US,Charlie Richards,5/21/2015 9:15,569,0,"Coinapult partners with Crypto Capital to reopen in the U.S., meeting state financial regulations.Popular exchange and brokerage service Coinapult has announced a partnership with regulated financial services provider Crypto Capital. The move means that Coinapult can continue its operation as an exchange, wallet and brokerage service, while outsourcing their anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) duties to Crypto Capital.Explaining the benefit to the company, Coinapult issued a statement on May 20 describing how the they will no longer be handling their own financial regulation compliance work.“Coinapult will no longer request know-your-customer (KYC) documentation. This allows anyone to utilize Coinapult's pricing services and API without restriction. Crypto Capital will be performing KYC for customers who want to deposit or withdraw fiat currencies. Additionally, limits on account volumes have been lifted.”Cointelegraph has previously reported on the increasingly difficult set of regulations facing digital currency companies operating in the U.S. As a growing number of states begin drafting and applying their own financial requirements for these companies to meet, startups face a legal minefield when trying to remain compliant.Speaking on the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast of May 6, one of Coinapult's original co-founders Erik Voorhees, who subsequently left the company in January 2014, explained his earlier reasoning for closing the company's U.S. office and moving the operation to Panama.“[Governments] think that their fiat currencies will outlive Bitcoin, but they're wrong. Once they realize that they're going to become very hostile, and we basically didn't want to build a bitcoin company in the U.S. because of that.”Digging further into his experiences of the regulation and legal situation of digital currencies, Voorhees shared his more recent understanding that the problem lies with serving U.S. customers, rather than in having the operation based there.“It's far more important where your customers are than where you are. So it probably would have been just fine if Coinapult had stayed in the U.S., but just blocked the U.S. as a jurisdiction, so that customers from the U.S. couldn't use it. That's probably almost as good as leaving the country with the actual office and the people.”The company’s partnership with Crypto Capital makes sense from this point of view, as Voorhees has found a way for the company to serve U.S. customers, while avoiding the legal risks of needing to be compliant with the varying regulations of all 50 states.Crypto Capital will be taking on the legal responsibilities involved with checking customer's credentials and making sure that record keeping and fund processing meets the conditions set by customers’ countries and, in the case of the U.S., their state. The imminent release of the finalized BitLicense legislation in New York will be an early test of this arrangement, and a sign of things to come, as many states are expected to emulate the cryptocurrency regulation.Crypto Capital is a registered fiduciary, meaning they are authorized by their customers to hold assets and funds in trust on their behalf. In the case of digital currency companies, this means they are able to hold fiat and other funds in trust under separate Crypto Capital banking accounts. In this way, some of the legal obligations surrounding the holding of customer funds are transferred away from the client — in this case.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #AML    #KYC    #Coinapult    #Crypto Capital    #Partnership

The company, which is a public limited liability company incorporated under Swedish law, says this will make it easy for entities and individuals to trade in bitcoin.XBT Provider:“We are proud to offer the world’s first “Bitcoin tracker” to be traded on a regulated exchange. By enabling this easy and secure way to invest in Bitcoin we hope to have eliminated the boundaries that earlier prevented individuals and companies from being able to actively invest in what we believe to be the future of money.”In what has been interpreted as a sign of growing interest in Europe’s financial tech scene, Ireland’s CurrencyFair has raised $10.6 million in a round that was led by U.K.’s Octopus Investments.CurrencyFair CEO, Brett Meyers:“The money transfer sector has seen a lot of attention recently, with customers beginning to realize the high fees charged by banks when sending money internationally.”Volabit, a Bitcoin startup based in Puerto Vallarta Mexico, has launched a service that pays your phone bills, utilities, and other expenses with bitcoin through a computer bot. The payment is done with the help of the social networking app, Whatsapp.Relationship expert, Dr. Jochen Konrad has advised men to avoid Bitcoin related topics on the first date. On his tours, the dating expert believes that Bitcoin does not stimulate the imagination of women. Nevertheless, he himself is a Bitcoin fan and even accepts payment in digital currency for his books.Dr. Jochen Konrad:""I think bitcoin should not be discussed by guys, because that doesn't really stimulate the imagination of women or deliver any emotional cues.

This is expected to prevent the possibility of hackers hiding backdoors behind seemingly random data. The new feature will apply to both specialized hardware and general-purpose computers running wallet software.Oleg Andreev:“Hardware Bitcoin wallets are obvious targets for backdoors. We propose a unified method of auditing any wallet for presence of potential backdoors or bugs. The specification also applies to software wallets executed by general-purpose computers, although these may be more challenging to audit.”File hosting service Ziddu has integrated a bitcoin wallet into its platform.

CCEDK CEO, Ronny Boesing:“It is an innovative and revolutionary game-changer to the world of crypto currency.”The government of Honduras will partner with Houston-based Bitcoin 2.0 startups Factom and Epigraph to build a land registry database for the Central American nation using the Bitcoin blockchain. Factom president Peter Kirby emphasized the need for a secure method of registering land in a country such as Honduras. Kirby told Rueters:""In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud.

First Cracks Appear in Central Banking Gone Wild (Op-Ed),George Samman,5/15/2015 13:45,267,0,"Central bank policy and regulations have made the markets illiquid. This combined with herd-mentality trading will have a negative impact on the economy when markets start re-pricing assets based on different valuation scenarios, which can happen unexpectedly and very quickly. Thus, the inevitable asset price correction and adjustment to new levels will be very painful in the near future.The global markets have a liquidity problem. This is evident from the rapid swings in equities, commodities (oil in particular), FX and most notably the bond markets. There have been notable “air pockets” in price, as labeled by traders. These are areas where slippage occurs. Slippage can be defined as the expected price of a trade and the price the trade actually occurs at. It usually happens in highly volatile or illiquid markets.At a time where global central banks have been easing for years and have pinned interest rates at near zero or even negative as well as engaged in unprecedented Quantitative Easing (QE) programs, this should not be happening.Chief Executive of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Tim Adams, recently stated that liquidity has been determined as the top issue in the meetings he’s had with central bankers, CEOs, and financial institutions.In a recent memo, famed hedge fund manager Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital succinctly addressed misconceptions about liquidity and what the important definition of liquidity is.“But the more important definition of liquidity is this one from Investopedia: ‘the degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset’s price,’” said Marks. He added:“Thus the key criterion isn’t ‘can you sell it?’ It’s ‘can you sell it at a price equal or close to the last price?’  […] For them to be truly liquid in this latter sense, one has to be able to move them promptly and without the imposition of a material discount.”The chart below shows what happens in a market that has high money liquidity propagated by central bank policies accompanied with low trading liquidity. Events of +/- 4 standard deviations at one time were extremely rare, but since the end of the global financial crisis and the beginning of central bank intervention, a different picture has emerged amongst all asset classes.The main reason cited for the liquidity problem is very harsh regulations that have been imposed, which have made it almost impossible for traditional and investment banking to play its classic market-making role. The market maker’s exact role is to provide liquidity to markets particularly in times when no one else will.In light of the regulations, those who once filled this role are holding way less inventory than they used to. Chief Economic Advisor, Mohamed El Erian, states:“Tighter regulations and less patient shareholders have restricted the ability of broker-dealers to deploy their balance sheets counter-cyclically. As such, they have limited appetite when it comes to accumulating inventory in the event that a large chunk of the investor base decides to go the other way. The result has been a series of sudden out-sized price moves in quite a range of markets, from sovereign bonds to foreign exchange, emerging markets, and high-yield corporates. Fortunately, due to the stance of central banks, most of these episodes have proven -- at least so far -- to be short in duration, temporary and reversible.”Another reason which has particular significance to the bond market is that in the 8 years corporate bond inventories in the US have dropped by 75% and by 50% in Europe. At the same time, due to the regulations which have been passed, banks are required to hold more bonds on their balance sheets.The QE by central banks has caused these entities to hold bonds of all timeframes. This has taken a tremendous amount of supply out of the market. The result of this is shown in the chart below when the market moves in one direction without liquidity.This is a massive move in a very short time.  What this shows is a negative feedback loop, meaning that if traders are positioning themselves for a lack of liquidity, this can further reinforce that lack of liquidity as traders and investors shrink their position sizes and become more cautious and unwilling to take on more risk. In fact, they are likely to hold for shorter time periods and have a quick trigger finger to exit positions due to these so-called “air pockets.”Liquidity paradox is a term coined by Citibank analyst Matt King to explain Central Bank policies of QE and extreme easing, which has herded investors into risky assets to get returns at a better rate than near 0%. According to Citi, this has caused “large scale mismatches in the number of buyers and sellers.” This has resulted in this liquidity paradox:“[…] because the more liquidity central banks add, the higher the risk of a serious liquidity crunch -  started out in corporate bond markets but is now distorting government bond, currency and share markets. It says while the post-financial crisis crackdown on own-account trading by investment houses was partly to blame for a decline in professional market-making, the increased difficulty of finding buyers because everyone is selling at once owes more to central banks' hold on financial markets since the crisis.”These policies have led to distortions in the capital markets and most people investing in the same way (herd-like investing), which has exacerbated the liquidity problem. Unwinding these trades is going to be problematic due to the massive one-sided trading.""The crisis takes a longer time coming than you think, and then it happens faster than you thought it would.""- Dornbusch’s LawIn other words, Dornbusch’s Law states that financial crises take a lot longer to arrive than one would think and then pass much faster than expected. So you have a chance to be wrong twice.While everyone thought the collapse of global economies would bring on the next crisis, what if the boom-bust cycle isn't what's going to cause the next crisis, but recognition that 2009 is behind us and zero interest rates awash with money liquidity are distorting asset class prices?A great re-pricing in interest rates (higher) in an illiquid market could send shockwaves to all asset classes.If this recovery happens faster and the central banks do what they do best - which is being reactive rather than proactive - interest rates will spike and choke off a nascent recovery roiling the markets because everyone is wrong-footed. Thus, people might actually have to invest again and not wait for “the Fed Minutes.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Central Bank    #Quantitative Easing  
Patchwork Regulation Could Mean EU Steals Show From ItBit And US,Charlie Richards,5/11/2015 14:35,921,0,"ItBit becomes the first US regulated exchange, but the EU might be about to harmonize digital currency law for 500 million people.On Thursday, May 7, Ben Lawsky tweeted out the now signed charter for ItBit, confirming its status as a registered trust business. This move allows ItBit to operate an online currency exchange between USD or other fiat currencies, and something like Bitcoin.Big day. New York issues first charter to a virtual currency company: @itBit (a Bitcoin Exchange) pic.twitter.com/CXrYTrtpGkAddressing the move in a press release on Thursday, Lawsky explained how he saw the chartering of ItBit as an important step in legitimizing and harnessing the potential of digital currencies for investors and entrepreneurs.“We have sought to move quickly but carefully to put in place rules of the road to protect consumers and provide greater regulatory certainty for virtual currency entrepreneurs. The technology behind Bitcoin and other virtual currencies could ultimately hold real promise and it is critical that we set up appropriate rules of the road to help safeguard customer funds. Indeed, we believe that regulation will ultimately be important to the long-term health and development of the virtual currency industry.”The problem facing ItBit, however, is that despite obtaining this license, the company still might not be able to legally operate in all 50 states. Looking into the situation, Wired asked regulators in California whether the NY approval would also work for the West Coast.“Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for the California Department of Business Oversight, says the agency has been “looking into” whether itBit’s charter would allow it to operate within the state. “We’re not prepared to agree that ItBit is can conduct exchange transactions with Californians under its New York certificate,” he says.”The differences in regulation between the US states have made a patchwork-quilt of how digital currencies are being looked at. While states like New Hampshire are looking at accepting BTC for tax payments, at the other extreme we reported earlier this week on comments from the national FinCEN (United States' Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ) that it was investigating a number of digital currency companies to assess whether they were complying with existing national financial regulations.Many fear that the lack of harmony around this regulation might drive innovative fin-tech companies away from opening, or even operating, in the US. Commenting on the regulatory situation emerging in America, Coinapult co-founder Erik Voorhees spoke to the Let's Talk Bitcoins podcast on May 6:“We didn't want to apply the tyranny of the US to the entire world of people we were trying to build services for. We didn't want to have to apply ridiculous rules that the US politicians create to the rural farmer in Africa.”This lack of cohesive approach could also be where the European Union is about to take a strong lead over the US. In an application to the European Court of Justice, the Swedish tax authorities have asked for a Europe-wide ruling on the nature of how digital currencies should be taxed, and therefore also regulated.Harmonizing the tax status of Bitcoin for 500 million customers could turn established tech hubs such as London, Berlin, and Tallinn, into global centers for the development of new financial technologies. The UK in particular has already taken steps along this road, having promised UK£10 million (US$15.5 million) for digital currency research in the country.If the US reaches a point at which a fin-tech company cannot operate in every state without meeting a different set of legislative requirements in each location, the option of a harmonized European market may tempt the money, companies, and development talent across the ocean.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ItBit    #Benjamin Lawsky    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #New York    #California  
FinCEN Examinations of Digital Currency Businesses ‘Will Drive Innovation Overseas',Charlie Richards,5/7/2015 15:45,276,0,"The United States' Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has announced it is working to investigate a string of digital currency businesses, assessing whether they meet financial regulations for the sector.Announcing the bureau's latest activity was director Jennifer Calvery, speaking at the West Coast AML (Anti Money Laundering) Forum in San Francisco May 6. The three-day event is a chance for federal and state regulators to meet with the government's investigative agencies and other qualified consultants.In her opening speech to the forum Calvery gave top billing to her department’s efforts to investigate potential regulatory violations in the virtual currency sector.“Working closely with our delegated BSA examiners at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), FinCEN recently launched a series of supervisory examinations of businesses in the virtual currency industry. […] Where we identify problems, we will use our supervisory and enforcement authorities to appropriately penalize non-compliance and drive compliance improvements.”The news comes shortly after Ripple was fined by FinCEN for not having registered its service as a money services business with regulators, and for also not following correct AML and know-your-customer (KYC) rules designed to prevent illegal financial uses of the platform. In her speech Calvery explained the bureau's move further:“Under the terms of the agreement, Ripple and its subsidiary, XRP II, consented to FinCEN’s $700,000 penalty, with credit for $450,000 in criminal forfeiture to be paid to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. They also admitted to FinCEN’s detailed statement of facts and admitted that their conduct constituted willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.”Previous punishments for those failing to comply with established financial services regulations have included jail time for the likes of ex-BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem. Sentenced to two years in federal prison for operating an un-licensed money transmission service that sent funds to the Silk Road marketplace, the businessman faces a lengthy stretch behind bars.In her speech, Calvery took pains to note the fact that these regulations are not new, and highlighted the bureau's previous efforts to advertise its existence when “FinCEN issued guidance just over two years ago, noting that virtual currency exchangers and administrators are “money transmitters” under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations”.Although financial services companies have always had an obligation to follow these national-level regulations, newer regional rules may also soon be coming into force. The final wording of New York's controversial BitLicense scheme is expected to be published in the coming weeks, meaning that digital currency startups in New York may soon face an additional layer of regulations, on top of the national set, to comply with.David Mondrus, CEO at the Blockchain Factory, spoke to Cointelegraph today about the statement, and voiced fears that increasing regulations in the US would push startups to move to jurisdictions with more relaxed legislation:""All this will do is drive innovation overseas. We already hear of companies registering in HK and avoiding US shores. This will only accelerate that trend""One example that supports Mondrus' view is the case of Coinapult which moved from the US to Panama to become a registered company in 2014. Explaining his motivations for the move, Co-Founder Erik Voorhees talked to the Let's Talk Bitcoins podcast on May 6.“[The government] think that their fiat currencies will outlive Bitcoin, but they're wrong. Once they realize that they're going to become very hostile, and we basically didn't want to build a bitcoin company in the US because of that.”“We didn't want to apply the tyranny of the US to the entire world of people we were trying to build services for. We didn't want to have to apply ridiculous rules that the US politicians create to the rural farmer in Africa.”Elsewhere in the US however, other fintech companies are showing that the sector is able to meet these financial services regulations and still thrive. The recent move by ItBit to become the first regulated Bitcoin bank in the US shows that regulations can work whilst still allowing for innovative financial products to develop, albeit within the constraints of the existing financial sector.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Blockchain News    #FinCEN    #AML    #KYC    #Politics    #US Government    #Ripple    #Coinapult

The event will be hosted by Blockchain Technologies Corp, a startup incubator associated with Bitcoin Center NYC, on April 19 at the private venue Union League Club.According to the deputy superintendent for public affairs of the New York Department of Financial Services, Matt Anderson, the final BitLicense proposal should be published “very soon”.Anderson:”We take some time to review the comments for potential changes or modifications, and hopefully will publish a final rule soon.”Coinbase gave some positive comments on the legal framework designed by North Carolina. The bitcoin wallet provider and exchange acknowledged North Carolina for improving a done-to-death Money Transmission Act that, in its latest form, would promote innovation and regulatory efficiency.Coinbase:“Reasonable states can disagree on whether regulation of certain virtual currency businesses is necessary in the first place, and if it is necessary, how to implement that regulation and with respect to whom. But to the extent states view money transmission regulation (or similar substitutes) as the right avenue for regulation, here’s why North Carolina’s approach is a good one.”Amid a challenging regulatory environment, Australia’s biggest telecoms operator Telstra indicated it is considering Bitcoin as a future payment method. Head of the company’s digital operations Monty Hamilton said he is keen to keep in touch with consumer trends with the company having integrated PayPal for payment in 2013.Hamilton:“If we see demand from customers these are things we will actively consider […]. The scale of our customer base is representative of society - we see trends so much earlier.”Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group rebranded the broker-dealer division of SecondMarket as Genesis Trading. Genesis Trading focuses solely on buying, selling and holding bitcoin and some other digital currencies for institutional clients such as hedge funds and alternative asset investors.Genesis Trading CEO Brendan O' Connor said:""Our goal is to become the partner of choice for large institutional buyers and sellers who are beginning to recognize the economic potential of digital currency.”Africa has achieved yet another milestone in the world of cryptocurrency as the first quarter of 2015 drew to a close. The continent saw the highest amount of venture capital backing so far according to the State of Bitcoin report, which covered the trends of cryptocurrency in the period; though it should be noted that Bitpesa, headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, was the only African cryptocurrency startup to make it into the VC investment section of the report.The first Bitcoin Consumer Fair comes to the Loudermilk Conference Center in Atlanta today and tomorrow. The educational and trade event addresses consumers and merchants who are interested in expanding the use of bitcoin in the Atlanta area, as well as those interested in working on the business and technology side of Bitcoin.According to co-organizer Jason Cronk:“Our goal is to reach a new audience for bitcoin […].

The most interesting of these is arguably the multisig setting, as BlockTrail itself only has access to one of the required seeds for each wallet, meaning the company can never run off with any funds, while users can retrieve bitcoins even if BlockTrail would – for whatever reason – vanish.Did you enjoy this article?

Bruce Fenton Thinks the Bitcoin Foundation Can Survive,Cyril Gilson,4/14/2015 14:56,550,0,"As the Bitcoin Foundation clearly needs change, its newly-elected executive director Bruce Fenton told Cointelegraph about his vision of most urgent issues that face the organization, including the lack of transparency, the image problem and the need to decentralize.“[N]ow we have a very different foundation than we had when it started – it has fully 100% elected board and a new executive director[.]”Cointelegraph: It's no secret the Foundation has an image problem both in the community and in the media. Are you worried about being its figurehead at this time?Bruce Fenton: Well I think we have a fast growing space that is bound to have a lot of changes and a lot of turmoil, and I think it’s a part of the challenges that the Foundation has had in the past as a result of that.But now we have a very different foundation than we had when it started – it has fully 100% elected board and a new executive director, and hopefully we can adapt, and overcome all these challenges, and become as effective as possible, to help Bitcoin ecosystem going forward. “In some areas the Foundation can and should be more transparent.”CT: Lack of transparency is one of the largest issues facing the foundation. How do you plan to address this?BF: It matters a lot. I think it’s important clearly to a lot of people. I would really solicit people who are concerned to very concrete requests and questions that they have. In some areas the Foundation can and should be more transparent. In other areas we sacrifice the potential for privacy so there are some things that shouldn’t be there. Either way, we should be having that discussion within the community with all of the members and everybody else who is concerned.  “One of the things we can do is to focus on crowdfunding that enable the members of all interested parties fund or participate in individual projects that they have a specific interest in.“CT: Do you plan to decentralize control? Some would argue that we don’t need a central authority for Bitcoin at all.BF: Yea, it’s not needed. I think just because it’s not needed doesn’t mean it can’t be useful and helpful to all in Bitcoin ecosystem. We have a lot of organizations in our world, such as media and different groups, academic groups and so on who are used to interacting with centralized organizations so we can serve a value to those organizations interacting in a way that they are familiar with.But I would like to decentralize the foundation more. One of the things we can do is to focus on crowdfunding that unable the members of all interested parties fund or participate in individual projects that they have a specific interest in. CT: Do you intend to consolidate on Jon Mathonis' leadership style or take the Foundation in a different direction? What are your plans?BF: First of all, I’d like to communicate with individual members, corporate members and the board and other stakeholders and really get a lot of feedback and see what are the best ideas for the way to make the foundation as beneficial as possible to Bitcoin.So my role I viewed it as taking the feedback and doing my best I can to implement it on a day-to-day basis. So part of the first job that I have is reaching out and getting feedback and getting ideas and listening to suggestions that people have on the way to making the Foundation most effective. “There’s a huge potential for crowdfunding and I think that the Foundation could serve as a semi-centralized organization in helping to shepherd some of these projects.”CT: What are the biggest unmet needs/unheard cries of the community?BF: I think that there’s a huge potential for crowdfunding and I think that the Foundation could serve as a semi-centralized organization in helping to shepherd some of these projects and work with some of the existing crowdfunding platforms out there to help identify opportunities for Bitcoin - ranging from education to advocacy to other areas and work as a focal point where people and organizations can participate as they see fit in areas that they see most interesting for their own goals and interests.“[W]e should work as hard as possible to avoid regulation in this space.”CT: What should the Foundation champion in terms of cryptocurrency regulation? For example if we take EU-wide or US-wide directives? As President of the Bitcoin Association, do you plan to develop entirely separate strategies for different jurisdictions? Is there room for overlap?BF: My personal believe is that we should work as hard as possible to avoid regulation in this space. I think it’s very early and I would do everything that I can to communicate with the regulators and explain to them the benefits of letting this space have some breathing room to try to create jobs and do the other things that are good for the economy and good for the world without regulation.  CT: Has your attitude towards the BitLicense changed?BF: I’ve been a very vocal critic of BitLicence ever since before it came about, and it turned out to be worse than many of us thought it would be in many ways. I think BitLicence is going to harm jobs and harm the economy of New York and I already see evidence that many of the movers in our space are either avoiding New York or pro-actively seeking a more business-friendly environment elsewhere and I don’t think that that fits into goals of most New Yorkers. So I would like to do everything that I can to try to avoid those regulations.   “A couple of decades back when the Internet was in its early days I attended to many very similar meetings to what I attend there now with the Bitcoin meetings.”CT: Have you spoken to Mr. Ito at MIT about his offer to create a technical standards committee?BF: No, I haven’t spoken to him.CT: But do you plan to engage him in some way?BF: Sure, I’d love to. My home is in Massachusets and I’m a big fan of MIT and have been attending meetings and conferences. A couple of decades back when the Internet was in its early days I attended to many very similar meetings to what I attend there now with the Bitcoin meetings. So yes, by all means MIT is a great place, and would be a great place to help Bitcoin, and I’ll always be interested in what’s going on there.  CT: How important for Bitcoin is the Rand Paul support. How do you think Rand Paul accepting BTC for his campaign would influence the price and consumer opinion of both Rand Paul and Bitcoin?BF: I think it’s a great thing. Remember, it was only a very recent time ago that it was a big question about whether bitcoin was even legal to use, and I think that a major frontrunner presidential candidate publicly and openly accepting bitcoin really does a lot for that kind of publicity.“[M]any people in Bitcoin are probably more likely to lean towards support a candidate like Rand Paul than perhaps other candidates in general.”Now there’s no doubt that it is legal and he’s following the law and doing so-an-so. It’s one of the positive benefits. Another benefit is that by doing so he’s promoting Bitcoin and I also think it’s a nice thing politically because many people in Bitcoin are probably more likely to lean towards support a candidate like Rand Paul than perhaps other candidates in general.  Did you enjoy this article?

Cryptocurrency Regulation in the International Community 2015: Part 2,William Suberg,4/12/2015 10:33,563,0,"Cointelegraph has assembled a research report on the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency across the globe. Already in 2015, we have seen many attempts at regulating new forms of digital currencies by various governments and jurisdictions, and we’d like to highlight the general trends and outlook for the readers.Below is the second half of the report that focuses on business compliance, consumer protection and the general trends for the future.A lot has been said regarding regulation of money service businesses (MSBs) across international jurisdictions. While often seen as a threat by cryptocurrency community, a substantial part of any legislation is nonetheless involved in security, particularly that of the consumer.The adopted measures, which involve MSBs and therefore could implicate cryptocurrency, generally target areas such as fraud protection (from rogue companies and organizations), and prevention of criminal activity such as terrorism and money laundering from being financed. These broad practices are adhered to throughout major markets. As we’ve seen, however, the ways in which they affect cryptocurrency industry do vary between states.Companies operating in major markets such as exchanges and trading outfits as of 2015 strictly adhere to best practice measures. These either allow them to operate legally within their chosen jurisdictions, or act as ‘future-proofing,’ which will allow them to operate with cryptocurrency in the future if they do not already do so.In the US, the steps described below have become mandatory for new and existing businesses with regard to regulatory compliance.Despite divergences, it must be remembered that cryptocurrency-based operators impose new challenges for policy makers, and that teething problems (such as those witnessed through the creation of New York’s BitLicense scheme, for example) are to be seen as a natural stage on the path to suitable regulatory environment.BitLicense is notable in being an advanced ‘test case’ for how regulation of cryptocurrency could progress globally. While having a set of rules focused on one small jurisdiction is disadvantageous, the highs and lows of the development period have provided useful insights to be taken on board by other authorities looking to deal with the issues surrounding lawful business use of cryptocurrency.BitLicense was created by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and was a major effort of its Chief Superintendent, Benjamin Lawsky. From its inception in late 2013, Lawsky has been the main proponent of the scheme, and accompanied many of its major milestones. Public reaction, particularly from within the cryptocurrency industry, has been notorious, and Lawsky has had to adapt the proposals considerably since the first draft was made available in August 2014.Below is a timeline of the main events surrounding BitLicense.When considering the issue of consumer protection, what is immediately conspicuous is that the nascent state of the cryptocurrency industry means that it still differs considerably from traditional finance in this respect. Whereas strict rules have governed businesses in the latter sector for decades, cryptocurrency remains an area where there is a major impetus to engage in consumer protection compliance, but little enforcement of it. This results in an uneven environment full of risk to consumers. However, as technology improves and best practice procedures gain popularity, the landscape is quickly changing.A current standard (as of March 2015) for cryptocurrency businesses is the use of multisignature technology as a way to secure funds and user information. This has been shown to greatly decrease the ease with which assets can be compromised by third parties (and, indeed, internally), but more recently it has been proven not to be entirely effective.By contrast, other industry operators are proponents of alternative methods such as cold storage, but this comes with its own risks and necessitates placing additional trust on those in charge of assets.As with any area of cryptocurrency, the current climate dictates that regulators attempt to strike a workable balance between suitable protection, which is in line with accepted standards, while allowing room for innovation and experimentation on the part of the cryptocurrency industry.Similarly, in this area as in others, governments are taking various stances, with some seemingly open to the above approach, and others either presenting extensive, possibly premature guidelines (e.g. New York State) or banning development altogether.In addition to the attitudes of regulators themselves, it is interesting to consider the consumers’ perspective when gauging an overall impression of public opinion in a certain jurisdiction.The above infographics display the results of a survey by CoinDesk of consumer attitudes towards regulation in selected major markets.While the international community is currently in a state of flux regarding cryptocurrency regulation, it is a widely held belief – even a foregone conclusion in 2015 – that regulation is a certainty in the future. It is this belief which has resulted in the many calls for a balanced solution from senior figures within the cryptocurrency sphere.As has been seen with the BitLicense proposals as a test case for the regulatory process, the need for transparency and ample public consultation is particularly conspicuous. While such an approach can lead to protracted drafting periods and a raft of differing perspectives, as well as feedback which is not always constructive, it is the principal method by which cryptocurrency can make legitimate inroads into mainstream consumer society.For the moment, however, the rate at which this could occur, as well as the regulators’ role in assisting this, remains inconsistent across the globe. While cryptocurrency is making progress in many countries, it is notable that in those with no formal legislation its practical application is being quickly realized, examples of this being Kenya and Botswana. It is thus notable that cryptocurrency development is currently occurring in two spheres: one with regulation, the other without it. In each case, different sections of society are benefitting from the effects of this new technology.Sources: Cointelegraph, Blockchain.info, CoinDesk, European Digital Currency and Blockchain Forum, CoinOutlet, Coinmap.org, CoinATMRadar, Bitcoinpulse.

Cryptocurrency Regulation in the International Community 2015: Part 1,William Suberg,4/11/2015 14:39,734,0," Cointelegraph has assembled a research report on the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency across the globe. Already in 2015, we have seen many attempts at regulating new forms of digital currencies by various governments and jurisdictions, and we’d like to highlight the general trends and outlook for the readers.The report will be published in two parts, with the first available below relating to the history and the current regulatory status around the world for 2015.Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have experienced a rapid evolution of public image over the past three years. From occupying an obscure niche in technology-oriented circles to becoming a major feature of global financial debate, their rise has in many ways been unprecedented.This rapid transformation has resulted in, and in turn been precipitated by, an explosion in associated socioeconomic activity. Businesses with countless focuses have appeared in order to profit from and innovative on the potential held by Bitcoin and its associated blockchain technology.  In fact, an entire ecosystem has taken root, which can be found in the majority of the world’s jurisdictions that has collectively come to be known as the cryptocurrency community.The practical implementation of cryptocurrency to the point where a certain number of members of this community, as well as lay consumers are using it to transact, has placed it firmly on the radar of international lawmakers. While this in itself is hardly a surprising development, the methods in which jurisdictions are treating cryptocurrency, as well as their overall perspective and degree of permissiveness, vary considerably. In many countries, there are still no clear rules dealing with cryptocurrency at all.This variability is not simply a reflection of the political situation in respective states; rather, it is seen as a consequence of the challenging nature of cryptocurrency itself. Blockchain technology and the many ways in which it manifests itself in practice create a complex new area for legislators, and the difficulty of regulating cryptocurrency is conspicuous in the fact that, for example, no jurisdiction has so far managed to produce an entirely effective solution.The challenges presented by cryptocurrency have furthermore been linked by skeptics, sometimes arguably excessively, to illicit activity. A popular belief in March 2015 is that cryptocurrency more easily facilitates achieving of illicit goals by criminals and other bad actors, and even that cryptocurrency by its very nature is somehow bound to heighten criminal activity. While it cannot be said that this is a definitive factor in deciding how policy makers legislate, it is certainly a common argument put forward in government literature on cryptocurrency, as any scan of news resources will confirm.It is safe to suggest that in considering the concept of effective regulation of cryptocurrency, lawmakers must take into consideration a wealth of factors concerning both consumers and businesses.The report below considers a number of these factors and provides some background information for perspective on the issue, as well as more in-depth opinion from a range of experts in the field. Long-time Cointelegraph collaborator Tone Vays also offers his contribution on several important topics, which can be found in the respective sections.The infographic below gives a brief outline of the major events to have occurred within the sphere of cryptocurrency regulation internationally, from the first noteworthy incident in Germany in August 2013 to Russia’s announcement of penalties for the use of ‘money surrogates’ in October 2014.The main objective seemingly desired by both regulators and the cryptocurrency community with regard to regulation is to strike an effective balance. This ‘balance’ more specifically consists of allowing for essential mechanisms related to areas such as tax and consumer protection to be applied to cryptocurrencies, while at the same time allowing for innovation within the community to continue unimpeded.As of March 2015, it is immediately apparent from consulting any relevant analytical material that this balance has not been achieved in any major jurisdiction, and far less so internationally. The infographic below gives an outline of current regulatory practices across the world.For more detailed information on specific areas, refer to the expert comments included following the infographic. Included are statements relating to positive, negative and contested jurisdictions to give an overall impression of the challenges facing cryptocurrency in each scenario.Sources: Cointelegraph, Blockchain.info, CoinDesk, European Digital Currency and Blockchain Forum, CoinOutlet, Coinmap.org, CoinATMRadar, Bitcoinpulse.

JP Morgan CEO: We Will Compete with Bitcoin Startups ‘Partnering Where It Makes Sense’,Diana Ngo,4/10/2015 11:28,385,0,"JP Morgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in America and one of the world's major provider of financial services, recently issued its 2014 annual report, in which the firm's chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon suggests that new competitors are ""looking to compete with banks,"" and that his firm is ""keeping an eye on [these emerging players],"" most particularly on Silicon Valley's startups.""Silicon Valley is coming,"" warns Dimon. ""There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking.""What the executive is referring to is nothing else but the financial-technology (fintech) startups that are looking to disrupt an industry that is ripe for innovation.According to a report from Accenture released in March, investment in fintech companies grew by 201% globally in 2014, with an estimate of US$12.2 billion injected into startups, highlighting investors’ interest in their disruptive potential.As of today, many young companies are looking to offer products and services that are traditionally provided by banks. Notably, JP Morgan seems to have set sight on the lending business, where startups like P2P lending platform LendingClub, or its equivalent in bitcoin BTCJam and BitLending Club, can provide loans to individuals and small businesses ""very quickly and – these entities believe – effectively by using Big Data to enhance credit underwriting.""Dimon explains:""They are very good at reducing the 'pain points' in that they can make loans in minutes, which might take banks weeks. We are going to work hard to make our services as seamless and competitive as theirs. And we also are completely comfortable with partnering where it makes sense.""Another key area for the bank that is described as ""a critical business,"" is the payments industry with current competitors like ""Bitcoin, merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal look-alikes,"" the company further said.""Payments are a critical business for us – and we are quite good at it. But there is much for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques, and reduction of costs and 'pain points' for customers.""While Dimon notes that ""new competitors always will be emerging,"" he believes that it is ""even truer today because of new technologies and large changes in regulations,"" and fears ""the potential effects of an uneven playing field.""""The combination of these factors will have a lot of people looking to compete with banks because they have fewer capital and regulatory constraints and fewer legacy systems.""Overall, JP Morgan had a pretty good year, with a record of US$21.8 billion in net income on revenue of US$97.9 billion.But despite promising financial results and many successes, the firm claims that ""legal and regulatory costs and future uncertainty regarding legal and regulatory costs,"" might have harmed the company's stock performance during the past five years.Dimon stated:""While the business franchise has become stronger, I believe that legal and regulatory costs and future uncertainty regarding legal and regulatory costs have hurt our company and the value of our stock and have led to a price/earnings ratio lower than some of our competitors.""According to the annual report, JP Morgan might face up to US$5.8 billion in losses related to ongoing legal proceedings, that include private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations.JP Morgan is widely known for its antagonist moves towards digital currencies. In October 2014, Dimon publicly said that he considered Bitcoin as a competitor, emphasizing that he was ready to compete.In 2013, the bank patented a digital payment system in bid to rival Bitcoin. As of December 2013, the firm was reported to have issued a total of 175 unsuccessful claims that were either cancelled or rejected by the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). Did you enjoy this article?

MAR 27 DIGEST: Council on Foreign Relations Calls Bitcoin ‘Nuts’; PayPal fined $7.7 Million,Charlie Richards,3/27/2015 12:45,263,0,"Council on Foreign Relations describes Bitcoin as ‘the craziest thing since the 1630s’; PayPal fined US$7.7 million for allowing transactions to countries covered by the United States' sanctions policy and more top stories for March 27.Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations took to Bloomberg to describe Bitcoin as “nuts” and the “craziest thing since the 1630s.” Wrongly suggesting that there is an unlimited supply of Bitcoin, the financial historian goes on to support the idea of digital currency as a payment system, and attacks the concept of crowdfunding.“Bitcoin is nuts, it's the craziest thing I've seen since the 1630s which was the Dutch Tulip Mania when people would spend ten times their income on one tulip bulb. What is money? Money has always been a scarce metal like gold, where you can't inflate it away because there's a limited supply of it.”The US Treasury Department has taken aim at payments giant PayPal, imposing fines of US$7.7 million for allowing transactions, which violated America's sanctions policy. PayPal had voluntarily handed over evidence of cases where they had failed to screen payments that ended up in Iran, Cuba, and Sudan.“In total, according to the Treasury Department, nearly 500 PayPal transactions, worth almost $44,000, had potentially violated sanctions that ban US companies from doing business with individuals or organisations on a blacklist.”Following the recent news that the Bitcoin Investment Trust is now trading shares on the ticker GBTC, the parent entity Digital Currency Group has launched of Grayscale Investments, tasked with sponsoring the BIT fund. Seeking to become an authority figure within digital currency investments, the start-up will be running the BIT's day-to-day business, and running it as an investment product.""We're trying to establish ourselves as the trusted authority on digital currency investing, and seek to develop a fleet of investable products that will allow people to invest in digital currency.""Once hoped to become a haven of international digital currency companies, the Isle of Man off the coast of Britain has introduced new rules that will force cryptocurrency start-ups to comply with its anti-money laundering regulations. Coming into force on April 1, the rules will involve digital currency businesses complying with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements and reporting suspected laundering (AML).“[B]itcoin businesses will have to comply with the island's anti-money laundering laws. The new regulation stems from amendments made to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 in order to accommodate digital currencies like bitcoin.”Having already become one of the first Bitcoin companies to be pubic ally traded in the US, BitcoinShop has now taken an additional 2% stake in CoinOutlet in its mission to grow as a force in the digital currency world.“We believe ATMs are a great on-ramp and access points that will connect the digital currency ecosystem with the traditional Fiat systems. If we can successfully integrate our platform with Coin Outlet, we believe we'll be well positioned to offer a unique value add service to customers.”Aiming to reward customer loyalty, 7-11 Mexico has launched its own virtual currency dubbed “BigCoin” as a way of offering rewards and incentives. Redeemable only online for now, the chain of convenience stores aims to roll out its use to physical locations at a later date.“Customers will be rewarded with the virtual currency ‘simply by logging into [the company's] social blog,’ reading, sharing or commenting on 7-Eleven's products pages and such.”In an effort to unite the diverse world of 600+ cryptocurrencies behind a common banner, a group of designers has been working to develop a universal brand for cryptocurrency itself. The final design is set to be picked by public vote on the central BrandMeCrypto website.“I found myself and our designers struggling to visually articulate cryptocurrency as a whole without inundating our designs with 5+ more coins just to communicate the overarching cryptocurrency conversation and message.”Silicon Valley incubator Plug and Play is seeking to build a bridge between the world of Wall Street and digital currency start-ups through their latest intake round. Working with an emphasis on the FinTech sector, the class includes a number of cryptocurrency businesses who will be working with advisers from large investment groups and houses.“The latest accelerator program is focused on startups in financial technology, ‘fintech’ in the parlance, and includes a handful of Bitcoin startups like ChangeTip and 37Coins. They are working directly with mentors from financial firms like USAA, Citi Ventures, and Capital One, and the interest appears to be very much mutual. For both sides, it’s a chance to learn what the other has to offer.”Did you enjoy this article?

"Britain and the US Compete to Foster New Payment Systems, Bitcoin",William Suberg,3/26/2015 11:16,696,0,"New regulation to be enacted in the UK could see Bitcoin exchanges and related services enjoy access to faster payments and considerably increase liquidity as the United States is also considering similar incentives in an attempt to foster emerging payment systems. Legislation published by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) requires that “pan GB operators” who are not already subject to specific access requirements to have “objective, risk based and publicly disclosed Access Requirements, which permit fair and open access.”Access to payment systems has been an issue, which has long dogged Bitcoin operators in the UK, with skittish banking relationships and regulatory uncertainty causing many to move off-shore or secure off-shore banking support.Although it has been argued that the PSR announcement is an example of “regulation to fight regulation,” the cementing of obligations on the part of Bitcoin exchanges will no doubt be greeted by the industry. Coming off the back of last week’s landmark budget announcement, sentiment regarding the climate for Bitcoin in the UK is once again running high.The PSR report continues:“The Access Rule will help ensure that Access Requirements do not unnecessarily or disproportionately restrict direct participation in payment systems and do not act as a barrier to entry and expansion for new and emerging [payment systems providers].”Equally conspicuous is the reaction of the banking community, which in a report issued Wednesday by the British Bankers Association, voiced its apparent displeasure at the new environment for digital currencies:“Bitcoin users can handle many of their daily payments needs themselves, without the need for interaction with banks, and avoiding the need to incur bank fees. In the same way, value stored in PayPal accounts moves outside of the bank’s payment systems, depriving banks of valuable payments revenue […]. As digital and crypto-currencies gain traction, the threat to bank’s free-income streams will grow.”Operators set to abide by the legislation are required to submit a progress report to the PSR by the end of June 2015.Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has outlined legislation regarding how small businesses can raise and access capital, which is due to become law in two months’ time.As part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, rules for raising capital will be relaxed to allow small startups raising up to US$20 million within a 12-month period – including those in digital currency – easier market entry. There will also be a second tier pertaining to up to US$50 million, which will see companies subject to “subject to additional disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements,” the SEC stated in its press release about the changes.“These new rules provide an effective, workable path to raising capital that also provides strong investor protections,” SEC Chair Mary Jo White commented.  “It is important for the Commission to continue to look for ways that our rules can facilitate capital-raising by smaller companies.”Did you enjoy this article?

The Bitcoin Price Rollercoaster: North to South and Back,Charlie Richards,3/19/2015 14:08,644,0,"A week ago, many Bitcoin enthusiasts were watching and waiting for the cryptocurrency to once again cross the US$300 per BTC price point. 7 days later, and price is down to as low as US$250.The start of the year saw an even greater slump in prices that brought the cost of a bitcoin as low as US$177 in January. Since then the market price has been steadily rising, seemingly, on the back of a series of validating, and exciting success stories from the sector.The combination of these milestones in Bitcoin's development has been increasing interest, trust, and awareness of coin not only as a currency, but also as a technology applicable to industries as diverse as remittances, and notary services. When asking why we've seen the Bitcoin price head south so suddenly it is plain to see that this is a complicated question.Like any other currency, Bitcoin is going to experience the ups and downs of interacting and being influenced by external global factors, whether it's a strong dollar, or the nod of approval in a government budget. The fact we've seen volatility in the market in the last few weeks should reassure users that interest in Bitcoin is lively, and the market is becoming more intertwined with the external financial world.Here's what we've seen happen to Bitcoin in the last two months.Regulation by states and local governing bodies has previously caused great concern about the impact on digital currency start-ups. New York's BitLicense was perhaps the most public of these, drawing the attention of much of the Bitcoin community against regulations that many believed would stifle innovation in the sector.The companies that are gaining the necessary approval to operate within these regulations however are demonstrating that cryptocurrencies are growing up, and are becoming able to distance themselves from the “wild-west” reputation of the past.On Wednesday, the UK government issued a favorable report on the digital currency sector as part of the national spring budget. Not only did the Treasury pledge US$14.6 million in research funding, but also announced the application of anti-money laundering regulations to the sector. In doing so, it took an conspicuous step towards the UK becoming a global Bitcoin hub.  In North America we've seen QuadrigaCX recently become the world's first publicly traded Bitcoin exchange when it received the approval of the Canadian regulators. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Bitcoin Investment Trust beat the Winklevoss Twins in the race to become the first publicly traded Bitcoin Fund.Following the US$315 million raised last year, 2015 began with high estimations of the level of venture capital we would see flowing into the crypto space within the year. The news of Coinbase's previously record breaking US$75 million series C funding round almost immediately in January seemed to confirm this.The news that previously stealth-mode digital currency start-up 21 inc. has raised US$115 million in venture funding continued the VC trend. These massive investments into start-ups working on digital currency projects has reinvigorated the belief that the technology is now firmly on the path of mass investment.Digital currencies like Bitcoin have had a core of supporters for years now, celebrating the benefits and opportunities the technologies represent. What we've seen happening in the last few weeks is a surprising set of international players showing their appreciation and interest in the crypto space.Utah has now made the news as a bill passed through its Senate chamber causing the state to begin looking into the practicalities of accepting Bitcoin payments for state services. Proposed by Utah House of Representatives member Marc K. Roberts, and already approved by the Senate's Revenue and Taxation Committee, the bill explores the way in Bitcoin could save the state payment processing fees.Alongside these positive good-news stories however, the cryptocurrency world has had its share of less fortunate developments this year too. The price drop from the near US$300 mark last week seems to speak to a loss of user confidence in the currency, and there are some good reasons why that could be.Not only has the Bitcoin suffered in its ratio to the dollar, so has almost every other fiat currency going. The strong dollar makes breaking the US$300 point harder, and also disincentives many US$ holdings users from investing in Bitcoin faced with a range of more stable yet currently cheap fiat currencies.The collapse of dark market exchange Evolution at the hands of a US$12 million exit scam by its founders is just the latest in a string of losses that have beset the digital currency world. In the same week, Coinapult admitted to have lost US$43,000 from one its hot wallets.One estimate now puts the average monthly thefts from Bitcoin at around 18,500 every month since 2011. The prospect of making a jump to wider user adoption looks remote when faced with this scale of regular and seemingly unstoppable losses.Presenting a double-edged sword to the digital currency community, regulations are not solely seen as a positive step towards legitimacy and transparency. The fear of over-regulation stifling the nascent world of crypto start-ups fueled much of the protest around New York's BitLicense proposals.Announcements, such as the UK government's plan to introduce anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer legislation for the cryptocurrency sector, spooks many smaller and anonymity driven users away from the currency.The factors outlined above suggest a longer-term growth in the perceived value of Bitcoin, or perhaps more specifically only the blockchain in some cases. Not purely as a speculative vehicle as we saw in 2012, but based on a deeper interest and understanding of the underlying technology itself.With the psychologically feel-good figure of US$300 so nearly reached, followed by the dramatically easier buy-in price, there may now be resurgence of interest from past investors in Bitcoin looking to get back into the cryptocurrency. These reappearing Bitcoin users could lead to a short-term price rise as they scramble to increase their Bitcoin holdings.Regardless of this short-term movement though, the longer term trajectory appears to be upwards as with no major dark clouds on the cryptocurrency's horizon, stories such as 21 Inc.'s mega investment, and BIT's Wall Street launch, will continue to raise interest and awareness among previously skeptical individuals and companies. Did you enjoy this article?

"California Considers US$5,000 BitLicense-style Scheme for “virtual currency”",Charlie Richards,3/16/2015 15:43,258,0,"The Californian state assembly is considering legislation that would require all “virtual currency” businesses to acquire a US$5,000 license to operate legally.Seeking to extend its existing legislation around businesses transmitting consumer money, the West Coast state is now looking to include “virtual currency” companies from the cryptocurrency sector in the regulations.Drawing strong comparisons to the BitLicense proposal currently working its way through the New York legal system, the proposed legislation in Bill AB-1326 describes its purpose as follows.“This bill would prohibit a person from engaging in this state in the business of virtual currency, as defined, in this state unless the person is licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or is exempt from the licensure requirement, as provided.”Alongside paying the Californian treasury US$5,000, applicants will need to provide extensive background information for both their business and themselves. If these credentials are accepted and their license granted, the successful business will then still face strict money control requirements such as the need for a cash reserve equal to 100% of funds deposited by customers for “transmission”.“[E]xisting law requires each licensee to deposit and maintain on deposit with the Treasurer cash in an amount not less than, or securities having a market value not less than, such amount as the commissioner may find and order from time to time as necessary to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to money transmission in this state.”If passed, the rules look set to vastly increase the difficulty start-ups face when entering the cryptocurrency sector. Designed to offer consumers financial protection when using conventional money transmission services, the regulation's scope covers nearly the entire of the cryptocurrency space.Similar in nature to New York's BitLicense, both bills appear to represent lawmakers struggling to get to grips with the nature of cryptocurrencies. In New York, the proposed regulations drew a strong reaction from tech companies, crypto enthusiasts, and the Bitcoin based start-up scene developing in the city.Cointelegraph spoke to Bitcoin expert Tone Vays about the news, and how he felt the cryptocurrency community should react.""The Bitcoin community should do what it should have done from the beginning; ignore regulation by building technological solutions that make the laws unenforceable. All regulation until the end of the decade will only be there for two reasons: to slow down the growth of new technology, and to allow the government to catch up in understanding and identify every wallet in order to maximize tax collection.""California made headlines at the beginning of the year when it moved to legalize accepting forms of currency other than the dollar within the state. At the time, this placed California as one of the most forward-thinking states on the issue of digital currencies, although since then we have seen bills in Utah, New Hampshire, and New York, examining whether the state itself could accept bitcoins for service payments.Back in California, the new bill has been introduced by assembly member Matt Dababneh, who also sits as the Chairman of the Banking and Finance Committee. Talking about his Chairman role on his website, Dababneh highlights increasing consumer protections as one of his aims, a challenge which the proposed Bitcoin bill would seem to fall in line with.“As Chairman he plans to focus on increasing access to capital in underserved communities, financial literacy in younger generations, increasing consumer protections and combating predatory lending.”The desire to increase financial literacy in younger generations however could be called dubious, as the US$5,000 cost of licensing a Bitcoin business in the state could now present an insurmountable barrier to entry for many young coders, and developers, building the new cryptocurrency financial world.Did you enjoy this article?

Tor Users Expotential Rise in UAE Suggests Increased Global Lack of Privacy,Iyke Aru,2/2/2017 14:15,602,203,"As the world population seeks personal freedom and protection of privacy, the desire for information security keeps increasing day by day. An example is the United Arab Emirates’ number of Tor users that went from about 10K to more than 250K in a matter of days, surpassing even Russia.Tor is an acronym for ""The Onion Router."" It's an open source software project originally developed by the US Naval Research Lab for the purpose of secure communication over the Internet intended for government agencies as well as dissidents fighting oppressive regimes.Ideally, you can access Internet services without anyone knowing that it was you who actually accessed them.Tor works by relaying your data through a series of different connections, known as nodes, all over the world in such a way that it becomes virtually impossible to track the data flow which creates space between you and your potential identifier.Bolaji Ogunsola, tech enthusiast and security expert,  describes Tor as an ‘almost safe’ tool. Ogunsola Says that although hackers also use Tor as a tool for anonymity, since the traffic is encrypted at every hop communications are usually secure until the exit node of Tor.Ogunsola describes the exit node as the point where the user’s traffic leaves the anonymous network and enters into the open Internet, from there traffic can be monitored. If anyone wants to sniff the traffic then they can sniff at the exit node.Ogunsola says to Cointelegraph:“You can see there is exit node/relay from where your traffic leaves TOR. From there onwards, the traffic can be sniffed. If you are browsing a site like Facebook then there is no harm because the traffic is encrypted. So when it will leave the TOR network then it will be encrypted as well.”Analyzing the Tor technology, Christopher Franko, CEO Borderless Corp, says that for an increasingly one-way transparent society who champions freedom like most people do, anonymity certainly has its benefits. In one way, because intelligence agencies have nearly limitless access to you and your private data but you don't really have any access to theirs and if anyone gains access they are severely punished.According to Franko, the rise in the number of Tor users is directly related to the unique combination of the limitless one-way access to private data and censorship-prone to oppressive regimes because people naturally want freedom. Franko explains that people want access to information, and they don't want to be punished for it and Tor gives them some of that freedom with peace of mind.Franko says:“The more people who use the technology, the more effective it is at masking the origin of the traffic. Which is one of the reasons the creators released it to the world.”However, Franko explains that because of the privacy characteristic of Tor, it has attracted both good and bad actors. Over the last few years, Tor has empowered activists and journalists, it has kept sensitive information safe and it allows regular people to escape the prying eyes of an advertiser’s tracking campaign. Yet it also gives place for evil.Franko concludes by noting that his personal perspective of Tor is that the pros outweigh the cons.“Apparently the NRL also felt that way or they wouldn't have developed and released it to the world.”",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Christopher Franko    #Tor    #Privacy    #UAE  
Bank Of England: ‘Tougher Regs’ For ‘World’s Leading Fintech Center’ London,William Suberg,1/27/2017 15:10,262,120,"UK fintech businesses should prepare for a more “intense regulatory focus” in the future, the Bank of England has said sharing its vision of post-Brexit London.The Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, also stated in a speech Wednesday that despite Brexit negotiations, London was to become the “world’s leading fintech center.”The somewhat contradictory remarks from Carney were made in his capacity as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a Swiss-based group which makes recommendations to G20 countries.He said that fintech companies en masse could potentially pose risks to traditional banking models, the Financial Times reports, and as a result, regulations would likely become more stringent in the next few years.“... Authorities can be expected to pursue a more intense focus on the regulatory perimeter, more dynamic settings of prudential requirements, a broader commitment to resolution regimes and a more disciplined management of operational and cyber risks,” he continued.On the topic of fintech businesses’ potential to disrupt banking and bring services to more sections of the population, Carney added that they could also “exacerbate financial volatility.”London is by no means a stranger to financial innovation and the Bank of England itself is fostering Blockchain innovation as well through both research and pilot projects.The UK currency issuer the Royal Mint even announced a partnership in November to facilitate Blockchain-based gold trading. Already a year in the making, the move is designed to make London a more attractive environment for investors to trade gold.“We didn’t set out with Blockchain in mind but we wanted to address the problem that it costs money to vault gold,” David Janczewski, director of new business at the Royal Mint, told the Telegraph newspaper. “This is a digital solution to physical gold trading.”The risks and uncertainty facing the British economy meanwhile have become notorious causes for volatility in the pound sterling since the Brexit vote was announced last June. 90 percent of banks said preparing for leaving the European Union was now their top priority.Bitcoin businesses have faced a mixed ride in recent times, with several reports over 2016 of banks unexpectedly cutting off services without warning only to reinstate them later. Local Bitcoins users have also complained of service denials, in particular from Barclays, which in October also blocked an account linked to UK news portal CoinJournal.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Banks    #FinTech    #London    #United Kingdom  
EU Imposes Banking Rules on Cryptocurrencies Without Granting Banking Rights: Expert,Frisco d'Anconia,1/21/2017 15:55,631,525,"The Bitcoin community has reacted to the European Union's announcement that digital currency control will be on its list of priorities in 2017.Matthias Klees, a founding member of LocalCrypto and the CEO of EuropeCoin, has called on the cryptocurrency community not to contribute to confusion caused by incorrect wording.Klees states:""The barrier to understanding cryptocurrency, for an average person, is high enough. Wrong wordings are preventing the public from understanding what is going on. The European Union is trying to regulate cryptocurrency businesses, not the currencies. We should not contribute to this kind of confusion because by doing so, we are starting to play their game of misinformation.""In a chat with the Cointelegraph, Klees, who was an advisor to Brussels’ top institutions, believes that in the first place, the authorities cannot control cryptocurrencies and other decentralized forms of money or consensus-seeking.He insists:“The rule is, if you are holding customer funds in any form, you are subject to regulation. Sounds fair in the first place but keep in mind they are trying to impose banking rules on us, without granting banking rights. This is far from fair.”The EU’s accusation that Bitcoin and other ?ryptocurrencies are channels for terrorism financing and money laundering is also unfounded and frivolous in the opinion of the crypto expert and investor.""How much money is involved in terrorism financing and money laundering? Even the market cap of Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies combined renders that claim ridiculous. Currencies involved in these actions, for the most part, are the US dollar and euro,"" he added.When it comes to financing and money laundering, Klees is of the view that the traditional banking cartels should not get away with it.The EU regulation attempt not only targets cryptocurrencies but also cash by lowering the maximum payment in cash to 7,500 euros. Now we can obtain an idea of what this regulation is about in the first place, he says, and adds:""It's not about cryptocurrency. It's about limiting any form of free person to person exchange and consensus seeking.""However, the digital currency expert disagrees that the EU authorities are concerned that they cannot tax digital assets. The contention emanates from the fact that Blockchain preserves data forever.Klees adds:""Cryptocurrency will not end the EU. The EU will end the EU if no real reform happens.""“EuropeCoin is run by a group of grassroots lobbyists, to promote decentralization of powers,” explains Klees. “We are actively getting in touch with merchants on the ground, like your next door grocery store. We are regionalists.""",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #EU    #Banks    #Cryptocurrencies    #Matthias Klees  
How the Chinese Government Influences Bitcoin - and Vice Versa,Iyke Aru,1/12/2017 12:35,560,384,"The sudden announcement of inspections of major Bitcoin operators by the Chinese Central Bank caused panic and a significant drop in Bitcoin price within just a day.In the past few days, Bitcoin has been shedding most of the gains of the end of 2016 and early 2017. These gains were attributed mostly to activities of Chinese traders who did huge volumes in the market, thereby singlehandedly increasing the global demand for Bitcoin.One characteristic that the users of Bitcoin have always boasted about is the fact that the government cannot control or determine what happens in the Bitcoin world.Considering the recent developments in China, one may wonder what aspect of the cryptocurrency is really beyond government influence.Aleksandar Matanovic of EC District tells Cointelegraph that Bitcoin itself cannot be controlled by governments. Matanovic explains that rather, it is companies working with Bitcoin that are usually affected by the activities of their governments of residence.According to Matanovic, since exchanges are the places where Bitcoins are traded and its price is being determined, every action or decision by the government that affects such exchanges usually affects the price of Bitcoin too:“Individuals can use Bitcoins freely among themselves and there is little governments can do about that. However, through regulations, they affect the usability of Bitcoin, which naturally affects its price.”Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing drives home his opinion by quoting the philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer who says that new technologies go through three phases: first, they are ridiculed, second, they are violently opposed and third, they are seen as self-evident.Epstein says that what we are seeing now in China is the second phase, which he describes as the struggle for ultimate “control” by the State. Epstein notes that Bitcoin represents a threat to the Yuan as a tool of control by the government. Therefore, they are violently opposing it using the force of the State.Epstein says:“It may be rough and ugly for a while, but ultimately, I think they will have to bend.”According to Epstein, it is an ironic twist that a decentralized technology that isn’t owned by anyone could be the single thing that forces China to change more than other countries’ foreign policy.",1,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #Government    #China  
Facebook’s E-Money Project Faces First Obstacles - Privacy and Security Issues,Joseph Young,12/31/2016 9:50,188,241,"Recently, Facebook revealed through its newsroom that global government requests in the first half of 2016 for personal user information increased by 27% globally, from 46,710 to 59,229 requests. The total government requests for Facebook user data are set to surpass 100,000 by the end of 2016. The sheer amount of data requests demanded by authorities suggests that Facebook’s money transmission or P2P networks are not optimal for user privacy and security.Facebook stated:“Government requests for account data increased by 27% globally compared to the last half of 2015, increasing from 46,710 to 59,229 requests. The majority of data requests we received were for law enforcement in the United States, approximately 56%, contained a non-disclosure order that prohibited us from notifying the user.”Earlier this year, Cointelegraph reported Facebook’s acquisition of an e-money license in Europe, which officially granted the social media giant permission to launch a money transmission business throughout the EU.Facebook already has a P2P payment network for the United States based consumers that allow users to send and receive payments with ease through the same messaging application embedded into the Web and mobile Facebook platforms. By connecting credit or debit cards or bank accounts, which allows users to send money simply from one account to another.A major issue arises when Facebook is requested to submit user data to law enforcement without notifying the user. Hundreds of thousands of users could have had their personal and financial data submitted to law enforcement in a compilation without their knowledge.Most personal information of a user is already listed on their public profile page. However, financial information of users is an extremely valuable and important set of data, which must be dealt with extreme caution and proper security protocols for obvious reasons.Financial information such as credit card details, expenditures and spending habits describe a person’s history, personality, characteristics and lifestyle in unprecedented details. Personal data such as emails, addresses and mobile phone numbers are limited to a certain range of information they can provide. On the other hand, financial data can become valuable to external users or third party, as they can be utilized to analyze and investigate a user.It is difficult for Facebook to track and to evaluate law enforcement or other agencies’ operations and utilization of financial information of its users. Thus, Facebook can not possibly guarantee legitimate usage of user information and is limited to the explanation provided by the agency or law enforcement it complied with.With an increasing number of cases reported throughout the past few years in regards to unlawful and inappropriate usage of information by law enforcement and police, users must be aware of their financial information and the fact that third party investigators could put surveillance on their data at all times.Such issues will continue to arise in financial networks that are reliant on a central authority to control the network.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Facebook    #Privacy    #Security  
"Thailand: Central Bank Asks All Banks To Avoid Crypto, Pending Regulations",Molly Jane Zuckerman,2/13/2018 11:12,25761,432,"Veerathai Santiprabhob, governor of the central Bank of Thailand, has asked all banks in Thailand to stay away from cryptocurrency, Reuters reported yesterday, Feb. 13.According to Reuters, the central bank released a circular Monday that bans banks in Thailand from investing and trading in crypto, as well as participating in and creating exchanges and platforms for crypto trading.The circular applies specifically to banks, not to exchanges or other services, which are still allowed to operate freely in the country.Banks were also asked not to advise customers on crypto investment or trading, and to ban clients from using credit cards for crypto purchases. Several large banks globally have already instituted a similar ban of credit card purchases of crypto last week, as the crypto markets took a dip to new multi-month record lows.In explaining their reasoning for the ban on banks’ dealing with crypto, The Bank of Thailand cited concerns over digital currencies being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering or terrorist activities, and noted that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in the country.Thai Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong had stated on Feb. 7 that the Thai government will not ban crypto trading, but will work on constructing a regulatory framework for digital currencies, the Bangkok Post reported. The Bank of Thailand’s circular can be seen as warning banks away from crypto until this regulatory framework can be implemented.In September, 2017, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Thailand) had also announced a willingness to support Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) by implementing regulations that would protect investors against fraud. Yesterday, Feb.12, SEC secretary-general Rapee Sucharitakul said the SEC does not have the ability to block crypto transactions as they are traded through online platforms, but will attempt to educate investors to protect them from ICO scams, the Bangkok Post reported.Thailand’s Ministry of Finance had said Feb. 2 that the Bank of Thailand and the SEC Thailand should warn customers about investing in crypto markets, but that Blockchain technology could be useful for Thailand’s financial sector.The central Bank of Thailand had previously held a meeting with Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin in August 2017 about the future possibility of integrating Ethereum into the Thai financial sector to improve the efficiency of already existing infrastructure.",2,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Thailand    #Cryptocurrencies    #Banks  
Does Bitcoin Need Government Support For It to Go Mainstream?,Joshua Althauser,6/17/2017 12:30,8180,472,"Cryptocurrencies, having already made a strong presence years back since its inception, have been making rounds in the news over the past few weeks.While online payment options such as PayPal and other online facilities have been the ones spearheading the payment transfer field, Bitcoin has also made its presence felt in the same field.Bitcoin has made use of peer-to-peer transaction technology, allowing individuals to transfer money online. Despite the innovation behind Blockchain technology, the problem still lies in the fact that regulations and laws within the field of Bitcoin are lacking and that there remain gray areas due to the inadequate legal framework.While many investors and businessmen are already looking towards the potential of Blockchain technology as a revolutionary one in the field of finance, it still needs support from the government in order to fully impact the world.In a report by Fortune, it was noted that government insight and regulation was needed on how to handle the licenses of Bitcoin companies as well as taxes. For example, Bitcoin companies that transfer Bitcoins on behalf of people require a money transmission license, however, companies which don’t transfer on behalf of users don’t require such licenses.While Bitcoin investors cannot avoid taxes when they invest in Bitcoin, there are no standard and fixed rules regarding the taxation of Bitcoins. In fact, the IRS has recently been under fire for wanting to collect the records of all users of Bitcoin exchange Coinbase for taxation investigation purposes.In a news report, Congress leaders were questioning the IRS as to what basis the IRS had for demanding the release of Coinbase user records. They claim that this action is highly intrusive and does not have solid basis due to the lack of solid regulations surrounding Bitcoin taxation.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Government    #Mainstream    #Cryptocurrencies    #Payments    #Transactions    #Law    #Investments    #IRS    #Coinbase

"IRS, Softly, Takes Step Back From Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Summons",Alexander Geralis,7/11/2017 17:50,18049,276,"The Internal Revenue Service made demands to Coinbase to turn over information on every single one of its US users in the May 17 letter.Senior Republicans were quick to point out that the IRS might very well be exceeding its authority.The “millions of pages” requested seem out of proportion considering that most users traded less than $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency in the requested period. Coinbase, which frequently denies access to users who fail KYC and AML standards, was quick to defend its customers.DOJ trial attorney Amy Matchison points out that the IRS has been in talks with Coinbase to narrow its request to only “unreported income” items. The audits will be limited, but not dropped completely.The “narrowed summons” released July 7 has made the following notable changes:Furthermore, the IRS is now seeking to probe users who own or trade $20,000.The fact that many traders in the cryptocurrency markets are not clear on how to file their earnings might be the root of the problem. Only 802 individuals filled the 8949 form and relating Bitcoin profits.Coinbase did recently provide some information that might be useful to users regarding their questions, bringing to light that it might be more of a question of how to correctly report your profits rather than avoiding them.Cryptocurrency profits and taxes vary from country to country and have to have been addressed efficiently. With the growth spurred in the past few years, this might be the next target to make adoption, use and regulation [on profits] easier.Amid the summons, with Berns Weiss defending users, Coinbase is still growing rapidly and seeking to raise substantial funding to feed the growth.In January CEO Brian Armstrong said the legal battle could cost his company up to $1 mln.Despite the recent slowdown in market growth – 2017 is still lining up to be one of the most bullish years cryptocurrencies have ever seen.",3,  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Coinbase    #Bitcoin Exchanges    #IRS    #Taxes  
How Switzerland Reinvented Itself As Cryptocurrency Haven,Darryn Pollock,7/6/2017 13:45,17295,1719,"Switzerland is enticing financial technology companies and startups to its already booming Crypto Valley by stripping down its regulations for services surrounding digital currencies and other financial services.The growth of financial technology, and the associated acceptance of its affiliates - such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - from State governments, has seen varying degrees of regulation from countries.However, it is Switzerland who is looking to lead the way in promoting the growth of this up-and-coming financial sector by applying a light touch to its rules and regulations for financial technology companies.In a statement made by Finance Minister Ueli Maurer, promises were made about re-evaluating banking legislation with the intention to allow smaller companies in financial technology to sidestep the red tape that is usually attached to larger banks.The proposed idea for minimizing regulations in Switzerland, while still keeping companies in line with legislation, is to set up so-called ‘sandboxes’ where startups and smaller companies can experiment and innovate within controlled conditions.Companies that have accumulated less than $1 mln in third-party funds would be welcomed to test out their innovative financial technology ideas without the usual regulation surrounding finance and digital currency.Banking licenses are also being re-evaluated to allow the companies that are coming in at under $1 mln to obtain licenses for those who offer deposits, but not lending.Finally, the Swiss government also wants to encourage crowdfunding for these companies by raising the currently legislated time that donors can withdraw their donations from seven days to 60. This will offer much greater security of funding.While these revised legislative changes are not aimed solely at digital currency, and Bitcoin for that matter, they encompass a large area of digital financial services that sweeps across cryptocurrencies at large.Blockchain technology and its decentralized cryptocurrency is a booming market that is attracting more and more startups and innovators that are driving the growth of this financial technology.No longer seen as purely a funding tool for dark web activities and the Silk Road, Bitcoin is attracting mainstream companies, especially in Switzerland, to grow Blockchain technology and digital currency services.Bitcoin and businesses utilizing Blockchain technologies, other digital currencies and related services are now being classified along with recognized financial technologies. Mobile telephone payment services, automated wealth management advice, price comparison apps, tailored social media groups and crowdfunding systems all fall under the same regulatory umbrella now.With governments tarring digital currencies with the same regulatory brush as they would innovative financial services, cryptocurrencies are being legitimized as well as encouraged to grow and innovate.Rather than shunning the innovation of digital money, the Swiss have embraced it and cleared its path to cut into volatile central bank controlled fiat currency markets, while also reducing fees and improving security on the technology.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Switzerland    #Cryptocurrencies    #FinTech    #Government    #Banks  
India: Top Ministerial Meeting On Bitcoin Draws Blank,William Suberg,6/29/2017 10:30,8955,346,"India is continuing its investigations into cryptocurrency after government officials voted in favor of regulation.An interministerial meeting held Tuesday by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley brought up “several issues concerning Bitcoins,” Business Today reports, without an immediate “decision” taken.India has faced mixed messages from senior government and central bank sources regarding the legality of cryptocurrency, prompting local businesses to issue clarifications themselves for worried consumers.Now the regulation appears to be practically inevitable in the short to medium term.

The Gox Effect: Japan Slowly Turning Against Bitcoin Exchanges (Op-Ed),Evander Smart,8/27/2015 8:36,620,0,"Bitcoin and Japan have had an interesting and strained relationship over the last three years. Businesses, exchanges, and digital currency trading have flourished, and even been encouraged to an extent, throughout the technologically cutting-edge country. Now, recent events and international backlash are starting to turn the national tide of perception against Bitcoin exchanges in the Land of the Rising Sun.When I first heard about Mt. Gox, by far the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange throughout 2012 and 2013, I didn’t know where it was. It was located in Japan, and was, in effect, the heart and soul of the Bitcoin community, giving Bitcoin a market pricing model that it needed join the financial world. It handled more than three out of every four Bitcoin transactions at its peak. Bitcoin may or may not have started in Japan, but it worked the most in Japan, even if most of its miners and customers were in The West.After Mt. Gox’s CEO Mark Karpeles took his eye off the ball, working on a Bitcoin cafe instead of strengthening a crumbling, poorly-sorted computer infrastructure; after people like Roger Ver physically went to the Japan office to work on weekends to try and compensate for its lack of leadership; and even after Mt. Gox collapses under a cloud of theft, ineptitude and neglect, Japan embraced the nascent technology, even as it cost its customers almost one million bitcoins in February of 2014.In this vain, the next month, government officials within the country decided to give Bitcoin a taste of economic amnesty. Bitcoin would not be treated or over-regulated as a bond or as a currency and bitcoins purchased from individuals will not be hit with a “Consumption Tax” of 8% either. In effect, a “Laisse-Faire”, anti-regulatory stance on bitcoin sales, purchases, and/or exchanges of bitcoins was created, buying the Bitcoin community in JapanGoing a step further, Japan even went so far as to allow the Bitcoin community to police itself, going forward through the newly-founded Japan Authority of Digital Assets (JADA). Supported by Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP)’s Information Technology committee, like the Federal Reserve in the United States, it would even go without direct government oversight or regulation, and work autonomously. Ah, those were the days. Alas, times have changed, and the climate has changed for Bitcoin as well, there, and worldwide.Mark Karpeles has been arrested not once, but twice for his alleged crimes against the Bitcoin community, including embezzlement and manipulating financial data. Tighter reins over how Bitcoin is handled have been called for in exchange for other forms of currency. Other countries have also taken the catchword of the day – terrorism – as an opportunity to drag Bitcoin’s name through the mud.Bitcoin’s PR efforts are virtually non-existent, so moves are being made to start to enact policy for how Japan treats cryptocurrency. Primarily to protect consumers from another Mt. Gox episode, anti-money laundering and terrorism regulations are being considered. The introduction of a registration or licensing system for operators of digital currency exchanges is being crafted.First reported by the Japan Times, Major Japanese regulators like The Finance Ministry, the Financial Services Agency, and the National Police Agency are expected to work with other relevant authorities on these changes. The current monetary laws on the transaction of financial products may be amended to include bitcoin and other digital currencies with legislation possibly heading to the regular Diet session next year.The FATF (Financial Action Task Force), an international anti-money laundering and terrorist funding regulator, released a new report in June that called for closer monitoring of digital currency exchanges worldwide. Recommendations within the “Guidance for a risk-based approach to virtual currencies” report stated that such exchanges should be registered and licensed like any other financial services and money transfer businesses.Governments are advised to require operators of such exchanges to confirm the identity of clients, keep digital records of transactions, and report any suspicious transactions to authorities.Over the last year, these types of changes are becoming more and more common in the world’s developed nations. The U.S. Treasury Department included bitcoin exchanges to their anti-money laundering regulations. Germany is working on putting Bitcoin transactions under its banking regulations. Banks and other financial institutions are banned from handling of virtual currencies in China, and Russia has gone so far as to block several Bitcoin-related websites in an attempt to stem the flow of information on cryptocurrency.The goal of making Bitcoin exchanges safe for consumers to use by a nation’s government is seemingly justified and is the right move to protect citizens. The real question will be where the regulatory line in the sand will be drawn. Regulators have a bad habit of asking for an inch and taking a mile, as we have seen in New York’s BitLicense fiasco, driving most businesses elsewhere.Japan seems destined to move from pure Bitcoin fandom to your run-of-the-mill Bitcoin regulator amongst nations.Exchanges will be the target, and hopefully, this is where the focus stays. The risk of third party exchanges has been the bane of the community due to their inability to regulate themselves. Now that police are assigned, and Bitcoin is being taken seriously as an asset class, hopefully this may cause greater mainstream adoption without the “Wild West” image and accompanying risk holding it back.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Mt.Gox    #Japan    #Bitcoin Exchanges  
Bitcoin Companies In London Consider George Osborne To Regulate A Problem Of Opening Bank Accounts,Erin Lace,11/12/2015 17:47,609,0,"George Osborne, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, has to resolve the problem of getting a bank account in the United Kingdom for Bitcoin-related companies. UK banks are currently refusing BTC businesses to open standard banking accounts. Thus, even if Bitcoin startups have FCA support and are licensed, they are still unable to operate without a traditional bank account. BTC market experts expect George Osborne to act after the announcement to support digital currencies-friendly regulations was made during the Bank of England's Open Forum on November 11.  George Basiladze, the CEO of Bitcoin wallet and exchange service Cryptopay.me based in London since 2013, faced a bunch of problems related to Bitcoin regulation in the UK during that time. Here’s what he said to Cointelegraph about the Osbourne’s initiative:“It’s very nice that Osbourne has mentioned bitcoins in his speech and we appreciate that. However, I do not think that this would result in any material change in current policy.""However, George Basiladze points out that the main problem in the UK is not government regulation, but the failure to get bank accounts:“You may have a favorable regulations and the FCA may support and license you. But if you cannot get a bank account (just a standard one) you cannot operate. This is easy. Not for BTC companies, though. If you say that you are doing anything connected to bitcoins and bitcoin exchange, you will not get a bank account in the UK. Banks do not like bitcoin companies as they make their compliance department’s head explode.Companies cannot provide truly innovative solutions with ~ zero fees, because they do not have the means to do that. No bank account is the way to additional fees, bad service and other issues.”Simon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager of Bitcoin Capital, also shared his opinion about the problem:“It is nothing new to hear a government state that they want their country to be the capital for Bitcoin startups. Most governments want the thousands of jobs that will be created from this new sector. However the reality is that regulators are independent of governments and banks have more control than both regulators and governments.”Michael Terpin, head of BitAngels, who’s spend enough time in London to be familiar with what's going on, commented to Cointelegraph:“The issue is a power struggle between the politicians (who want to please the electorate and promise growth and prosperity) and the regulators (who want to maintain and build their fiefdoms by adding more regulation).  In the middle are the banks, who are able to pressure both the regulators and politicians to protect their interests.”Michael Terpin gave an example of  such a situation last year when the Isle of Man officials made a big deal about how friendly they were going to be to Bitcoin - a Crypto Isle of sorts - but then after holding a conference to bring in major Bitcoin investors and companies, the central bankers and regulators said they still had concerns and fell back on the promise of bringing new business to the Isle of Man.“It's no surprise that UBS and JP Morgan are sounding the alarm on Bitcoin (while at the same time trying to create their own private blockchains).  Having a world power like the UK and one of the world's top financial hubs in London embrace it as an innovation greatly threatens their monopoly over the movement of money.  It's like when Western Union said more than 100 years ago that the telephone was of no possible use to anyone,” says Michael Terpin.George Osborne announced yesterday that he wants to make London a world leader in FinTech and cryptocurrencies. Osborne is going to make some changes to the existing regulations in the industry. Thus, changing the rules will influence greater innovation among the London Bitcoin community.George Osbourne is a well-known Bitcoin supporter. He realizes the meaning of cryptocurrencies for the development of the whole FinTech sector. That’s why he stays supportive of Bitcoin despite other European leaders expressing their skepticism towards it.In fact, this skepticism could be useful for achieving Osbourne’s goal as he can take advantage of cryptocurrencies for the development of the UK’s FinTech industry, while leaving all other European competitors in the dust. However, he realizes that, to do this, there have to be some regulatory changes. And he promises to deliver those changes.“Osborne is also promising an innovation-friendly approach to the regulation of new technologies such as cryptocurrencies,” states Finextra.The changes will surely have a great influence on FinTech and cryptocurrency, making them, perhaps, more convenient and customer-friendly.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #George Osborne    #Unired Kingdom    #Bank Accounts  
‘Chinese Policy Makers are Starting to Study and Rediscover the Bitcoin Industry’ - Huobi,Allen Scott,10/23/2015 16:36,606,0,"Following the exciting news out of China that points to a possible change in attitude by the government towards Bitcoin, Cointelegraph caught up with one of China’s biggest bitcoin exchanges, Huobi, to get a better understanding of Bitcoin’s prospects in the country.The Beijing-based exchange recently saw record BTC trading volumes among all exchanges. It should be noted, however, that trading CNY-BTC on Huobi is free, but fees are applied for USD-BTC trades making it similar to OkCoin, which is frequently associated with commission-free trading.“The Chinese government should study how digital currency is regulated in the US and follow the steps to establish our own regulation system.”- Huobi[Note: the following answers have been provided by several Huobi team members including CEO Leon Li.]Cointelegraph: How would you interpret the significance of the People's Daily article posted on the CAC website for our Western readers? Do you agree that we are in a “post-Bitcoin era”?Huobi: Recent bitcoin regulatory activities in the US have set an example for other countries including China. We agree that this “post-Bitcoin era” will inevitably lead to mainstream development in China.Shifting from volatility to stability requires regulation and rationality. The Chinese government should study how digital currency is regulated in the US and follow the steps to establish our own regulation system, so that Huobi and other bitcoin exchange platforms can compete positively under a standard legal framework and facilitate bitcoin development in the right direction.From a financial perspective, we think bitcoin can be seen as an investment similar to gold or a global standardized digital asset. As blockchain technology is being widely applied, bitcoin will be accepted by more companies and individuals. However, there’s still a long way before it is used as a currency.CT: What has been the reason we have been seeing record trading volumes on Huobi recently?Huobi: Huobi daily trading volume of bitcoin reached 770,000 BTC on October 22, which has made a new record among bitcoin exchanges. We think there are mainly three factors causing this spike in trading volume.First, the global finance market is experiencing a bounce back after the downturn this summer. Bitcoin market is one step ahead of other markets, which may lead to the rise of trading volume from a macro perspective.The first global blockchain summit was held in Shanghai recently, gathering hundreds of experts from official departments (PBC finance research institute, PBC credit reference center) banks, brokerages and other financial sectors. Huobi CEO Leon Li also attended the summit and the event drew much public attention to bitcoin and technology to strengthen investors’ faith as well.Meanwhile, Huobi became the first bitcoin exchange to launch 5X margin trade tool this September, which may have also stimulated users to trade more.CT: Could you update us on your Caimao platform that links the Shanghai stock exchange to bitcoin? How has the downward market trend affected its operations?Huobi: Caimao was created and aimed at becoming a one-stop investment service platform covering a variety of global financial products. We recently launched a new project allowing users to invest in stamps, coins and phone cards, which we think is an exclusive market in China.Moreover, we are also preparing trades of precious metals and planning to launch HK stocks and US stocks at the end of this year. Although China’s stock market is bearish now, with the impetus of Internet technology, the stamps market has already become the second largest investment market after A share market in China. With the Bitcoin industry being gradually regulated, the link between other investments and bitcoin will be on the right track in the future.CT: In our last interview you noted that Chinese stocks were “too hot to ignore” for many bitcoiners who were jumping onto the stock market. Now that the trend has reversed, are you seeing these traders return to bitcoin?Huobi: All financial products including stocks are related to capital flow and the economic cycle in the long run. Bitcoin performed well in the recent downturn on the global finance market. On one hand, this reflects the market’s positive attitude towards bitcoin; on the other hand it has concern with the rapid development of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.“[T]he number of new users on Huobi increased by about 127% compared with September. We believe more traders will return to bitcoin.”In the last two months, Huobi witnessed bitcoin price spike rapidly from the low of 1,238 yuan to 1,835 yuan. Up to October 11, the number of new users on Huobi increased by about 127% compared with September. We believe more traders will return to bitcoin.CT: Has there been significant growth in Bitcoin startups in China since the government announced subsidies for the fintech sector back in the summer?Huobi: The Chinese government announced subsidies for fintech sector this summer to support the development of such companies. However, Bitcoin companies are not clearly specified on the list. Therefore it's hard to say whether Bitcoin companies can benefit from the government’s policy or not.Given the fact that there are already some stable and mature enterprises in each segment, like mining, trading, media etc., there can't be too many new Bitcoin startups coming up in a short time. Chinese startups are less involved in the Bitcoin application field than their counterparts in the US. Considering the government’s resolution to encourage startups and innovations, we believe a bunch of startups based on Bitcoin application are, nevertheless, about to spring up.CT: Any updates on your  ""Digital Asset Research Initiative” with Tsinghua University?Huobi: Early this year, we announced our collaboration on ""Digital Asset Research Initiative"" with Wudaokou School of Finance of Tsinghua University. We will soon release a comprehensive report on global Bitcoin development after over six months of research. “Chinese policy makers are starting to study and rediscover the current status of the Bitcoin industry.”Meanwhile, by collaborating with Wudaokou School of Finance, which is jointly founded by the University and People's Bank of China, Huobi has more opportunities in communicating with Chinese policy makers for digital currency.This September, a research group conducted by officials from Beijing municipal bureau of financial work and experts who helped bring about the PBOC official notice of December 5, 2013, visited Huobi office to get more information and study the topic of digital currency and blockchain technology. During the meeting, the research group clearly pointed out the innovative implications of blockchain technology and revealed that they’re currently doing some research to establish a Bitcoin regulatory system, which is in the early stage of development.“Bitcoin is expected to be an important household asset and a safe haven when facing short-term financial crisis.”This means that Chinese policy makers are starting to study and rediscover the current status of the Bitcoin industry and we’re happy to be the only bitcoin exchange participating in this research project.CT: Bitcoin has been shown to increase in price where economic freedom is low and in times of financial uncertainty (e.g. Greece). In the event of another global financial crisis, do you think bitcoin will be the safe haven this time around for many people? Do the Chinese view bitcoin as a safe haven compared to gold, for example?Huobi: There’s an old saying in China: collect antiques in a thriving age, store gold when in chaos. Many Chinese investors gave priority to gold and silver for keeping value when global economic crisis and disasters happen. As a new type of commodity, ""digital gold"" bitcoin has seen impressive performance in the recent geopolitical turmoil and Greece crisis.Along with the announcement by CFTC on Bitcoin's status and the rapid development of blockchain technology, bitcoin is expected to be an important household asset and a safe haven when facing short-term financial crisis.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #China    #Huobi    #Leon Li  
‘Innovation is Like Toothpaste: It Can’t be Put Back in the Tube’,Daniel O. Nyairo,8/13/2015 14:37,184,0,"Cointelegraph spoke with Stuart Hoegner, the editor of the book titled “The Law Of Bitcoin” on his experience in being part of the team behind the project as well as his opinion on bitcoin regulation around the globe.The Law Of Bitcoin is a book published in June that provides legal guidance on Bitcoin issues in four countries; Canada, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States.Cointelegraph: In The Law Of Bitcoin you explore the legal status of Bitcoin in Canada, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States. How did you arrive at this list of countries?Stuart Hoegner: We wanted to delve into the details in each jurisdiction we covered. There are many resources out there that cover more countries, but in a cursory manner. Our project strives to cover fewer countries but in greater depth. We sought to include a non-common law jurisdiction (Germany), as well. We wanted truly expert and informed commentary. We had other countries on our list and could have included more, but we were only happy with the level of expertise that we had in these four, to start with.CT: The title of your book implies that it is a legal guide on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Why was it important to explain the technology in the first chapter?SH: This was our strategy for two critical reasons. First, this is still a new technology, especially to many members of the legal profession. To have a resource that's effective for lawyers and others working in the space, we absolutely had to try to describe the technology first. Second, we didn't want authors – and readers – to have to waste their time revisiting the intricacies of Bitcoin technology over successive chapters. So the introductory chapter describing the technology was imperative.“Law should always be the handmaiden to innovation. Innovation is like toothpaste: it can’t be put back in the tube.”CT: The Law Of Bitcoin is a combined effort by several individuals. Whose idea was it to write the book and what challenges did you face in coordinating the project?SH: It very much was a team effort. About two years ago, I had a vision of a book that leveraged different lawyers’ and academics’ expertise. At the same time, I started speaking with people who shared that vision, including Ryan Straus, Jillian Friedman, Paul Anning, and others. Together we started working on a strategy to make the project happen.The biggest challenge seemed like finding enough time for our authors to write. All of them are very busy with careers and full schedules, and they deserve a lot of credit for taking the time away from their lives to bring this to completion.CT: Part of the book’s foreword reads: “The law of Bitcoin is not only fast emerging, but in many ways already exists. It is only a matter of looking at precedent and statutes and applying them to the novel circumstances the new technology makes possible.” Who do you believe is to blame for the misconception that Bitcoin has been completely unregulated?SH: I think there may be a natural tendency to say that something that may not fit squarely into an existing paradigm or is new or disruptive is ""unregulated,"" but that word means different things to different people and in different contexts. The solution to a lack of clarity is to get back to the facts and an honest description of the technology, and then to prompt debate on its implications and meaning.CT: What role do you think the Bitcoin community in different jurisdictions should play to influence positive legal interpretation and legislation on cryptocurrency?SH: The international Bitcoin community – and national communities –can play a key role. Direct political action is always an option, although it’s still perhaps not a “big enough” issue for candidates for public office to pay attention. What might be more helpful is continuing engagement with the larger public, especially with skeptics. That provides education and community growth.CT: In your research for the book, what picture did you get on bitcoin’s adoption hinging on positive regulation? Is regulation critical or innovation will have its way at the end of the day?SH: Law should always be the handmaiden to innovation. Innovation is like toothpaste: it can’t be put back in the tube. Cryptocurrency is just one of the examples that are all around us: think about lending platforms, Kickstarter, disruptors like Uber, Airbnb, etc. What’s important is to have an honest discussion about the meaning – and, especially, the possibilities – of innovation, and to try to grapple with forms of sensible, proper regulation around that.CT: It is now almost three months since The Law Of Bitcoin was published. What has been the reception so far?SH: We have had some refreshing and welcome interest from several quarters. Many law libraries and firms are keen to have the book in their collections. Professionals and entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin space – very knowledgeable in their own right – have praised it and described it as a great value, which is exactly what we wanted. Our objective was to produce a highly useful, deeply analytical, and unsparing volume on what we know about the intersection of law and cryptocurrencies.“[…] many regulators have reacted very positively and rationally to the spread of blockchain technology.”CT: In your opinion, what main challenges do public institutions, at least those located in the countries you cover in the book, face in regulating cryptocurrency?SH: Knowledge of the technology, not overreaching, and taking seriously the law of unintended consequences. I think our book demonstrates that many regulators have reacted very positively and rationally to the spread of blockchain technology.“We remain optimistic that many regulators are trying to understand the technology first and act second.”CT: How does the regulators' lack of knowledge on cryptocurrency affect the legal interpretation of existing laws and future legislation?SH: It makes for bad law. How can one apply legal principles to technology that’s not fully understood? Thankfully, we remain optimistic that many regulators are trying to understand the technology first and act second.CT: Are other blockchain applications being overshadowed by Bitcoin as a currency in legal interpretation and legislations around the world?SH: To a certain extent, yes. In fact, that’s partly why the book is called “The Law of Bitcoin,” when it’s about more than just Bitcoin (the protocol) or bitcoin (the cryptocurrency). Bitcoin has come to be a bit of shorthand to refer to other cryptocurrencies and decentralized ledger technology in general. And that’s okay, so long as we understand that we’re using “Bitcoin” in such a broad way and we’re clear on the details with policy makers and the public.CT: Are you planning to publish a follow-up book on the same or related subject?SH: We’re still gauging reaction to the first edition, but if there’s sufficient interest and we can expand the reach of the book and what’s covered, there’s considerable interest in putting together a second edition. There are certainly enough ongoing legal developments to make it worthwhile.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Canada    #Germany    #United Kingdom    #United States    #Law  
"To Apply for Alaska Bitcoin Licence, Fork Over Your Fingerprints",Shivdeep Dhaliwal,3/27/2017 12:55,710,212,"Cryptocurrencies are in a gray zone when it comes to legislation in many parts of the world. In the United States, the situation can vary from state to state. Last year, North Carolina managed to pass a law that regulated Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but according to dcebrief.com, a similar attempt by Alaska did not meet success.The House Bill 180, which is being considered by the state legislature in Alaska, would make it compulsory for certain businesses to obtain a money transmission license. The bill has been introduced by Alaskan representatives Zach Fansler and Sam Kito. Companies that engage in the business of transmission, storage or exchange of cryptocurrencies would fall under the purview of this law.The proposed bill in the Alaskan legislature would make it binding for persons who apply for the money transmission license to fork over their fingerprints. The license applicant will also have to include all their personal history and experience. There is also a provision in the bill for the provision of security bonds by the applicant.The proposed legislation in Alaska provides a definition of what virtual currencies are. This could take away some legal ambiguity surrounding Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The bill states: “Virtual currency means a digital representation of value that does not have legal tender status in the United States but can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value; or is incorporated into payment system technology.” That definition also exempts cryptocurrency systems used only for loyalty rewards programs or those that are exclusively used within online gaming platforms.While regulation may be necessary, it should not stifle business and innovation. Some of the measures in the proposed Alaskan legislation seem extreme on the outset. Having to complete burdensome licensing applications may not be something that small businesses are capable of doing with limited resources.",3,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Hard Fork    #Law    #Cryptocurrencies  
"New Hampshire Legislators to Completely Deregulate Bitcoin, House Approved Bill",Joseph Young,3/10/2017 9:50,656,350,"On March 9, New Hampshire’s House of Representatives passed a bill that goes one step closer towards effectively exempting persons using virtual currency from registering as money transmitters.New Hampshire is considered one the world’s most Bitcoin-friendly states.According to the New Hampshire General Court Bill Status System, House Bill 436 has already been passed and adopted with an amendment by the House of Representatives and it is currently waiting for the Senate to grant the final approval of the bill.If approved by the Senate, HB 436 will free every user of Bitcoin and other digital currencies within New Hampshire from money transmission regulations, which may allow businesses such as Bitcoin exchanges within the state to operate without strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems.HB 436 was introduced, drafted and proposed by Keith Ammon, Barbara Biggie and John Hunt, who are early adopters and supporters of Bitcoin. In fact, Keith Ammon introduced many people to Bitcoin as early as May 2011, when Bitcoin wasn’t legal.Hunt played an important role in getting the bill passed by the House of Representatives, as he brought the bill out of committee, defended it with Ammon and ultimately convinced the House to pass the bill. Ammon is particularly dedicated to passing the bill in the state of New Hampshire due to his involvement with the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition formed to increase individual freedom.One of the main arguments presented by Hunt and Ammon when defending the bill was that if the US government doesn’t consider Bitcoin as legal tender, it shouldn’t fall under the regulatory guidance designed for money transmission services or products. The bill read:“‘Virtual currency’” means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States government.”If the bill is passed by the Senate within 60 days, or two months, New Hampshire residents will be able to utilize Bitcoin without being subjected to tight money transmission regulations or policies. While it is still unclear if this would allow businesses to refrain from collecting user identity and data for KYC regulations and AML purposes, it will grant users in New Hampshire financial freedom and privacy.Prior to the proposal of HB 436, some of the largest Bitcoin businesses, including digital currency exchange Poloniex, suspended their services in New Hampshire due to impractical regulations. In a notice to New Hampshire residents, Poloniex stated:“Due to changes in New Hampshire's regulatory statute as it applies to cryptocurrency, Poloniex will temporarily suspend New Hampshire account creation until further notice. For existing New Hampshire customers, you will receive an email with instructions on how to suspend your account.”The decision of Poloniex to pull out from New Hampshire was the result of the state’s introduction of its own New York BitLicense-like regulatory framework which created an inefficient ecosystem for local Bitcoin businesses.By passing the bill, the House, Senate and sponsors of the bill hope to see the Bitcoin market of New Hampshire grow at an exponential rate and encourage other states to ease regulations for emerging technologies.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #New Hampshire    #Poloniex  
Gemini Brings Regulated Bitcoin Exchanges to HK and Singapore,Joseph Young,10/3/2016 16:55,649,218,"Gemini, a regulated Bitcoin exchange founded by the Winklevoss Twins, is officially expanding its services to Hong Kong and Singapore.Registered users based in Hong Kong and Singapore can already begin trading USD with Bitcoin and Ethereum on Gemini’s advanced digital asset exchange.Although the Gemini trading platform in both countries only support US Dollars at the moment, Cameron announced that the company is working on adding HKD and SGD as it continues to expand to additional areas in Singapore and Hong Kong.Cameron Winklevoss announced:“As of today, registered customers in both the Lion City and the Pearl of the Orient can trade Bitcoin and Ether using the Gemini exchange.”“We’ll be opening HKD and SGD order books and expanding to additional areas of operation soon,” he added.On September 21, Gemini introduced the industry’s first daily Bitcoin auction to provide higher liquidity, transparency and simplicity for high profile traders.The auction, which initiates at a fixed schedule on a daily basis, enables traders to purchase larger amounts of Bitcoins with greater price discovery, lower fees, and instant settlement. Essentially, Gemini’s daily Bitcoin auction is a digital alternative to OTC trading.Cameron Winklevoss announced that Daily Auctions will be launched in Singapore and China as the part of the Gemini trading platform.The Gemini team believes that its Bitcoin Auctions feature will attract mainstream investors in securing substantially large investments in Bitcoin without dealing with the boundaries and friction present at most digital asset exchanges.“Auctions present an excellent opportunity for customers who want to execute large trades with over-the-counter (OTC) trading quantities on-exchange without having to worry about price slippage, exorbitant fees, and complicated settlement,” Winklevoss explained.With support for both regular Bitcoin traders and high profile OTC traders that often initiate in 7 to 8 figures buy orders of Bitcoins, Gemini has established a necessary infrastructure for the Bitcoin market in two of the most innovative leaders in the Asian Fintech market today.The launch of Gemini also provides competition amongst Bitcoin exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore, which are dominated by major trading platforms like Bitfinex. Users in both regions will benefit from a wider range of services and a variety of Bitcoin trading platforms to select from.Considering the difference in the vision of Gemini and other exchanges in the Asian market, users will be allowed to choose more suitable Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms that best fit their interests and level of trades.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Gemini    #Winklevoss Twins    #Singapore    #Hong Kong    #Cameron Winklevoss    #Auction    #Bitcoin Exchanges  
Bitcoin Banned in Taiwan after Billionaire BTC Ransom Attempt,Evander Smart,11/3/2015 8:54,910,0,"Just days after a Hong Kong tycoon was kidnapped, beaten, and held for millions of dollars in Bitcoin in ransom by criminals, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman of Taiwan, Tseng Ming-chung, has made a ruling. Bitcoin is now illegal within Taiwan.In many developed countries, a separate government body, like a Parliament or Congress, would create laws after a vetting process of checks and balances, with a somewhat legitimate voting process. The banking interests are presumed to control the action from behind closed doors. Not in Taiwan apparently, where the FSC, similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, has decided on its own that Bitcoin will no longer be allowed to be transmitted in Taiwan. The legislative controlling position of the financial industry is very clear and open in Taiwan.According to Focus Taiwan News, Tseng said in a hearing Monday that Bitcoin was illegal and he pledged that the FSC would work with the country's Central Bank and police to crack down any illegal activity. The FSC will also publish a statement jointly with the central bank to inform other countries of such regulations. This is tantamount to the SEC in the United States holding a press conference and saying: “Bitcoin is now illegal. We’ll tell federal law enforcement and the Federal Reserve what to do next regarding its future use.”As Cointelegraph recently reported, this FSC action follows the kidnapping of 68-year-old Pearl Oriental Oil chairman Wong Yuk-Kwan. According to the latest information on this case, the tycoon was allegedly abducted on September 20, then shackled and held for 70 million HK dollars, or over US$5M. He was in captivity until October 27, when he was rescued in a rare joint operation between Hong Kong and Taiwan police, who said no ransom money was paid by the Yuk-Kwan family countering previous that a bitcoin was sent to the kidnappers.Taiwan authorities believe one of Taiwan's biggest organized crime groups, the United Bamboo gang, was hired by persons unknown to snatch the businessman. Fifteen United Bamboo gang members have been arrested in association with this case. Sources say two of the suspects ventured to Hong Kong to collect the ransom money but were unsuccessful. They were followed by law enforcement back to houses in Taiwan, where Yuk-Kwan was held captive.The captors stayed in contact with the Wong family via email, and sent videos of Yuk-Kwan in distress, having him confirm and make demands of the family. One transmission was from October 22, where he said the following to his daughter:""My dearest daughter, it is Daddy. Today is October 22, 2015, on Thursday. Please come to help mum remit the remaining amount [of ransom] tomorrow. Stay strong. Wait for my return.""Yuk-Kwan is currently out on bail in his own criminal case, which has been adjourned until December 9. He is under suspicion of fraud and money-laundering in relation to the acquisition of an oil field within the United States.So to summarize, a crime against a billionaire means huge potential ramifications for the Taiwanese Bitcoin community. Wong Yuk-Kwan is safe and sound, receiving medical treatment for some facial injuries while awaiting trial in his own criminal case. No Bitcoin or money from the Yuk-Kwan family was lost to gangster criminals, who were apprehended. Yet, the people of Taiwan can theoretically no longer use Bitcoin, just because it was mentioned as means to an end by criminals looking for a ransom payment, which they never received.How Taiwan banking and law enforcement authorities plan to ban the transmission of bitcoin, which cannot be physically held, and can be sent digitally through smartphones, apps, websites, and the black market is as yet unknown.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Taiwan    #Banned Bitcoin    #Crimes  
China Could Make Bitcoin Buzz Again as National Congress Looms,Darryn Pollock,10/17/2017 10:15,25893,441,"Having felt China’s influence before, this week it is important to keep an eye on the communist state as they gear up for their 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).This form of elections essentially for the totalitarian party will see some reshuffling and power plays between top officials who either fall on the conservative side, or the progressive. In the middle is Bitcoin, and it is being used as a powerful political pawn.Held every five years, the party congress elects the party’s top officials. It is also a forum for a showdown between the conservative forces of the party, which want to preserve the old system of central planning and state ownership and control of key industries - including banking - and the progressive forces, which want to limit government ownership and control of the economy.""Understandably then Bitcoin is the new hammer and sickle of the progressive group while it flies in the face of the conservative traditionalists. This, many believed, is why it was banned in the first place, as a power play by the traditionalists.""Something similar seemed to happen back in 2011, at the 18th Congress, as Beijing went after a controversial Chinese corporate structure, Variable Interest Entity (VIE). This structure had allowed Chinese companies to list their shares in US exchanges through “reverse mergers.”However, this was not successful as Chinese Internet stocks crashed soon after.The congress begins on October 18, and its outcome could have a huge bearing on Bitcoin in the country - whether dooming it totally, or even lifting the regulatory bans.When China decided to ban, firstly, ICOs, and then exchanges, there was a tangible drop in price that was felt across the world. This sent the digital currency skidding from $5,100 down to close to $3,100.However, the Bitcoin price has recovered, and in fact reached new all time highs.At the same time, the ride may not be over, for even though the ban was touted as temporary, if the conservatives get the upper hand in the convention there could be more violent volatility to be faced.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #China    #ICO    #Bitcoin Price    #Banned Bitcoin  
Japanese Government Gets Involved in Mt. Gox Investigation,Joseph Young,8/5/2015 10:45,272,0,"The closure of Mt. Gox and the investigation of its founder have turned into a national scandal involving the Japanese government after it was revealed that the defunct exchange was bankrupt six months prior to its collapse.The recent upturn could be due to the Japanese media mistakenly reporting that the “Ex-Founder of Bitcoin was arrested” or the magnitude of the investigations.  The Japanese media is already misreporting that the former CEO of ""BITCOIN"" has been arrested. #mtgox pic.twitter.com/lBtkfpjWqnMeanwhile, Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso announced that the Japanese government will most likely set up regulations on digital currencies due to recent scandal.According to Japan Times, Aso has proposed a licensing system for bitcoin and digital currency exchange markets. He said at a news conference:“We have to carry out studies on how the government should regulate the use of virtual currencies.”Analysts predict that the Japanese proposal on a systematic licensing regulation will be extremely similar to New York’s BitLicense, and will require exchanges to report their transactions, funds, assets and perhaps even customer data.Thus, there are fears that such a system will negatively impact current Japanese bitcoin businesses forcing them to either shut down their services or leave the country as was the case in New York with Shapeshift.io, among others.Recent investigation led by the Japanese Police has concluded that Mt. Gox ran out of funds and bitcoins six months before the official filing of bankruptcy.The closure of Mt. Gox in February 2014 led to the loss of millions of dollars. While the investigation on Karpeles’ alleged manipulation of bitcoin accounts still remains unsettled, the Tyoko Police reported this week that the company ran out of money in August 2013, and had paid “top priority” bitcoin accounts for around six months before filing its bankruptcy.As investigations continue, the Japanese Police and law enforcement agencies will look into fund manipulations and corporate bank accounts of Mt. Gox, which held around 1.1 billion yen (~US$8.8 million). The Tyoko Police currently suspects that some of the funds were sent to a personal bank account or an affiliate of Mt. Gox.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Japan    #MT.Gox  
"London Called ‘Money Laundering Capital,’ While FinTech Startups Burdened by Regulation",Charlie Richards,7/7/2015 14:01,271,0,"An international crime expert has labeled London the center of international money laundering, saying the city's major banks disregard the anti-money laundering regulation that at the same time burdens FinTech startups.Roberto Saviano — the author of the popular crime investigation books “Gomorrah” and “Zero Zero Zero,” dealing with the Italian mafia and the cocaine trade, respectively — made the comment in an interview on July 4.In June, the UK's National Crime Agency published a report on the state of 'Serious and Organized Crime' in the country, which described how money laundering could impact London's reputation as an international financial capital. The report said:“In many cases, the crime is enabled by corruption; at the macro level this can undermine inward investment in the UK and, like money laundering, jeopardise the integrity of the UK as an international financial centre.”Speaking to the Observer on Sunday, Saviano said that “UK banks and financial services have ignored so-called ‘know your customer’ rules designed to curb criminals’ abilities to launder the proceeds of crime.” These anti-money laundering (AML) rules are the same set of regulations that have made it hard for digital currency companies to thrive while working to remain compliant the world over.Unlike the major UK banks, however, digital currency businesses have repeatedly been hit by authorities over failures to fulfill their AML requirements. Charlie Shrem the ex-CEO of BitInstant faces two years in jail following a prosecution for facilitating unlicensed money transmission.Cointelegraph spoke to Danial Daychopan, CEO of LazyPay, a London-based digital currency merchant payment processing platform, about the AML regulations that they also face. The startup has had to meet complex requirements to qualify for a UK Money Services Business license. Daychopan told CT about his frustration as a FinTech company trying to meet what he sees as outdated rules:""In the past year, large banks have received public backlash after they were found violating AML regulations. It's not just banks who have been hit hard for not doing due diligence in this area. Unfortunately, most Bitcoin companies have to jump through these same hoops, but we have hope for noncustodial businesses not having to comply with these archaic regulations.""In 2012, HSBC was forced to pay out US$1.9 billion in fines following what investigators described as a “blatant failure” to implement the AML regulations allowing “at least $881m in drug trafficking money [to be] laundered throughout the bank's accounts.” The bank more recently, in June, also had to pay US$44 million in fines to the Swiss banking authority over similar charges.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #London    #Money Laundering    #FinTech    #Startups    #AML    #Crimes    #KYC    #United Kingdom  
Joe Ciccolo – Regulators Are Warming Up to Digital Currency,Jacob Reagan,11/19/2015 8:00,269,0,"In the crypto-economic sphere, few groups are so crucial yet so scorned as those representing the regulatory body. Tragically, despite the well understood capacities to influence this space, there’s a painful lack of communication with those involved in crypto regulation because of these attitudes. Noting this deficiency, we spoke with Joe Ciccolo of BitAML to better explore the topic.Joe is a Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS), Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), and Anti-Money Laundering Certified Associate (AMLCA). Prior to launching BitAML, Joe was a founding member and architect of the BSA/AML program of a top 100 US-based financial institution. He also served as a project manager for a top 20 global bank, where he led several regulatory and audit remediation projects.Cointelegraph: As someone who works in the legal space for digital currencies, what drew your attention to digital currencies in particular? Is there a certain challenge or problem you think digital currencies can solve better than the older financial institutions?Joe Ciccolo: Traditional financial institutions are unable to innovative because they've convinced themselves it's impermissible. From my perspective, it's a business decision. Why in an era of IM and email, where one can securely send software, IP and legal documents around the world instantaneously, should consumers wait 5-7 days for a transaction to clear?When confronted by bitcoin, banks proceed to differentiate their services based on a higher degree of friction that the consumer does not want and enhancements to analog methods that at best will buy them time. Traditional institutions will continue to insist the answer is a faster horse, not an automobile.CT: In your opinion, how do the regulatory agencies seem to perceive this new technology? Are they more in line with the old sector touting ""we already have a system that works so why change it,"" or are they more excited to see how they can use this technology in a way that protects end users in good faith?JC: The regulatory community seems to be coming around when it comes to understanding the inherent risk mitigating and consumer protection properties of the blockchain. Regulators view new technology as possessing higher risk because illicit actors tend to gravitate to these platforms early on in order to exploit the knowledge gap and real or perceived control weaknesses.Regulators should now begin to look at the blockchain as a means of information sharing among institutions. The current system used by traditional bank AML programs - 314(b) - is extremely time consuming and ineffective. In essence, it's a voluntary analog system for sharing private ledgers that transmit, and thereby exposes, sensitive personal data.CT: Where do you see the regulatory environment heading from here? Do you have any connections or foresight that have given you hints as to what businesses and consumers might expect to face in the coming years?JC: Great questions. Looking ahead, while I believe exchanges, kiosks and other bitcoin platforms will continue to be regulated as MSBs, the compliance bar will be raised. State-level regulators and legal associations continue to convene working groups whose proposed regulatory frameworks contain enhanced requirements in areas such as consumer protection, cyber security, and auditing. Additionally, recent discussion and past history lead me to believe sought-after on-ramps or temporary licensing provisions are unlikely.CT: How would we know when the regulatory agencies have been diligent in their pursuits and successful in their goals?JC: A sure sign that the regulatory environment is moving in the right direction would be when regulators know and understand the risk mitigation inherent in the blockchain and accept new, unique and more tech-centric approaches to compliance.CT: Are there any parting thoughts you would like to leave our readers with?JC: I would only add that regulators need to step up and address the ""derisking"" of bitcoin MSB bank accounts. Sending out an agency press release or sound bite does not solve the problem. Simple, straightforward expectations of bank AML customer due diligence (CDD) can go a long way.Joe Ciccolo will be speaking at the upcoming Blockchain Agenda with Inside Bitcoins Conference & Expo in San Diego on December 14-16.

"KNC’s XBT ETN Introduced in Germany, Gaining Largest Market Yet",William Suberg,7/8/2015 19:59,263,0,"The second-largest German exchange Tradegate has implemented KNC’s XBT Provider ETN, the first regulated Bitcoin exchange-traded note.The move sees Germany overtake the pioneering Swedish market to become the largest worldwide, where both small- and large-scale investors can bet on the Bitcoin price via an ETN. BitcoinCommodities CEO Dennis Daiber told local news resource Bitcoinblog.de:“As soon as an ETN is created somewhere in the world, theoretically it can be introduced on any German exchange — there just has to be the demand from someone.”Demand for ETN from the Swedish Nasdaq has been brisk since its introduction on May 18, with activity on some days topping 2000 BTC. Enough, Bitcoinblog.de supposes, for Tradegate to consider its implementation into the traditionally Bitcoin-conservative German market.

Russia's Largest State-Owned Bank's Cafe Accepts Bitcoin,Joseph Young,9/28/2016 13:15,257,407,"A cafe located in Russia’s largest state-owned bank Sberbank, which has demonstrated an increasing interest in the development of Blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies, is officially accepting Bitcoin payments in Sberbank headquarters in Moscow, despite the confusion about the legality of the digital currency.After Roskomnadzor, the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications of Russia, banned P2P Bitcoin trading platform Localbitcoins, the legality of Bitcoin in Russia became unclear once again.Due to the unestablished regulatory frameworks and policies for Bitcoin in Russia, companies and merchants have refrained from accepting the digital currency as a payment option, with rising concerns that the central government may impose consequences for utilizing an unlicensed and regulated form of money.However, a cafe located in the headquarters of Russia’s largest bank has officially become the first merchant in the country to accept Bitcoin.The owner of the cafe, who serves and accommodates the majority of the bank headquarters’ employees, clients, and visitors, decided to accept Bitcoin after testing the digital currency and realizing its efficiency over cash or other payment methods as credit cards.Timofei Kulikov, the co-owner of the cafe, is also a law graduate who fully understands the regulatory frameworks and laws surrounding the financial ecosystem in Russia. He argued that since the transaction is directly between the customer and himself, no law prohibits his purchase of Bitcoins as an individual.Kulikov said in an interview:“There’s not a single law that would prohibit buying Bitcoins to me as an individual.” Kulikov did not directly integrate Bitcoin into its PoS system, because it might be illegal for a business to accept Bitcoin. Accepting Bitcoin directly from customers is not illegal, as there are no regulations in Russia currently in place that denies that right from individuals.Businesses and individual merchants in Russia are beginning to search for loopholes in the Russian financial regulations to search for ways to accept Bitcoin. It is a positive sign which shows the potential of the Russian market for Bitcoin companies.",[],  #Bitcoin News    #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Sberbank  
Smart Regulation Could Make Russia Next Major Bitcoin Market,Joseph Young,10/18/2017 0:45,20984,933,"Russia could evolve into the next major Bitcoin market, as the government continues to encourage Bitcoin mining and moves closer towards regulating its cryptocurrency exchange market.Earlier this week, Cointelegraph revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the launch of CryptoRuble, a cryptographically-secured state-issued national digital currency.Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov said:“I confidently declare that we run CryptoRuble for one simple reason: if we do not, then after two months our neighbors in the EurAsEC will.”Several analysts have speculated that the launch of CryptoRuble would likely lead to a nationwide ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, according to Putin, that is not the case and the Russian central bank has plans to regulate Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.In a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin explained that similar to other countries such as the US, Japan, and South Korea, Russia needs regulatory frameworks to oversee cryptocurrency trading and activities. However, he has no interest in banning digital currencies. Putin stated:“As is known, many countries are looking for ways of regulating the circulation of cryptocurrencies and are beginning to create the necessary legislative framework, a legislative regulatory system. We need – based on international experience – to build a regulatory environment that will make it possible to codify relations in this sphere, reliably protect the interests of citizens, businesses and the state and provide legal guarantees for using innovative financial instruments.”This is a big change from a week ago, when Putin condemned Bitcoin for its potential criminal uses.Russia is eyeing the regulation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies instead of an outright ban in order to retain some measure of control. If Russia bans cryptocurrencies, most trading activities will move to over-the-counter (OTC) markets and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platforms, which are extremely hard to censor and regulate. With trading platforms equipped with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems, the Russian government can prevent the usage of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in illegal activities.The Chinese government also recently issued a statement which implied that it is planning to introduce a national licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges, as it fears cryptocurrencies being associated with criminal activities.... and take measures such as record-keeping, licensing, AML processes, real-name, limiting large transactions (3/3)https://t.co/QS8bJWXdAZIn September, Alexander Drozdenko, the governor of the Russian Leningrad region, encouraged Bitcoin miners and mining facility operators to establish digital currency mining centers in the region to promote and encourage others to participate in the global Bitcoin mining industry.Local news publications including 47News reported:“Production sites that are being released during the construction of new power units of the Leningrad nuclear power plant will be available for new residents as early as 2018.”Drozdenko also told local reporters in a press conference covered by Bitcoin.com:“As you know, the construction of LNPP-2 is being completed in Sosnovy Bor, and large areas of the first nuclear power plant are being liberated, adding that this site may be of interest to cryptocurrency miners.”If Bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency exchange markets in Russia demonstrate an exponential rate of growth supported by regulatory frameworks released by the Russian government, Russia could evolve into the next major Bitcoin market in the long term.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Russia    #Putin    #Mining    #Cryptocurrency Exchange    #Investments    #Tradings    #China  
Bitcoin is Officially a Commodity in the U.S.,Jamie Redman,9/18/2015 11:59,795,0,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been officially deemed a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on September 17.The official CFTC press release reads:""In this order, the CFTC for the first time finds that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities.""  Now digital currencies such as bitcoin are in the same category as gold or oil in the U.S. This new authoritative policy gives the agency oversight with businesses operating with the virtual money and the means to regulate it.CFTC director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman:""While there is a lot of excitement surrounding bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets.""The agency also issued an order against Coinflip to cease and desist operations until the business is compliant, according to the CFTC press release. Coinflip was operating an online platform known as Derivabit, offering bitcoin derivatives to its clientele. The startup offered opportunities to purchase bitcoin option contracts, but were not compliant with CFTC regulations.However, the founder of Deravabits operations, Francisco Riordan said the CFTC was “fair,” adding that customers’ funds were refunded prior to this ruling. Now the company must file an application with the commission before reopening. There's been no mention of any other businesses operating without permission.  Recently the derivative exchange and clearinghouse LedgerX was granted temporary status with its registration for a Swap Execution Facility (SEF). The company has complied with previous commodity regulations by applying for SEF as a Derivative Clearing Organization on September 29, 2014.LedgerX founders believe that the temporary status will help them get their business off the ground and hope to be the first regulated clearing exchange within the institutional market. With the temporary status the startup will continue forward with the CFTC application over the next coming months.With LedgerX’s forward movement going well however, it should be noted the company is not the only exchange offering derivative options. Although, the company is different because it offers physical bitcoin contracts, TeraExchange is the first derivative exchange to work with U.S. regulators, offering products settled in dollars as opposed to bitcoin. ",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin News    #USA    #Cryptocurrencies    #LedgerX  
"Bitcoin Price Spooked by China, EU Regulatory Elephant In The Room",William Suberg,3/17/2017 13:13,720,288,"Legislative uncertainty in both China and Europe is weighing hard on the Bitcoin price, with around 10 percent lost in the past 24 hours.News is expected imminently of how Chinese authorities will go about regulating Bitcoin and its trading in the country, which historically has exerted considerable influence on the price of a coin.Following preliminary statements and feedback from People’s Bank of China Director Zhou Xuedong last week, markets are expecting a mixed bag of supervision and a “forgiving attitude” towards exchanges.However, Xuedong states certain “red lines” should remain uncrossed in terms of what services exchanges can offer.It is likely that full identification procedures will also need to be introduced and complied with, MarketWatch reports on Friday.Elsewhere, the European Union’s long-awaited virtual currency legislation has received final amendments prior to its assumed compliance deadline in June.Having spent almost two years at the deliberation and consultation stage, the controversial Directive (EU) 2015/849 could require owners of any virtual currency wallet to link their identity to it.Specifically, reference is made to “registering users' identities and wallet addresses accessible to FIUs, as well as self-declaration forms for the use of virtual currency users.”“Competent authorities should be able to monitor the use of virtual currencies in order to identify suspicious activities,” European Parliament states in an update.",[],  #Bitcoin Regulation    #Bitcoin Price    #China    #EU  
ICO Goes Extra Mile to Protect Contributors,Jon Buck,10/16/2017 15:40,8677,510,"Ask anyone in the crypto-sphere, and they’ll tell you the hot topic these days is regulation. After a couple of years of ‘wild west’ ICO and cryptocurrency explosion, governments have begun to crack down.Yet, some companies are taking the necessary steps to comply with the SEC regulations, thereby assuring their investors that they are a safe company to support. While this requires more time and far more effort, companies are seeking to protect their contributors and themselves as well.One company, Cappasity, has sought to create a token (the ARToken) for use within its own 3D VR image creation and distribution ecosystem, and has decided to comply with SEC regulations to protect their contributors. The company has hired the DLA Piper firm of Blockchain technology and legal experts to represent them through this process.In order to better understand what Cappasity is planning, and how complex the ICO regulation scene really is, Cointelegraph sat down with the firm’s representative, Leo Batalov. The interview is fascinating, and should reassure investors that Cappasity is willing to go the extra mile to make sure its contributors are safe.Cointelegraph: Let’s start with the basics. Is ICO a legal way of fundraising? Are there any countries where it is specified as illegal?Leo Batalov: An ICO can be a legal way to fundraise. An ICO, like any fundraising, must comply with applicable laws though. To start with, an ICO must comply with the securities regulations in the issuer’s jurisdiction and in every jurisdiction where the issuer makes offers or sales of its tokens. Securities regulations would apply if the token is a security within the meaning of the local law.Additionally (and even if the token is not a security), the issuer would have to comply with other applicable laws, such money laundering, privacy data protection, payment transmittal and so on. Different laws would apply in different jurisdictions and to different types of tokens, and the issuer would need to analyze all of these laws to be compliant.As of today, the regulators in China and South Korea have banned ICOs.  Regulators across the globe announced that they will scrutinize ICOs because of the risk of them being financial scams. However, so far only China and South Korea have decided to prohibit ICOs completely, rather than regulating them.CT: Speaking of illegal, what in your opinion is going on in China? First it was reported that ICOs have been completely banned there. Later, there were reports that the ban may be lifted in the future. What’s the overall goal of the Chinese government here, and how possible is it to conduct an ICO there right now?LB: I can’t even begin to guess the Chinese government’s plans here. The regulatory situation globally is extremely fluid. Things change daily, not even monthly or weekly. So, it is quite possible that the Chinese regulators clarify or change their position. Cryptocurrency trading volumes in China are some of the highest in the world, and the trading is difficult to monitor. I believe this concerns the Chinese government, which generally keeps close control of what is going on in China.I don’t believe it is legally possible to conduct an ICO in China. This means that a Chinese company cannot be an issuer, and offers and sale of tokens cannot be made in China.CT: When preparing for a campaign, what specific things does a company have to take care of, from a legal standpoint?LB: I would advise to first determine the countries where the company plans to fundraise. This should give the issuer a universe of jurisdiction - which laws it needs to analyze. Inevitably, the issuer would need to determine whether the token is a security, and if not, what it is under local law. After that, as I mentioned, the issuer would need to analyze other laws, which will depend on the nature of the token.CT: The Howey test is a topic which always comes up when it comes to conducting an ICO in the US. What is it and why is it important?LB: The Howey test is primarily important for US ICOs as it’s used to determine whether an instrument is an investment contract, a type of security under the US securities laws. Applying the Howey test to your token might be a useful exercise even for non-US ICOs.Without being hyper-technical, US securities regulations distinguish several types of securities. For example, shares in a company with rights to dividends, voting rights and the like are clearly securities. The Howey test is used to determine whether an investment scheme that does not easily fall under a specific category of security (such as a stock or bond) is an investment contract, and thus a security, or not. The Howey test is named after the case SEC v. Howey where the US Supreme Court laid out the analysis for what constitutes an investment contract, and cases that followed built on it. An arrangement is an investment contract (a security) if it involves 1. an investment of money; 2. in a common enterprise; 3. with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.Many ICOs would fall into this category, and if they do, they need to comply with US securities regulations. Most ICOs involve the purchase of tokens for another cryptocurrency (an investment of money), in a common enterprise (the business of the ICO issuer), with a reasonable expectation of profits (most token purchasers expect their tokens to appreciate in value) from the efforts of another (the ICO issuer’s management team). Obviously, each token is unique and not all tokens are investment contracts. The Howey test gives a framework to decide whether or not an issuer is required to comply with US securities regulations.CT: Utility and security tokens: what is the difference, and how does it impact the legality of a fundraising campaign?LB: A so-called “utility token” is a token that is not a security under the Howey test or otherwise. If a token is not a security, the issuer is not required to comply with applicable securities regulations. For example, a “utility token” may represent a right to receive goods or services in the future, effectively being a pre-payment. A “utility token” would generally give the issuer significantly more flexibility to market and sell its tokens.CT: What additional legal considerations are there, other than whether the token is classified as a security? Income taxation? Consumer protection?LB: Plenty. I already mentioned anti-money laundering, privacy data protection, payment transmittal (some ICO issuers take the position that their token is the “internal currency” of the platform or the ecosystem they are building). Depending on the token and the type of business, other laws and regulations might apply. These, however, would not be ICO-driven, and instead are the business model driven.Taxation is always a concern. In connection with an ICO, the issuer should consider whether the ICO proceeds are taxable. This will depend on the issuer’s jurisdiction of incorporation and other factors.CT: Do you have any expectations regarding the future of ICO regulation? How will governments around the world approach this matter, and what impact will their efforts have on the market?LB: I don’t have a crystal ball, but I expect the regulations to tighten in the short term, because many ICOs are non-compliant (and are abused by the promoters). In the long term, however, I expect this area to become reasonably regulated, with regulations striking the right balance between the fundraising efficiencies and investor protection.",4,  #Bitcoin Regulation    #ICO    #Tokens    #Cappasity    #SEC    #China    #USA    #Government
