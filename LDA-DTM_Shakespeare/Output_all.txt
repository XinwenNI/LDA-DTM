act i scene i london the palace enter king henry lord john of lancaster the earl of westmoreland sir walter blunt and others so shaken as we are so wan with care find we a time for frighted peace to pant and breathe shortwinded accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood nor more shall trenching war channel her fields nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes which like the meteors of a troubled heaven all of one nature of one substance bred did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance kindred and allies the edge of war like an illsheathed knife no more shall cut his master therefore friends as far as to the sepulchre of christ whose soldier now under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight forthwith a power of english shall we levy whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walkd those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were naild for our advantage on the bitter cross but this our purpose now is twelve month old and bootless tis to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now then let me hear of you my gentle cousin westmoreland what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience my liege this haste was hot in question and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news whose worst was that the noble mortimer leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower was by the rude hands of that welshman taken a thousand of his people butchered upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse such beastly shameless transformation by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land this matchd with other did my gracious lord for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on holyrood day the gallant hotspur there young harry percy and brave archibald that evervaliant and approved scot at holmedon met where they did spend a sad and bloody hour as by discharge of their artillery and shape of likelihood the news was told for he that brought them in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse uncertain of the issue any way here is a dear a true industrious friend sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse staind with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights balkd in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedons plains of prisoners hotspur took mordake the earl of fife and eldest son to beaten douglas and the earl of athol of murray angus and menteith and is not this an honourable spoil a gallant prize ha cousin is it not in faith it is a conquest for a prince to boast of yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son a son who is the theme of honours tongue amongst a grove the very straightest plant who is sweet fortunes minion and her pride whilst i by looking on the praise of him see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry o that it could be proved that some nighttripping fairy had exchanged in cradleclothes our children where they lay and calld mine percy his plantagenet then would i have his harry and he mine but let him from my thoughts what think you coz of this young percys pride the prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised to his own use he keeps and sends me word i shall have none but mordake earl of fife this is his uncles teaching this is worcester malevolent to you in all aspects which makes him prune himself and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity but i have sent for him to answer this and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem cousin on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us

and ugly mists of vapours that did seem to strangle him if all the year were playing holidays to sport would be as tedious as to work but when they seldom come they wishd for come and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents so when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised by how much better than my word i am by so much shall i falsify mens hopes and like bright metal on a sullen ground my reformation glittering oer my fault shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off ill so offend to make offence a skill redeeming time when men think least i will exit scene iii london the palace enter the king northumberland worcester hotspur sir walter blunt with others my blood hath been too cold and temperate unapt to stir at these indignities and you have found me for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself mighty and to be feard than my condition which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud our house my sovereign liege little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly my lord worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you exit worcester you were about to speak to north yea my good lord those prisoners in your highness name demanded which harry percy here at holmedon took were as he says not with such strength denied as is deliverd to your majesty either envy therefore or misprison is guilty of this fault and not my son my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressd fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reapd showd like a stubbleland at harvesthome he was perfumed like a milliner and twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncetbox which ever and anon he gave his nose and tookt away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talkd and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he calld them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questiond me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majestys behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pesterd with a popinjay out of my grief and my impatience answerd neglectingly i know not what he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waitinggentlewoman of guns and drums and woundsgod save the mark and telling me the sovereignst thing on earth was parmaceti for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villanous saltpetre should be diggd out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyd so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answerd indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty the circumstance considerd good my lord whateer lord harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place at such a time with all the rest retold may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said so he unsay it now why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brotherinlaw the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath wilfully betrayd the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damnd glendower whose daughter as we hear the earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we but treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severns sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severns flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank bloodstained with these valiant combatants never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds nor could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slanderd with revolt thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you my lord northumberland we licence your departure with your son send us your prisoners or you will hear of it exeunt king henry blunt and train an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile here comes your uncle reenter worcester speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part ill empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the downtrod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and cankerd bolingbroke brother the king hath made your nephew mad who struck this heat up after i was gone he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wifes brother then his cheek lookd pale and on my face he turnd an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer i cannot blame him was not he proclaimd by richard that dead is the next of blood he was i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king whose wrongs in us god pardondid set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered and for whose death we in the worlds wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown he did myself did hear it nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wished him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of yougod pardon ithave done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose an plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are foold discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banishd honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say peace cousin say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quickconceiving discontents ill read you matter deep and dangerous as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to oerwalk a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honour cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the palefaced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathomline could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this halffaced fellowship he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend good cousin give me audience for a while i cry you mercy those same noble scots that are your prisoners ill keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not ill keep them by this hand you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes those prisoners you shall keep nay i will thats flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear ill holla mortimer nay ill have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion hear you cousin a word all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same swordandbuckler prince of wales but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance i would have him poisond with a pot of ale farewell kinsman ill talk to you when you are better temperd to attend why what a waspstung and impatient fool art thou to break into this womans mood tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own why look you i am whippd and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richards timewhat do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bowd my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh at berkley castle you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me lookwhen his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale i have done nay if you have not to it again we will stay your leisure i have done i faith then once more to your scottish prisoners deliver them up without their ransom straight and make the douglas son your only mean for powers in scotland which for divers reasons which i shall send you written be assured will easily be granted you my lord to northumberland your son in scotland being thus employd shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate well beloved the archbishop of york is it not true who bears hard his brothers death at bristol the lord scroop i speak not this in estimation as what i think might be but what i know is ruminated plotted and set down and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on i smell it upon my life it will do well before the game is afoot thou still letst slip why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha and so they shall in faith it is exceedingly well aimd and tis no little reason bids us speed to save our heads by raising of a head for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we think ourselves unsatisfied till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love he does he does well be revenged on him cousin farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course when time is ripe which will be suddenly ill steal to glendower and lord mortimer where you and douglas and our powers at once as i will fashion it shall happily meet to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms which now we hold at much uncertainty farewell good brother we shall thrive i trust uncle adieu o let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport

as he hears owen glendower spoke of i cannot blame him at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes of burning cressets and at my birth the frame and huge foundation of the earth shaked like a coward why so it would have done at the same season if your mothers cat had but kittened though yourself had never been born i say the earth did shake when i was born and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinchd and vexd by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and mossgrown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemperature in passion shook cousin of many men i do not bear these crossings give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes the goats ran from the mountains and the herds were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields these signs have markd me extraordinary and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men where is he living clippd in with the sea that chides the banks of england scotland wales

cantle out ill have the current in this place dammd up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here not wind it shall it must you see it doth yea but mark how he bears his course and runs me up with like advantage on the other side gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other

well go to but markd him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summerhouse in christendom in faith he is a worthy gentleman exceedingly well read and profited in strange concealments valiant as a lion and as wondrous affable and as bountiful as mines of india shall i tell you cousin he holds your temper in a high respect and curbs himself even of his natural scope when you come cross his humour faith he does i warrant you that man is not alive might so have tempted him as you have done without the taste of danger and reproof but do not use it oft let me entreat you in faith my lord you are too wilfulblame and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite beside his patience you must needs learn lord to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness courage blood and thats the dearest grace it renders you yet

scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only markd for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matchd withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart so please your majesty i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg as in reproof of many tales devised which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wanderd and irregular find pardon on my true submission god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruind and the soul of every man prophetically doth forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so commonhackneyd in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wonderd at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dressd myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from mens hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical neer seen but wonderd at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with capering fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffd himself to popularity that being daily swallowd by mens eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sunlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and renderd such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord be more myself for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my sceptre and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor colour like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lions armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what neverdying honour hath he got against renowned douglas

deeds for my indignities percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the

nay task me to my word approve me lord thou art the king of honour no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him do so and tis well enter a messenger with letters what letters hast thou therei can but thank you these letters come from your father letters from him why comes he not himself he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a rustling time who leads his power under whose government come they along his letters bear his mind not i my lord i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed he did my lord four days ere i set forth and at the time of my departure thence he was much feard by his physicians i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited his health was never better worth than now sick now droop now this sickness doth infect the very lifeblood of our enterprise tis catching hither even to our camp he writes me here that inward sickness and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possessd of all our purposes what say you to it your fathers sickness is a maim to us a perilous gash a very limb loppd off and yet in faith it is not his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes faith and so we should where now remains a sweet reversion we may boldly spend upon the hope of what is to come in a comfort of retirement lives in this a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs but yet i would your father had been here the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause for well you know we of the offering side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement and stop all sightholes every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your fathers draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom with his help we shall oerturn it topsyturvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole as heart can think there is not such a word spoke of in scotland as this term of fear enter sir richard vernon my cousin vernon welcome by my soul pray god my news be worth a

painted cloth where the gluttons dogs licked his sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and a long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient and such have i to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services that you

pressed the dead bodies no eye hath seen such scarecrows ill not march through coventry with them thats flat nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed i had

expedition certain horse of my cousin vernons are not yet come up your uncle worcesters horse came but today and now their pride and mettle is asleep their courage with hard labour tame and dull that not a horse is half the half of himself so are the horses of the enemy in general journeybated and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest the number of the king exceedeth ours for gods sake cousin stay till all come in the trumpet sounds a parley enter sir walter blunt i come with gracious offers from the king if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy and god defend but still i should stand so so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty but to my charge the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot which he confesseth to be manifold he bids you name your griefs and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the worlds regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performd it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths gave him their heirs as pages followd him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his countrys wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war tut i came not to hear this then to the point in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that taskd the whole state to make that worse sufferd his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the councilboard in rage dismissd my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which we find too indirect for long continuance shall i return this answer to the king not so sir walter well withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawnd some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell i would you would accept of grace and love and may be so we shall pray god you do exeunt scene iv york the archbishops palace enter the archbishop of york and sir michael hie good sir michael bear this sealed brief with winged haste to the lord marshal this to my cousin scroop and all the rest to whom they are directed if you knew how much they do to import you would make haste my good lord i guess their tenor like enough you do tomorrow good sir michael is a day wherein the fortune of ten thousand men must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury as i am truly given to understand the king with mighty and quickraised power meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael what with the sickness of northumberland whose power was in the first proportion and what with owen glendowers absence thence who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in oerruled by prophecies i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king why my good lord you need not fear there is douglas and lord mortimer no mortimer is not there but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors noble gentlemen and so there is but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales lord john of lancaster the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt and moe corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed i hope no less yet needful tis to fear and to prevent the worst sir michael speed for if lord percy thrive not ere the king dismiss his power he means to visit us for he hath heard of our confederacy and tis but wisdom to make strong against him therefore make haste i must go write again to other friends and so farewell sir michael exeunt act v scene i king henry ivs camp

his distemperature the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blustering day then with the losers let it sympathize for nothing can seem foul to those that win the trumpet sounds enter worcester and vernon how now my lord of worcester tis not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet you have deceived our trust and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well my lord this is not well what say you to it will you again unknit this curlish knot of allabhorred war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times hear me my liege for mine own part i could be well content to entertain the lagend of my life with quiet hours for i do protest i have not sought the day of this dislike you have not sought it how comes it then rebellion lay in his way and he found it peace chewet peace it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house and yet i must remember you my lord we were the first and dearest of your friends for you my staff of office did i break in richards time and posted day and night to meet you on the way and kiss your hand when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i it was myself my brother and his son that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time you swore to us and you did swear that oath at doncaster that you did nothing purpose gainst the state nor claim no further than your newfalln right the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid but in short space it raind down fortune showering on your head and such a flood of greatness fell on you what with our help what with the absent king what with the injuries of a wanton time the seeming sufferances that you had borne and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly wood to gripe the general sway into your hand forget your oath to us at doncaster and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle hull the cuckoos bird useth the sparrow did oppress our nest grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing we were enforced for safety sake to fly out of sight and raise this present head whereby we stand opposed by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind usage dangerous countenance and violation of all faith and troth sworn to us in your younger enterprise these things indeed you have articulate proclaimd at marketcrosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such watercolours to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter if once they join in trial tell your nephew the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes this present enterprise set off his head i do not think a braver gentleman more activevaliant or more valiantyoung more daring or more bold is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds for my part i may speak it to my shame i have a truant been to chivalry and so i hear he doth account me too yet this before my fathers majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation and will to save the blood on either side try fortune with him in a single fight and prince of wales so dare we venture thee albeit considerations infinite do make against it no good worcester no we love our people well even those we love that are misled upon your cousins part and will they take the offer of our grace both he and they and you every man shall be my friend again and ill be his so tell your cousin and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office so be gone we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair take it advisedly exeunt worcester and vernon it will not be accepted on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms hence therefore every leader to his charge for on their answer will we set on them and god befriend us as our cause is just exeunt all but prince henry and

lance hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him here there and every where enraged he flew the french exclaimd the devil was in arms all the whole army stood agazed on him his soldiers spying

frame the law unto my will judge you my lord of warwick then between us between two hawks which flies the higher pitch between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth between two blades which bears the better temper between two horses which doth bear him best between two girls which hath the merriest eye i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement but in these nice sharp quillets of the law good faith i am no wiser than a daw richard tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out and on my side it is so well apparelld so clear so shining and so evident that it will glimmer through a blind mans eye richard since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts let him that is a trueborn gentleman and stands upon the honour of his birth if he suppose that i have pleaded truth from off this brier pluck a white rose with me let him that is no coward nor no flatterer but dare maintain the party of the truth pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me i love no colours and without all colour of base insinuating flattery i pluck this white rose with plantagenet i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more till you conclude that he upon whose side the fewest roses are croppd from the tree shall yield the other in the right opinion good master vernon it is well objected if i have fewest i subscribe in silence richard and i then for the truth and plainness of the case i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here giving my verdict on the white rose side prick not your finger as you pluck it off lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red and fall on my side so against your will if i my lord for my opinion bleed opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt and keep me on the side where still i am well well come on who else unless my study and my books be false the argument you held was wrong in you to somerset in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too richard now somerset where is your argument here in my scabbard meditating that shall dye your white rose in a bloody red richard meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses for pale they look with fear as witnessing the truth on our side no plantagenet tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error richard hath not thy rose a canker somerset hath not thy rose a thorn plantagenet richard ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood well ill find friends to wear my bleeding roses that shall maintain what i have said is true where false plantagenet dare not be seen richard now by this maiden blossom in my hand i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet richard proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee ill turn my part thereof into thy throat away away good william de la pole we grace the yeoman by conversing with him now by gods will thou wrongst him somerset his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence third son to the third

any plot of ground in christendom was not thy father richard earl of cambridge for treason executed in our late kings days and by his treason standst not thou attainted corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood and till thou be restored thou art a yeoman richard my father was attached not attainted condemnd to die for treason but no traitor and that

and angry rose as cognizance of my blooddrinking hate will i for ever and my faction wear until it wither with me to my grave or flourish to the height of my degree go forward and be choked with thy ambition and so farewell until i meet thee next exit have with thee pole farewell ambitious richard exit richard how i am braved and must perforce endure it this blot that they object against your house shall be wiped out in the next parliament calld for the truce of winchester and gloucester and if thou be not then created york i will not live to be accounted warwick meantime in signal of my love to thee against proud somerset and william pole will i upon thy party wear this rose and here i prophesy this brawl today grown to this faction in the templegarden shall send between the red rose and the white a thousand souls to death and deadly night richard good master vernon i am bound to you that you on my behalf would pluck a flower in your behalf still will i wear the same and so will i

of my weak decaying age let dying mortimer here rest himself even like a man new haled from the rack so fare my limbs with long imprisonment and these grey locks the pursuivants of death nestorlike aged in an age of care argue the end of edmund mortimer these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent wax dim as drawing to their exigent weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief and pithless arms like to a witherd vine that droops his sapless branches to the ground yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb unable to support this lump of clay swiftwinged with desire to get a grave as witting i no other comfort have but tell me keeper will my nephew come richard plantagenet my lord will come we sent unto the temple unto his chamber and answer was returnd that he will come enough my soul shall then be satisfied poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine since henry monmouth first began to reign before whose glory i was great in arms this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscured deprived of honour and inheritance but now the arbitrator of despairs just death kind umpire of mens miseries with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expired that so he might recover what was lost enter richard plantagenet my lord your loving nephew now is come richard plantagenet my friend is he come richard ay noble uncle thus ignobly used your nephew late despised richard comes direct mine arms i may embrace his neck and in his bosom spend my latter gasp o tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks that i may kindly give one fainting kiss and now declare sweet stem from yorks great stock why didst thou say of late thou wert despised richard first lean thine aged back against mine arm and in that ease ill tell thee my disease this day in argument upon a case some words there grew twixt somerset and me among which terms he used his lavish tongue and did upbraid me with my fathers death which obloquy set bars before my tongue else with the like i had requited him therefore good uncle for my fathers sake in honour of a true plantagenet and for alliance sake declare the cause my father earl of cambridge lost his head that cause fair nephew that imprisond me and hath detaind me all my flowering youth within a loathsome dungeon there to pine was cursed instrument of his decease richard discover more at large what cause that was for i am ignorant and cannot guess i will if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done henry the fourth grandfather to this king deposed his nephew richard edwards son the firstbegotten and the lawful heir of edward king the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north finding his usurpation most unjust endeavord my advancement to the throne the reason moved these warlike lords to this was for thatyoung king richard thus removed leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence the third son to king edward the third whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree being but fourth of that heroic line but mark as in this haughty attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir i lost my liberty and they their lives long after this when henry the fifth succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign thy father earl of cambridge then derived from famous edmund langley duke of york marrying my sister that thy mother was again in pity of my hard distress levied an army weening to redeem and have installd me in the diadem but as the rest so fell that noble earl and was beheaded thus the mortimers in whom the tide rested were suppressd richard of which my lord your honour is the last true and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care richard thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet methinks my fathers execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny with silence nephew be thou politic strongfixed is the house of lancaster and like a mountain not to be removed but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts when they are cloyd with long continuance in a settled place richard o uncle would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill mourn not except thou sorrow for my good only give order for my funeral and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war dies richard and peace no war befall thy parting soul in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpassd thy days well i will lock his counsel in my breast and what i do imagine let that rest keepers convey him hence and i myself will see his burial better than his life exeunt gaolers bearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer choked with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs those bitter injuries which somerset hath offerd to my house i doubt not but with honour to redress

thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one before we met or that a stroke was given like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men myself and divers gentlemen beside were there surprised and taken prisoners then judge great lords if i have done amiss or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood yea or no to say the truth

virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes he then that is not furnishd in this sort

done me wrong what is that wrong whereof you both complain first let me know and then ill answer you crossing the sea from england into france this fellow here with envious carping tongue upbraided me about the rose i wear saying the sanguine colour of the leaves did represent my masters blushing cheeks when stubbornly he did repugn the truth about a certain question in the law argued betwixt the duke of york and him with other vile and ignominious terms in confutation of which rude reproach and in defence of my lords worthiness i crave the benefit of law of arms and that is my petition noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent yet know my lord i was provoked by him and he first took exceptions at this badge pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewrayd the faintness of my masters heart will not this malice somerset be left your private grudge my lord of york will out though neer so cunningly you smother it good lord what madness rules in brainsick men when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise good cousins both of york and somerset quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace let this dissension first be tried by fight and then your highness shall command a peace the quarrel toucheth none but us alone betwixt ourselves let us decide it then there is my pledge accept it somerset nay let it rest where it began at first confirm it so mine honourable lord confirm it so confounded be your strife and perish ye with your audacious prate presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us and you my lords methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course it grieves his highness good my lords be friends come hither you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you as you love our favour quite to forget this quarrel and the cause and you my lords remember where we are in france amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to wilful disobedience and rebel beside what infamy will there arise when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy a thing of no regard king henrys peers and chief nobility destroyd themselves and lost the realm of france o think upon the conquest of my father my tender years and let us not forego that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife i see no reason if i wear this rose putting on a red rose that any one should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown because forsooth the king of scots is crownd but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore as we hither came in peace so let us still continue peace and love cousin of york we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france and good my lord of somerset unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot and like true subjects sons of your progenitors go cheerfully together and digest your angry choler on your enemies ourself my lord protector and

thou foul accursed minister of hell enter cardinal of winchester attended cardinal lord regent i do greet your excellence with letters of commission from the king for know my lords the states of christendom moved with remorse of these outrageous broils have earnestly implored a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth to confer about some matter is all our travail turnd to this effect after the slaughter of so many peers so many captains gentlemen and soldiers that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their countrys benefit shall we at last conclude effeminate peace have we not lost most part of all the towns by treason falsehood and by treachery our great progenitors had conquered o warwick warwick i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france be patient york if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby enter charles alencon bastard of orleans reignier and others since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaimd in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poisond voice by sight of these our baleful enemies cardinal charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute submit thyself thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him and still enjoy thy regal dignity must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless tis known already that i am possessd with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquishd detract so much from that prerogative as to be calld but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador ill rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all insulting charles hast thou by secret means used intercession to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise standst thou aloof upon comparison either accept the title thou usurpst of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunity to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serves how sayst thou charles shall our condition stand it shall only reserved you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england so now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensign let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace exeunt scene v london the palace enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi gloucester and exeter your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonishd me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed loves settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so fullreplete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous chaste intents to love and honour henry as her lord and otherwise will henry neer presume therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be englands royal queen so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betrothd unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vowd to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversarys odds a poor earls daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel yes lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferrd for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be linkd in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assured i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crownd king henrys faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexed with a thousand cares and you good uncle banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief exit ay grief i fear me both at first and last exeunt gloucester and exeter thus suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes as did the youthful paris once to greece with hope to find the like event in love but prosper better than the trojan did margaret shall now be queen

of love unite our thoughts great king of england and my gracious lord the mutual conference that my mind hath had by day by night waking and in my dreams in courtly company or at my beads with you mine alderliefest sovereign makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms such as my wit affords and overjoy of heart doth minister her sight did ravish but her grace in speech her words

queen margaret and suffolk brave peers of england pillars of the state to you duke humphrey must unload his grief your grief the common grief of all the land what did my brother henry spend his youth his valour coin and people in the wars did he so often lodge in open field in winters cold and summers parching heat to conquer france his true inheritance and did my brother bedford toil his wits to keep by policy what henry got have you yourselves somerset buckingham brave york salisbury and victorious warwick received deep scars in france and normandy or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learned council of the realm studied so long sat in the councilhouse early and late debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes and shall these labours and these honours die shall henrys conquest bedfords vigilance your deeds of war and all our counsel die o peers of england shameful is this league fatal this marriage cancelling your fame blotting your names from books of memory razing the characters of your renown defacing monuments of conquerd france undoing all as all had never been nephew what means this passionate discourse this peroration with such circumstance for france tis ours and we will keep it still ay uncle we will keep it if we can but now it is impossible we should suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse now by the death of him that died for all these counties were the keys of normandy but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son for grief that they are past recovery for were there hope to conquer them again my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears anjou and maine myself did win them both those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds delivered up again with peaceful words mort dieu for suffolks duke may he be suffocate that dims the honour of this warlike isle france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but englands kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages a proper jest and never heard before that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her she should have stayed in france and starved in france before my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king my lord of winchester i know your mind tis not my speeches that you do mislike but tis my presence that doth trouble ye rancour will out proud prelate in thy face i see thy fury if i longer stay we shall begin our ancient bickerings lordings farewell and say when i am gone i prophesied france will be lost ere long exit so there goes our protector in a rage tis known to you he is mine enemy nay more an enemy unto you all and no great friend i fear me to the king consider lords he is the next of blood and heir apparent to the english crown had henry got an empire by his marriage and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west theres reason he should be displeased at it look to it lords let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect what though the common people favour him calling him humphrey the good duke of gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voice jesu maintain your royal excellence with god preserve the good duke humphrey i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector why should he then protect our sovereign he being of age to govern of himself cousin of somerset join you with me and all together with the duke of suffolk well quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat this weighty business will not brook delay ill to the duke of suffolk presently exit cousin of buckingham though humphreys pride and greatness of his place be grief to us yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displaced hell be protector or thou or i somerset will be protector despite duke humphrey or the cardinal exeunt buckingham and somerset pride went before ambition follows him while these do labour for their own preferment behoves it us to labour for the realm i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o the church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey and brother york thy acts in ireland in bringing them to civil discipline thy late exploits done in the heart of france when thou wert regent for our sovereign have made thee feard and honourd of the people join we together for the public good in what we can to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal with somersets and buckinghams ambition and as we may cherish duke humphreys deeds while they do tend the profit of the land so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country aside  and so says york for he hath greatest cause then lets make haste away and look unto the main unto the main o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win and would have kept so long as breath did last main chance father you meant but i meant maine which i will win from france or else be slain exeunt warwick and salisbury anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter i cannot blame them all what ist to them tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans still revelling like lords till all be gone while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shared and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargaind for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnd unto the princes heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile englands soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevils parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for thats the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and englands dearbought queen and humphrey with the peers be falln at jars then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce ill make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pulld fair england down exit scene ii gloucesters house

warwick our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to englands crown my lord i long to hear it at full sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevils are thy subjects to command then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the thirds death reignd as king till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crownd by the name of henry the fourth seized on the realm deposed the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murderd traitorously father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first sons heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reignd but william of hatfield died without an heir the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claimed the crown had issue philippe a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king who kept him in captivity till he died but to the rest his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was son to edmund langley edward the thirds fifth son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippe sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king what plain proceeding is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till lionels issue fails his should not reign it fails not yet but flourishes in thee and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock then father salisbury kneel we together and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honour of his birthright to the crown long live our sovereign richard

himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a faroff look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he as the next will mount me seemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come

instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted tut these are petty faults to faults unknown which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for hes disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for hes inclined as is the ravenous wolf who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man enter somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign welcome lord somerset what news from france that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you all is lost cold news lord somerset but gods will be done aside  cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave enter gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king pardon my liege that i have stayd so long nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me wherein am i guilty tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayed the soldiers pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france is it but thought so what are they that think it i never robbd the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france so help me god as i have watchd the night ay night by night in studying good for england that doit that eer i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trialday no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i disbursed to the garrisons and never askd for restitution it serves you well my lord to say so much i say no more than truth so help me god in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamed by tyranny why tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offenders tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured above the felon or what trespass else my lord these faults are easy quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial my lord of gloucester tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspect my conscience tells me you are innocent ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancours hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exiled your highness land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice and suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have pluckd back by false accuse doth level at my life and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirrd up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog my liege his railing is intolerable if those that care to keep your royal person from treasons secret knife and traitors rage be thus upbraided chid and rated at and the offender granted scope of speech twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couchd as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to oerthrow his state but i can give the loser leave to chide far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they playd me false and well such losers may have leave to speak hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day lord cardinal he is your prisoner sirs take away the duke and guard him sure ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first ah that my fear were false ah that it were for good king henry thy decay i fear exit guarded my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best do or undo as if ourself were here what will your highness leave the parliament ay margaret my heart is drownd with grief whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes my body round engirt with misery for whats more miserable than discontent ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see the map of honour truth and loyalty and yet good humphrey is the hour to come that eer i proved thee false or feard thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do nought but wail her darlings loss even so myself bewails good gloucesters case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimmd eyes look after him and cannot do him good so mighty are his vowed enemies his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan say whos a traitor gloucester he is none exeunt all but queen margaret cardinal suffolk and york somerset remains apart free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucesters show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolld in a flowering bank with shining chequerd slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us of the fear we have of him that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death tis meet he be condemnd by course of law but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death so that by this you would not have him die ah york no man alive so fain as i tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls weret not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the kings protector so the poor chicken should be sure of death madam tis true and weret not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accused a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature proved an enemy to the flock before his chaps be staind with crimson blood as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit thricenoble suffolk tis resolutely spoke not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed and ill provide his executioner i tender so the safety of my liege here is my hand the deed is worthy doing and so say i and i    and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom enter a post great lords from ireland am i come amain to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword send succors lords and stop the rage betime before the wound do grow uncurable for being green there is great hope of help a breach that craves a quick expedient stop what counsel give you in this weighty cause that somerset be sent as regent thither tis meet that lucky ruler be employd witness the fortune he hath had in france if york with all his farfet policy had been the regent there instead of me he never would have stayd in france so long no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burthen of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar characterd on thy skin mens flesh preserved so whole do seldom win nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his what worse than nought nay then a shame take all and in the number thee that wishest shame my lord of york try what your fortune is the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men collected choicely from each county some and try your hap against the irishmen i will my lord so please his majesty why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs a charge lord york that i will see performd but now return we to the false duke humphrey no more of him for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more and so break off the day is almost spent lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers for there ill ship them all for ireland ill see it truly done my lord of york exeunt all but york now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hopest to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth the enjoying let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man and find no harbour in a royal heart faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake who cherishd in your breasts will sting your hearts twas men i lackd and you will give them me i take it kindly and yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madmans hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious suns transparent beams do calm the fury of this madbred flaw and for a minister of my intent i have seduced a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the title of john mortimer in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long till that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharpquilld porpentine and in the end being rescued i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells full often like a shaghaird crafty kern hath he conversed with the enemy and undiscoverd come to me again and given me notice of their villanies this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons mind how they affect the house and claim of york say he be taken rackd and tortured i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms say that he thrive as tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sowd for humphrey being dead as he shall be and henry put apart the next for me exit scene ii bury st

prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman pray god he may acquit him of suspicion i thank thee meg these words content me much reenter suffolk how now why lookst thou pale why tremblest thou where is our uncle whats the matter suffolk dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead marry god forfend gods secret judgment i did dream tonight the duke was dumb and could not speak a word king henry vi

gracious lord comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me came he right now to sing a ravens note whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers and thinks he that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the firstconceived sound hide not thy poison with such sugard words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpents sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double death now gloucesters dead why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christianlike laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heartoffending groans or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded and princes courts be filld with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crownd with infamy ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucesters tomb why then dame margaret was neer thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wreckd upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from englands bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpions nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards englands blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cowerd in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnestgaping sight of thy lands view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wishd thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair englands view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and calld them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albions wished coast how often have i tempted suffolks tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his fathers acts commenced in burning troy am i not witchd like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long noise within enter warwick salisbury and many commons it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorously is murderd by suffolk and the cardinal beauforts means the commons like an angry hive of bees that want their leader scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge myself have calmd their spleenful mutiny until they hear the order of his death that he is dead good warwick tis too true but how he died god knows not henry enter his chamber view his breathless corpse and comment then upon his sudden death that shall i do my liege stay salisbury with the rude multitude till i return exit o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphreys life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthly image what were it but to make my sorrow greater reenter warwick and others bearing gloucesters body on a bed come hither gracious sovereign view this body that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his fathers wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thricefamed duke a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue what instance gives lord warwick for his vow see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless being all descended to the labouring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and neer returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eyeballs further out than when he lived staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair upreard his nostrils stretched with struggling his hands abroad displayd as one that graspd and tuggd for life and was by strength subdued look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his wellproportiond beard made rough and rugged like to the summers corn by tempest lodged it cannot be but he was murderd here the least of all these signs were probable why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers but both of you were vowd duke humphreys foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep tis like you would not feast him like a friend and tis well seen he found an enemy then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphreys timeless death who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy are you the butcher suffolk wheres your knife is beaufort termd a kite where are his talons i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murders crimson badge say if thou darest proud lord of warwickshire that i am faulty in duke humphreys death exeunt cardinal somerset and others what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times madam be still with reverence may i say for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor if ever lady wrongd her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutord churl and noble stock was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevils noble race but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereigns presence makes me mild i would false murderous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meantst that thou thyself was born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood if from this presence thou darest go with me away even now or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art ill cope with thee and do some service to duke humphreys ghost exeunt suffolk and warwick what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though lockd up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted a noise within what noise is this reenter suffolk and warwick with their weapons drawn why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence dare you be so bold why what tumultuous clamour have we here the traitorous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me mighty sovereign to the commons entering  sirs stand apart the king shall know your mind dread lord the commons send you word by me unless lord suffolk straight be done to death or banished fair englands territories they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingering death they say by him the good duke humphrey died they say in him they fear your highness death and mere instinct of love and loyalty free from a stubborn opposite intent as being thought to contradict your liking makes them thus forward in his banishment they say in care of your most royal person that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death yet notwithstanding such a strait edict were there a serpent seen with forked tongue that slily glided towards your majesty it were but necessary you were waked lest being sufferd in that harmful slumber the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal and therefore do they cry though you forbid that they will guard you whether you will or no from such fell serpents as false suffolk is with whose envenomed and fatal sting your loving uncle twenty times his worth they say is shamefully bereft of life within  an answer from the king my lord of salisbury tis like the commons rude unpolishd hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employd to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king within  an answer from the king or we will all break in go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolks means and therefore by his majesty i swear whose far unworthy deputy i am he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer on the pain of death exit salisbury o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable if after three days space thou here best found on any ground that i am ruler of the world shall not be ransom for thy life come warwick come good warwick go with me i have great matters to impart to thee exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk

cease gentle queen these execrations and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave fie coward woman and softhearted wretch hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them would curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan i would invent as bittersearching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear deliverd strongly through my fixed teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as leanfaced envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fixed on end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burthend heart would break should i not curse them poison be their drink gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks their softest touch as smart as lizards sting their music frightful as the serpents hiss and boding screechowls make the concert full all the foul terrors in darkseated hell enough sweet suffolk thou tormentst thyself and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass or like an overcharged gun recoil and turn the force of them upon thyself you bade me ban and will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banishd from well could i curse away a winters night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assured adventure to be banished myself and banished i am if but from thee go speak

gasp and stare and catch the air blaspheming god and cursing men on earth sometimes he talks as if duke humphreys ghost were by his side sometime he calls the king and whispers to his pillow as to him the secrets of his overcharged soul and i am sent to tell his majesty that even now he cries aloud for him go tell this heavy message to the king exit vaux ay me what is this world what news are these

but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap here could i breathe my soul into the air as mild and gentle as the cradlebabe dying with mothers dug between its lips where from thy sight i should be raging mad and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul or i should breathe it so into thy body and then it lived in sweet elysium to die by thee were but to die in jest from thee to die were torture more than death o let me stay befall what may befall away though parting be a fretful corrosive it is applied to a deathful wound to france sweet suffolk let me hear from thee for wheresoeer thou art in this worlds globe ill have an iris that shall find thee out i go and take my heart with thee a jewel lockd into

and ten to one is no impeach of valour they lay hands on york who struggles ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin so doth the cony struggle in the net so triumph thieves upon their conquerd booty so true men yield with robbers so oermatchd what would your grace have done unto him now brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be englands king wast you that revelld in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are

oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henrys glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead that is my office for my fathers sake nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth how illbeseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonderd at tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a womans face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutlands obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman beshrew me but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touchd would not have staind with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears this cloth thou dipdst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tellst the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand hardhearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads had he been slaughterman to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul what weepingripe my lord northumberland think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears heres for my oath heres for my fathers death stabbing him and

have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watchd him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassd round with dogs who having pinchd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmd like a younker prancing to his love dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but severd in a pale clearshining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vowd some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one

blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whateer it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fairshining suns nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male enter a messenger but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue ah one that was a woful lookeron when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord o speak no more for i have heard too much say how he died for i will hear it all environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enterd troy but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hew down and fell the hardesttimberd oak by many hands your father was subdued but only slaughterd by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crownd the gracious duke in high despite laughd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that eer i viewd sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquishd him for hand to hand he would have vanquishd thee now my souls palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy i cannot weep for all my bodys moisture scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name ill venge

now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befalln after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king musterd my soldiers gatherd flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought marchd toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henrys oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who lookd full gently on his warlike queen that robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of cliffords rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheerd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but neer till now his scandal of retire nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henrys head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer i know it well lord warwick blame me not tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time whats to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our avemaries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easymelting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak neer may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou failstas god forbid the hour must edward fall which peril heaven forfend no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is englands royal throne for king of england shalt thou be

thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mothers tongue but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul misshapen stigmatic markd by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be calld the sea shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and neer was agamemnons brother wrongd by that false woman as this king by thee his father revelld in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matchd according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday even then that sunshine brewd a shower for him that washd his fathers fortunes forth of france and heapd sedition on his crown at home for what hath broachd this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slippd our claim until another age but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring and that thy summer bred us no increase we set the axe to thy usurping root and though the edge hath something hit ourselves yet know thou since we have begun to strike well never leave till we have hewn thee down or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods and in this resolution i defy thee not

drunken with our blood ill kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like softhearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were playd in jest

chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say ill cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford ill make my heaven in a ladys lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my  mothers womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to cheque to oerbear such as are of better person than myself ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live to account this world but hell until my misshaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and ilike one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall ill slay more gazers than the basilisk ill play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off ill pluck it down exit scene iii france king lewis xis palace flourish enter king lewis xi his sister bona  his admiral called bourbon prince edward queen  margaret and oxford king lewis xi sits and riseth up again fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albions queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares whateer it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eased if france can yield relief those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banishd man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of englands trueanointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henrys heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off the more we stay the stronger grows our foe the more i stay the more ill succor thee o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow enter warwick whats he approacheth boldly to our presence our earl of warwick edwards greatest friend welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france he descends she ariseth ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to englands king in lawful marriage aside  if that go forward henrys hope is done to bona  and gracious madam in our kings behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereigns heart where fame late entering at his heedful ears hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edwards wellmeant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henrys son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs injurious margaret and why not queen because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdoms worth why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellowd years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster and i the house of york queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick they stand aloof heavens grant that warwicks words bewitch him not now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour but is he gracious in the peoples eye the more that henry was unfortunate then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground the leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain now sister let us hear your firm resolve your grant or your denial shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your kings desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire then warwick thus our sister shall be edwards and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoised draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king to edward but not to the english king deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henrys friend and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edwards good success then tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france peace impudent and shameless warwick peace proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather post blows a horn within warwick this is some post to us or thee enter a post to warwick  my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquess montague to king lewis xi these from our king unto your majesty to queen margaret and madam these for you from whom i know not they all read their letters i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope alls for the best warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this the alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner i told your majesty as much before this proveth edwards love and warwicks honesty king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edwards no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass the abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdond at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state warwick these words have turnd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomest king henrys friend so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers ill undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his newmade bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me hes very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country dear brother how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair my quarrel and this english queens are one and mine fair lady bona joins with yours and mine with hers and thine and margarets therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid let me give humble thanks for all at once then englands messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willow garland for his sake tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long theres thy reward be gone exit post but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwicks daughter shall be thine yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand he gives his hand to warwick why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shalt waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by wars mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france exeunt all but warwick i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and ill be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henrys misery but seek revenge on edwards mockery exit act iv scene i london the palace enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return my lords forbear this talk here comes the king and his wellchosen bride i mind to tell him plainly what i think flourish enter king edward iv attended queen elizabeth pembroke stafford hastings and others now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that theyll take no offence at our abuse suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwicks and must have my will and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well yea brother richard are you offended too not i no god forbid that i should wish them severd whom god hath joind together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and englands queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise yet to have joind with france in such alliance would more have strengthend this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself but the safer when tis backd with france tis better using france than trusting france let us be backd with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood or else you would not have bestowd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wifes son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee in choosing for yourself you showd your judgment which being shallow you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brothers will my lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath aside  i hear yet say not much but think the more enter a post now messenger what letters or what news from france my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage these were her words utterd with mad disdain tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willow garland for his sake i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henrys queen for i have heard that she was there in place tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries he more incensed against your majesty than all the rest discharged me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarnd they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwicks daughter belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwicks other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me exit clarence and somerset follows aside  not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect so god help montague as he proves true and hastings as he favours edwards cause now brother richard will you stand by us ay in despite of all that shall withstand you why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power exeunt scene ii a plain in warwickshire enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence come speak suddenly my lords are we all friends fear not that my lord then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edwards brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in nights coverture thy brother being carelessly encampd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well coverd with the nights black mantle at unawares may beat down edwards guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader they all cry henry why then lets on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george exeunt scene iii edwards camp near warwick enter three watchmen to guard king edward ivs tent come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep what will he not to bed why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppressd tomorrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent tis the lord hastings the kings chiefest friend o is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field tis the more honour because more dangerous ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken him unless our halberds did shut up his passage ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from nightfoes enter warwick clarence oxford somerset and french soldiers silent all this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honour now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours who goes there stay or thou diest warwick and the rest cry all warwick warwick  and set upon the guard who fly crying arm arm warwick and the rest following them the drum playing and trumpet sounding reenter  warwick somerset and the rest bringing king  edward iv out in his gown sitting in a chair richard and hastings fly over the stage what are they that fly there richard and hastings let them go here is the duke the duke why warwick when we parted thou calldst me king ay but the case is alterd when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the peoples welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies yea brother of clarence are thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortunes malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel then for his mind be edward englands king takes off his crown but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyd unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows ill follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him now for a while farewell good duke of york they lead him out forcibly what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide exit guarded what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers ay thats the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne exeunt scene iv london the palace enter queen elizabeth and rivers madam what makes you in this sudden change why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befalln king edward what loss of some pitchd battle against warwick no but the loss of his own royal person then is my sovereign slain ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner either betrayd by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares and as i further have to understand is new committed to the bishop of york fell warwicks brother and by that our foe these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may warwick may lose that now hath won the day till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edwards offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortunes cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edwards fruit true heir to the english crown but madam where is warwick then become i am informd that he comes towards london to set the crown once more on henrys head guess thou the rest king edwards friends must down but to prevent the tyrants violence for trust not him that hath once broken faith ill hence forthwith unto the sanctuary to save at least the heir of edwards right there shall i rest secure from force and fraud come therefore let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die exeunt scene v a park near middleham castle in yorkshire enter gloucester hastings and stanley now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him this way my lord for this way lies the game nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishops deer brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the parkcorner but whither shall we then to lynn my lord and ship from thence to flanders well guessd believe me for that was my meaning stanley i will requite thy forwardness but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along better do so than tarry and be hangd come then away lets ha no more ado bishop farewell shield thee from warwicks frown and pray that i may repossess the crown exeunt scene vi london the tower flourish enter king henry vi clarence warwick  somerset henry of richmond oxford montague and lieutenant of the tower master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turnd my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majesty for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure ill well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty but warwick after god thou setst me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortunes spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessed land may not be punishd with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortunes malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place no warwick thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent and i choose clarence only for protector warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sins rebuke and my creators praise what answers clarence to his sovereigns will that he consents if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself why then though loath yet must i be content well yoke together like a double shadow to henrys body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate what else and that succession be determined ay therein clarence shall not want his part but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed it shall be done my sovereign with all speed my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care my liege it is young henry earl of richmond come hither englands hope lays his hand on his head if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our countrys bliss his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a sceptre and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me enter a post what news my friend that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundy unsavoury news but how made he escape he was conveyd by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishops huntsmen rescued him for hunting was his daily exercise my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide exeunt all but somerset henry of richmond and oxford my lord i like not of this flight of edwards for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars before t be long as henrys late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and ours therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst forthwith well send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity ay for if edward repossess the crown tis like that richmond with the rest shall down it shall be so he shall to brittany come therefore lets about it speedily exeunt scene vii before york flourish enter king edward iv gloucester hastings and soldiers now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my waned state for henrys regal crown well have we passd and now repassd the seas and brought desired help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom the gates made fast brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within tush man abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us my liege ill knock once more to summon them enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren my lords we were forewarned of your coming and shut the gates for safety of ourselves for now we owe allegiance unto henry but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york true my good lord i know you for no less why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone aside  but when the fox hath once got in his nose hell soon find means to make the body follow why master mayor why stand you in a doubt open the gates we are king henrys friends ay say you so the gates shall then be opend they descend a wise stout captain and soon persuaded the good old man would fain that all were well so twere not long of him but being enterd i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason enter the mayor and two aldermen below so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys takes his keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me march enter montgomery with drum and soldiers brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived welcome sir john but why come you in arms to help king edward in his time of storm as every loyal subject ought to do thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest then fare you well for i will hence again i came to serve a king and not a duke drummer strike up and let us march away the drum begins to march nay stay sir john awhi le and well debate by what safe means the crown may be recoverd what talk you of debating in few words if youll not here proclaim yourself our king ill leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succor you why shall we fight if you pretend no title why brother wherefore stand you on nice points when we grow stronger then well make our claim till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns brother we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends then be it as you will for tis my right and henry but usurps the diadem ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself and now will i be edwards champion sound trumpet edward shall be here proclaimd come fellowsoldier make thou proclamation flourish edward the fourth by the grace of god king of england and france and lord of ireland  and c and whosoeer gainsays king edwards right by this i challenge him to single fight throws down his gauntlet long live edward the fourth thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all if fortune serve me ill requite this kindness now for this night lets harbour here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon well forward towards warwick and his mates for well i wot that henry is no soldier ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee to flatter henry and forsake thy brother yet as we may well meet both thee and warwick come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day and that once gotten doubt not of large pay exeunt scene viii london the palace flourish enter king henry vi warwick montague clarence exeter and oxford what counsel lords edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath passd in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him lets levy men and beat him back again a

the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine the doubt is that he will seduce the rest thats not my fear my meed hath got me fame i have not stoppd mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allayd their swelling griefs my mercy dried their waterflowing tears i have not been

men virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves made you lose your city it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost that you were made of is metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost tis too cold a companion away with t i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin theres little can be said in t tis against the rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the canon keep it not you cannot choose but loose byt out with t within ten year it will make itself ten which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse away with t how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking let me see marry ill to like him that neer it likes tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth off with t while tis vendible answer the time of request virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but

confound distinction yet stand off in differences so mighty if she be all that is virtuous save what thou dislikest a poor physicians daughter thou dislikest of virtue for the name but do not so from lowest place when virtuous things proceed the place is dignified by the doers deed where great additions swells and virtue none it is a dropsied honour good alone is good without a name vileness is so the property by what it is should go not by the title she is young wise fair in these to nature shes immediate heir and these breed honour that is honours scorn which challenges itself as honours born and is not like the sire honours thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers the mere words a slave deboshd on every tomb on every grave a lying trophy and as oft is dumb where dust and damnd oblivion is the tomb of honourd bones indeed what should be said if thou canst like this creature as a maid i can create the rest virtue and she is her own dower honour and wealth from

youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee in the name of justice without all terms of pity speak thine answer pardon my gracious lord for i submit my fancy to your eyes when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it i find that she which late was in my nobler thoughts most base is now the praised of the king who so ennobled is as twere born so take her by the hand and tell her she is thine to whom i promise a counterpoise if not to thy estate a balance more replete i take her hand good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon

natures fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of nature enter touchstone no when nature hath made a fair creature may she not by fortune fall into the fire though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when fortune makes natures natural the cutteroff of natures wit

now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment exeunt act ii scene i the forest of arden enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords like foresters now my comates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we but the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winters wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in every thing i would not change it happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gored indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banishd you today my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequesterd stag that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much then being there alone left and abandond of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assignd and native dwellingplace and did you leave him in this contemplation we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then hes full of

graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles and she believes wherever they are gone that youth is surely in their company send to his brother fetch that gallant hither if he be

farewell kind master why how now adam no greater heart in thee live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little if this uncouth forest yield any thing savage i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers for my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the arms end i will here be with thee presently and if i bring thee not something to eat i will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before i come thou art a mocker of my labour well said thou lookest cheerly and ill be with thee quickly yet thou liest in the bleak air come i will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live any thing in this desert cheerly good adam exeunt scene vii the forest a table set out enter duke senior amiens and lords like outlaws i think he be transformd into a beast for i can no where find him like a man my lord he is but even now gone hence here was he merry hearing of a song if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres go seek him tell him i would speak with him enter jaques he saves my labour by his own approach why how now monsieur what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company what you look merrily a fool a fool i met a fool i the forest a motley fool a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and baskd him in the sun and raild on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lacklustre eye says very wisely it is ten oclock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deepcontemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool a worthy fool motleys the only wear what fool is this o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places crammd with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat thou shalt have one it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise mans folly is anatomized even by the squandering glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of the infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do what for a counter would i do but good most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all the embossed sores and headed evils that thou with licence of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the weary very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the citywoman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not of my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right then he hath wrongd himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies unclaimd of any man but who comes here enter orlando with his sword drawn forbear and eat no more why i have eat none yet nor shalt not till necessity be served of what kind should this cock come of art thou thus boldend man by thy distress or else a rude despiser of good manners that in civility thou seemst so empty you touchd my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath taen from me the show of smooth civility yet am i inland bred and know some nurture but forbear i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered an you will not be answered with reason i must die what would you have your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness i almost die for food and let me have it sit down and feed and welcome to our table speak you so gently pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whateer you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have lookd on better days if ever been where bells have knolld to church if ever sat at any good mans feast if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and know what tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolld to church and sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be ministerd then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limpd in pure love till he be first sufficed oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit go find him out and we will nothing waste till you return i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort exit thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and

touchstone truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherds life it is naught in respect that it is solitary i like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious as is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in court shepherd no truly then thou art damned nay i hope truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all on one side for not being at court your reason why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest good manners if thou never sawest good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous state shepherd not a whit touchstone those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds

surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the courtiers hands are perfumed with civet most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat mend the instance shepherd you have too courtly a wit for me ill rest wilt thou rest damned god help thee shallow man god make incision in thee thou art raw sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get that i wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match if thou beest not damned for this the devil himself will have no shepherds i cannot

you came for look here what i found on a palmtree i was never so berhymed since pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i can hardly remember trow you who hath done this is it a man and a chain that you once wore about his neck change you colour i prithee who o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter nay but who is it is it possible nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all hooping good my complexion dost thou think though i am caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition one inch of delay more is a southsea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that may drink thy tidings so you may put a man in your belly is he of gods making what manner of man is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard nay he hath but a little beard why god will send more if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestlers heels and your heart both in an instant nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maid i faith coz tis he orlando orlando alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and hose what did he when thou sawest him what said he how looked he wherein went he what makes him here did he ask for me where remains he how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again answer me in one word you must borrow me gargantuas mouth first tis a word too great for any mouth of this ages size to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism but doth he know that i am in this forest and in mans apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn it may well be called joves tree when it drops forth such fruit give me audience good madam proceed there lay he stretched along like a wounded knight though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets unseasonably he was furnished like a hunter o ominous he comes to

them illfavouredly rosalind is your loves name yes just i do not like her name there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened what stature is she of just as high as my heart you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them out of rings not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions you have a nimble wit i think twas made of atalantas heels will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults the worst fault you have is to be in love tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am weary of you by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you he is drowned in the brook look but in and you shall see him there i shall see mine own figure which i take to be either a fool or a cipher ill tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur melancholy exit jaques aside to celia  i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester very well what would you i pray you what ist oclock you should ask me what time o day theres no clock in the forest then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal i prithee who doth he trot withal marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year who ambles time withal with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal who doth he gallop withal with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there who stays it still withal with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves where dwell you pretty youth with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat are you native of this place as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it i prithee recount some of them no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him i am he that is so loveshaked i pray you tell me your remedy there is none of my uncles marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner what were his marks a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak neither rhyme nor reason can express how much love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel did you ever cure any so yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart that there shall not be one spot of love int i would not be cured youth i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me now by the faith of my love i will tell me where it is go with me to it and ill show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go with all my heart good youth nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go exeunt scene iii the forest enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind come apace good audrey i will fetch up your goats audrey and how audrey am i the man yet doth my simple feature content you your features lord warrant us what features i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths aside  o knowledge illinhabited worse than jove in a thatched house when a mans verses cannot be understood nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room truly i would the gods had made thee poetical i do not know what poetical is is it honest in deed and word is it a true thing no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical i do truly for thou swearest to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign would you not have me honest no truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar aside  a material fool well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may be i will marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us aside  i would fain see this meeting well the gods give us joy amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts but what though c ourage as horns are odious they are necessary it is said many a man knows no end of his goods right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed no as a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is a horn more precious than to want here comes sir oliver enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel is there none here to give the woman i will not take her on gift of any man truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful advancing proceed proceedill give her good even good master whatyecallt how do you sir you are very well met god ild you for your last company i am very glad to see you even a toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered will you be married motley as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp aside  i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife go thou

weep his very hair is of the dissembling colour something browner than judass marry his kisses are judass own children i faith his hair is of a good colour an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not nay certainly there is no truth in him do you think so yes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a horsestealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a wormeaten nut not true in love yes when he is in but i think he is not in you have heard him swear downright he was was is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke your father i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando o thats a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides who comes here enter corin mistress and master you have oft inquired after the shepherd that complaind of love who you saw sitting by me on the turf praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress well and what of him if you will see a pageant truly playd between the pale complexion of true love and

bloody drops enter rosalind celia and corin behind i would not be thy executioner i fly thee for i would not injure thee thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frailst and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be calld tyrants butchers murderers now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean but upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is no force in eyes that can do hurt o dear phebe if everas that ever may be near you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy then shall you know the wounds invisible that loves keen arrows make but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes afflict me with thy mocks pity me not as till that time i shall not pity thee and why i pray you who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched what though you have no beauty as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed must you be therefore proud and pitiless why what means this why do you look on me i see no more in you than in the ordinary of natures salework ods my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too no faith proud mistress hope not after it tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman tis such fools as you that makes the world full of illfavourd children tis not her glass

sorrow and my grief were both extermined thou hast my love is not that neighbourly i would have you why that were covetousness silvius the time was that i hated thee and yet it is not that i bear thee love but since that thou canst talk of love so well thy company which erst was irksome to me i will endure and ill employ thee too but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employd so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scatterd smile and that ill live upon knowst now the youth that spoke to me erewhile not very well but i have met him oft and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of think not i love him though i ask for him tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well but what care i for words yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear it is a pretty youth not very pretty but sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him hell make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up he is not very tall yet for his years hes tall his leg is but so so and yet tis well there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference between the constant red and mingled damask there be some women silvius had they markd him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am rememberd scornd at me i marvel why i answerd not again but thats all one omittance is no quittance ill write to him a very taunting letter and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius phebe with all my heart ill write it

fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundrys contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands yes i have gained my experience and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too enter orlando good day and happiness dear rosalind nay then god be wi you an you talk in blank verse exit farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and

another trick never come in my sight more my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise break an hours promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but ill warrant him heartwhole pardon me dear rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i had as lief be wooed of a snail of a snail ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him whats that why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife virtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous and i am your rosalind it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind i would kiss before i spoke nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lackinggod warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss how if the kiss be denied then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter who could be out being before his beloved mistress marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit what of my suit not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her well in her person i say i will not have you then in mine own person i die no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicit in a lovecause troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it then love me rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all and wilt thou

handkercher was staind i pray you tell it when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinkd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bushs shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suckd and hungry lioness twice did he turn his back and purposed so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked are you his brother wast you he rescued wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him twas i but tis not ii do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am but for the bloody napkin by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed as how i came into that desert place in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brothers love who led me instantly unto his cave there strippd himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recoverd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind rosalind swoons why how now ganymede sweet ganymede many will swoon when they do look on blood there is more in it cousin ganymede look he

sweat say this becomes him as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemishyet must antony no way excuse his soils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness if he filld his

menas how lesser enmities may give way to greater weret not that we stand up against them all twere pregnant they should square between themselves for they have entertained cause enough to draw their

agrippa noble friends that which combined us was most great and let not a leaner action rend us whats amiss may it be gently heard when we debate our trivial difference loud we do commit murder in healing wounds then noble partners the rather for i earnestly beseech touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms nor curstness grow to the matter tis spoken well were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus flourish welcome to rome thank you sit sit sir nay then i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not i must be laughd at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i the world more laughd at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concernd me my being in egypt caesar what wast to you no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question how intend you practised you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befal me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause of this my letters before did satisfy you if youll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patchd up your excuses not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain ont very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o the world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say i could not help it i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience sir he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i the morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have askd him pardon let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with soft caesar no lepidus let him speak the honour is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lackd it but on caesar the article of my oath to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied neglected rather and then when poisond hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge as nearly as i may ill play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case tis noble spoken if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you worthily spoken mecaenas or if you borrow one anothers love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do thou art a soldier only speak no more that truth should be silent i had almost forgot you wrong this presence therefore speak no more go to then your considerate stone i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech fort cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so differing in their acts yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge o the world i would pursue it give me leave caesar speak agrippa thou hast a sister by the mothers side admired octavia great mark antony is now a widower say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness i am not married caesar let me hear agrippa further speak to hold you in perpetual amity to make you brothers and to knit your hearts with an unslipping  knot take antony octavia to his wife whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter by this marriage all little jealousies which now seem great and all great fears which now import their dangers would then be nothing truths would be tales where now half tales be truths her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her pardon what i have spoke for tis a studied not a present thought by duty ruminated will caesar speak not till he hears how antony is touchd with what is spoke already what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good the power of caesar and his power unto octavia may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs there is my hand a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again happily amen i did not think to draw my sword gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him time calls upons of us must pompey presently be sought or else he seeks out us where lies he about the mount misenum what is his strength by land

dolabella thyreus with others let him appear thats come from antony know you him caesar tis his schoolmaster an argument that he is pluckd when hither he sends so poor a pinion off his wing which had superfluous kings for messengers not many moons gone by enter euphronius ambassador from mark antony approach and speak such as i am i come from antony i was of late as petty to his ends as is the morndew on the myrtleleaf to his grand sea bet so declare thine office lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and requires to live in egypt which not granted he lessens his requests and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth a private man in athens this for him next cleopatra does confess thy greatness submits her to thy might and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs now hazarded to thy grace for antony i have no ears to his request the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her alldisgraced friend or take his life there this if she perform she shall not sue unheard so to them both fortune pursue thee bring him through the bands exit euphronius to thyreus from antony win cleopatra promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the neer touchd vestal try thy cunning thyreus make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law caesar i go observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou thinkst his very action speaks in every power that moves caesar i shall exeunt scene xiii alexandria cleopatras palace enter cleopatra domitius enobarbus charmian and iras what shall we do enobarbus think and die is antony or we in fault for this antony only that would make his will lord of his reason what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other why should he follow the itch of his affection should not then have nickd his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the meered question twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing prithee peace enter mark antony with euphronius the ambassador is that his answer ay my lord the queen shall then have courtesy so she will yield us up he says so let her knowt to the boy caesar send this grizzled head and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities that head my lord to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him from which the world should note something particular his coin ships legions may be a cowards whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i the command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay comparisons apart and answer me declined sword against sword ourselves alone ill write it follow me exeunt mark antony and euphronius aside  yes like enough highbattled caesar will unstate his happiness and be staged to the show against a sworder i see mens judgments are a parcel of their fortunes and things outward do draw the inward quality after them to suffer all alike that he should dream knowing all measures the full caesar will answer his emptiness caesar thou hast subdued his judgment too enter an attendant a messenger from caesar what no more ceremony see my women against the blown rose may they stop their nose that kneeld unto the buds admit him sir exit attendant aside  mine honesty and i begin to square the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a falln lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i the story enter thyreus caesars will hear it apart none but friends say boldly so haply are they friends to antony he needs as many sir as caesar has or needs not us if caesar please our master will leap to be his friend for us you know whose he is we are and that is caesars so thus then thou most renownd caesar entreats not to consider in what case thou standst further than he is caesar go on right royal he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love but as you feard him o the scars upon your honour therefore he does pity as constrained

and on the sudden droppd o noble weakness if they had swallowd poison twould appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace here on her breast there is a vent of blood and something blown the like is on her arm this is an aspics trail and these figleaves have slime upon them such as the aspic leaves upon the caves of nile most probable that so she died for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die take up her bed and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous high events as these strike those that make them and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented our army

officers and other attendants proceed solinus to procure my fall and by the doom of death end woes and all merchant of syracuse plead no more i am not partial to infringe our laws the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants our welldealing countrymen who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods excludes all pity from our threatening looks for since the mortal and intestine jars twixt thy seditious countrymen and us it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus he dies his goods confiscate to the dukes dispose unless a thousand marks be levied to quit the penalty and to ransom him thy substance valued at the highest rate cannot amount unto a hundred marks therefore by law thou art condemned to die yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun well syracusian say in brief the cause why thou departedst from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence ill utter what my sorrows give me leave in syracusa was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i lived in joy our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factors death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguishd but by names that very hour and in the selfsame inn a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike thosefor their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we saild before the always windobeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embraced yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinkingripe to us my wife more careful for the latterborn had fastend him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd fastend ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapours that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas waxd calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they cameo let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before nay forward old man do not break off so for we may pity though not pardon thee o had the gods done so i had not now worthily termd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encounterd by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreckd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolongd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befalln of them and thee till now my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendantso his case was like reft of his brother but retaind his name might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labourd of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i loved five summers have i spent in furthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live hapless aegeon whom the fates have markd to bear the extremity of dire mishap now trust me were it not against our laws against my crown my oath my dignity which princes would they may not disannul my soul would sue as advocate for thee but though thou art adjudged to the death and passed sentence may not be recalld but to our honours great disparagement yet i will favour thee in what i can therefore merchant ill limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help try all the friends thou hast in ephesus beg thou or borrow to make up the sum and live if

lost hair of another man antipholus why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit antipholus why but theres many a man hath more hair than wit not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair antipholus why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity antipholus for what reason for two and sound ones too antipholus nay not sound i pray you sure ones then antipholus nay not sure in a thing falsing certain ones then antipholus name them the one to save the money that he spends in trimming the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge antipholus you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things marry and did sir namely no time to recover hair lost by nature antipholus but your reason was not substantial why there

us come in that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery i knew he was not in his perfect wits i am sorry now that i did draw on him how long hath this possession held the man this week he hath been heavy sour sad and much different from the man he was but till this afternoon his passion neer brake into extremity of rage hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea buried some dear friend hath not else his eye strayd his affection in unlawful love a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing which of these sorrows is he subject to to none of these except it be the last namely some love that drew him oft from home you should for that have reprehended him why so i did ay but not rough enough as roughly as my modesty would let me haply in private and in assemblies too ay but not enough it was the copy of our conference in bed he slept not for my urging it at board he fed not for my urging it alone it was the subject of my theme in company i often glanced it still did i tell him it was vile and bad and thereof came it that the man was mad the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dogs tooth it seems his sleeps were hinderd by thy railing and therefore comes it that his head is light thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions thereof the raging fire of fever bred and whats a fever but a fit of madness thou sayst his sports were hinderd by thy brawls sweet recreation barrd what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life in food in sport and lifepreserving rest to be disturbd would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits she never reprehended him but mildly when he demeand himself rough rude and wildly why bear you these rebukes and answer not she did betray me to my own reproof good people enter and lay hold on him no not a creature enters in my house then let your servants bring my husband forth neither he took this place for sanctuary and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again or lose my labour in assaying it i will attend my husband be his nurse diet his sickness for it is my office and will have no attorney but myself and therefore let me have him home with me be patient for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers to make of him a formal man again it is a branch and parcel of mine oath a charitable duty of my order therefore depart and leave him here with me i will not hence and leave my husband here and ill it doth beseem your holiness to separate the husband and the wife be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him exit complain unto the duke of this indignity come go i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess by this i think the dial points at five anon im sure the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale the place of death and sorry execution behind the ditches of the abbey here upon what cause to see a reverend syracusian merchant who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town beheaded publicly for his offence see where they come we will behold his death kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey enter duke solinus attended aegeon bareheaded with the headsman and other officers yet once again proclaim it publicly if any friend will pay the sum for him he shall not die so much we tender him justice most sacred duke against the abbess she is a virtuous and a reverend lady it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong may it please your grace antipholus my husband whom i made lord of me and all i had at your important lettersthis ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him that desperately he hurried through the street with him his bondman all as mad as he doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses bearing thence rings jewels any thing his rage did like once did i get him bound and sent him home whilst to take order for the wrongs i went that here and there his fury had committed anon i wot not by what strong escape he broke from those that had the guard of him and with his mad attendant and himself each one with ireful passion with drawn swords met us again and madly bent on us chased us away till raising of more aid we came again to bind them then they fled into this abbey whither we pursued them and here the abbess shuts the gates on us and will not suffer us to fetch him out nor send him forth that we may bear him hence therefore most gracious duke with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help long since thy husband served me in my wars and i to thee engaged a princes word when thou didst make him master of thy bed to do him all the grace and good i could go some of you knock at the abbeygate and bid the lady abbess come to me i will determine this before i stir enter a servant o mistress mistress shift and save yourself my master and his man are both broke loose beaten the maids arow and bound the doctor whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire and ever as it blazed they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair my master preaches patience to him and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool and sure unless you send some present help between them they will kill the conjurer peace fool thy master and his man are here and that is false thou dost report to us mistress upon my

woman didst thou so no my good lord myself he and my sister today did dine together so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal neer may i look on day nor sleep on night but she tells to your highness simple truth o perjured woman they are both forsworn in this the madman justly chargeth them antipholus my liege i am advised what i say neither disturbed with the effect of wine nor headyrash provoked with raging ire albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad this woman lockd me out this day from dinner that goldsmith there were he not packd with her could witness it for he was with me then who parted with me to go fetch a chain promising to bring it to the porpentine where balthazar and i did dine together our dinner done and he not coming thither i went to seek him in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain which god he knows i saw not for the which he did arrest me with an officer i did obey and sent my peasant home for certain ducats he with none returnd then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house by the way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more of vile confederates along with them they brought one pinch a hungry leanfaced villain a mere anatomy a mountebank a threadbare juggler and a fortuneteller a needy holloweyed sharplooking wretch a deadlooking man this pernicious slave forsooth took on him as a conjurer and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse and with no face as twere outfacing me cries out i was possessd then all together they fell upon me bound me bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man both bound together till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder i gaind my freedom and immediately ran hither to your grace whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities my lord in truth thus far i witness with him that he dined not at home but was lockd out but had he such a chain of thee or no he had my lord and when he ran in here these people saw the chain about his neck besides i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart and thereupon i drew my sword on you and then you fled into this abbey here from whence i think you are come by miracle antipholus i never came within these abbeywalls nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me i never saw the chain so help me heaven and this is false you burden me withal why what an intricate impeach is this i think you all have drunk of circes cup if here you housed him here he would have been if he were mad he would not plead so coldly you say he dined at home the goldsmith here denies that saying sirrah what say you sir he dined with her there at the porpentine he did and from my finger snatchd that ring antipholus tis true my liege this ring i had of her sawst thou him enter at the abbey here

accounted poor citizens the patricians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge would you proceed especially against caius marcius against him first hes a very dog to the commonalty consider you what services he has done for his country very well and could be content to give him good report fort but that he pays himself with being proud nay but speak not maliciously i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though softconscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even till the altitude of his virtue what he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous if i must not i need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition shouts within what shouts are these the other side o the city is risen why stay we prating here to the capitol come come soft who comes here enter menenius agrippa

curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies care for us true indeed they neer cared for us yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and theres all the love they bear us either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale t a little more well ill hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please you deliver there was a time when all the bodys members rebelld against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i the midst o the body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where the other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answerd well sir what answer made the belly sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which neer came from the lungs but even thus for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speakit tauntingly replied to the discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you your bellys answer what the kinglycrowned head the vigilant eye the counsellor heart the arm our soldier our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter with other muniments and petty helps in this our fabric if that they what then fore me this fellow speaks what then what then should by the cormorant belly be restraind who is the sink o the body well what then the former agents if they did complain what could the belly answer i will tell you if youll bestow a smallof what you have little patience awhile youll hear the bellys answer yere long about it note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answerd true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friendsthis says the belly mark me ay sir well well though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran what say you tot it was an answer how apply you this the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o the common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly i the great toe why the great toe for that being one o the lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou gost foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run leadst first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale enter caius marcius hail noble marcius thanks whats the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs we have ever your good word he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland whats the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another whats their seeking for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored hang em they say theyll sit by the fire and presume to know whats done i the capitol whos like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say theres grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword ill make a quarry with thousands of these quarterd slaves as high as i could pick my lance nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop they are dissolved hang em they said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answerd and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look palethey threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o the moon shouting their emulation what is granted them five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice ones junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know notsdeath the rabble should have first unroofd the city ere so prevaild with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrections arguing this is strange go get you home you fragments enter a messenger hastily wheres caius marcius here whats the matter the news is sir the volsces are in arms i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders enter cominius titus lartius and other senators junius brutus and sicinius velutus marcius tis true that you have lately told us the volsces are in arms they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to t i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he you have fought together were half to half the world by the ears and he upon my party ild revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt then worthy marcius attend upon cominius to these wars it is your former promise sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face what art thou stiff standst out no caius marcius ill lean upon one crutch and fight with tother ere stay behind this business o truebred your company to the capitol where i know our greatest friends attend us to cominius                lead you on to marcius right worthy you priority noble marcius to the citizens  hence to your homes be gone nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners your valour puts well forth pray follow citizens steal away exeunt all but sicinius and brutus was ever man so proud as is this marcius he has no equal when we were chosen tribunes for the people markd you his lip and eyes nay but his taunts being moved he will not spare to gird the gods bemock the modest moon the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius fame at the which he aims in whom already hes well graced can not better be held nor more attaind than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the generals fault though he perform to the utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius o if he had borne the business besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius come half all cominius honours are to marcius though marcius earned them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not lets hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action lets along exeunt scene ii corioli the senatehouse enter tullus aufidius and certain senators so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed is it not yours what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words i think i have the letter here yes here it is reads they have pressd a power but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumourd cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither tis bent most likely tis for you consider of it our armys in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veild till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seemd appeard to rome by the discovery we shall be shortend in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot noble aufidius take your commission hie you to your bands let us alone to guard corioli if they set down before s for the remove bring your army but i think youll find theyve not prepared for us o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honours if we and caius marcius chance to meet tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more the gods assist you and keep your honours safe farewell farewell farewell exeunt scene iii rome a room in marcius house enter

you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own o let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i wood in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burnd to bedward flower of warriors how is it with titus lartius as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threatening the other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches where is he call him hither let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common filea plague tribunes for them the mouse neer shunnd the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they but how prevaild you will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o the field if not why cease you till you are so marcius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust as i guess marcius their bands i the vaward are the antiates of their best trust oer them aufidius their very heart of hope i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by the blood we have shed together by the vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action those are they that most are willing if any such be here as it were sin to doubtthat love this painting wherein you see me smeard if any fear

plebeians would the noble marcius hes a lamb indeed that baes like a bear hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you well sir in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance hes poor in no one fault but stored with all especially in pride and topping all others in boasting this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o the righthand file do you why how are we censured because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry well well sir well why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud we do it not alone sir i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could what then sir why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome menenius you are known well enough too i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cant say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too come sir come we know you well enough you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to your worships more of your

home with the oaken garland has he disciplined aufidius soundly titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off and twas time for him too ill warrant him that an he had stayed by him i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold thats in them is the senate possessed of this good ladies lets go yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly in troth theres wondrous things spoke of him wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing the gods grant them true true pow wow true ill be sworn they are true where is he wounded to the tribunes god save your good worships marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i the body one i the neck and two i the thightheres nine that i know he had before this last expedition twentyfive wounds upon him now its twentyseven every gash was an enemys grave a shout and flourish hark the

general and yere welcome all a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root ons heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crabtrees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly ever right menenius ever ever give way there and go on to volumnia and virgilia  your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honours i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only theres one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs on to the capitol flourish cornets exeunt in state as before brutus and sicinius come forward all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram bout her reechy neck clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smotherd up leads filld and ridges horsed with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him seldshown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station or veild dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture on the sudden i warrant him consul then our office may during his power go sleep he cannot temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won in that theres comfort doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to dot i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i the marketplace nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths tis right it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution tis most like he will it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that tos power he would have made them mules silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want if he be put upon t and thats as easy as to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever enter a messenger whats the matter you are sent for to the capitol tis thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he passd the nobles bended as to joves statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like lets to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for the time but hearts for the event have with you exeunt scene ii the same the capitol enter two officers to lay cushions come come they are almost here how many stand for consulships three they say but tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people faith there had been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it no more of him he is a worthy man make way they are coming a sennet enter with actors before them cominius  the consul menenius coriolanus senators  sicinius and brutus the senators take their  places the tribunes take their places by themselves coriolanus stands having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our aftermeeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our wellfound successes to report a little of that worthy work performd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself speak good cominius leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our states defective for requital than we to stretch it out to the tribunes masters o the people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly which the rather we shall be blest to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at thats off thats off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow worthy cominius speak coriolanus offers to go away nay keep your place sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done your horrors pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them sir i hope my words disbenchd you not no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh pray now sit down i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monsterd exit masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utterd feebly it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him be bestrid an oerpressd roman and i the consuls view slew three opposers tarquins self he met and struck him on his knee in that days feats when he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man i the field and for his meed was browbound with the oak his pupil age manenterd thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurchd all swords of the garland for this last before and in corioli let me say i cannot speak him home he stoppd the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obeyd and fell below his stem his sword deaths stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enterd the mortal gate of the city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet now alls his when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit requickend what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking oer the lives of men as if twere a perpetual spoil and till we calld both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting worthy man he cannot but with measure fit the honours which we devise him our spoils he kickd at and lookd upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it hes right noble let him be calld for call coriolanus he doth appear reenter coriolanus the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul i do owe them still my life and services it then remains that you do speak to the people i do beseech you let me oerleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony put them not tot pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form it is apart that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people mark you that to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only do not stand upont we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour to coriolanus come all joy and honour flourish of cornets exeunt all but sicinius and brutus you see how he intends to use the people may they perceives intent he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give come well inform them of our proceedings here on the marketplace i know they do attend us exeunt scene iii the same the forum enter seven or eight citizens once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him we may sir if we will we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o the compass think you so which way do you judge my wit would fly nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans willtis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but if it were at liberty twould sure southward why that way to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the

save thee noble consul exeunt worthy voices reenter menenius with brutus and sicinius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the peoples voice remains that in the official marks invested you anon do meet the senate is this done the custom of request you have discharged the people do admit you and are summond to meet anon upon your approbation where at the senatehouse there coriolanus may i change these garments you may sir that ill straight do and knowing myself again repair to the senatehouse ill keep you company will you along we stay here for the people fare you well exeunt coriolanus and menenius he has it now and by his looks methink tis warm at s heart with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds will you dismiss the people reenter citizens how now my masters have you chose this man he has our voices sir we pray the gods he may deserve your loves amen sir to my poor unworthy notice he mockd us when he beggd our voices certainly he flouted us downright notis his kind of speech he did not mock us not one amongst us save yourself but says he used us scornfully he should have showd us his marks of merit wounds received fors country why so he did i am sure no no no man saw em he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn i would be consul says he aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore when we granted that here was i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices i have no further with you was not this mockery why either were you ignorant to seet or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices could you not have told him as you were lessond when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i the body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o the state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord thus to have said as you were foreadvised had touchd his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluckd either his gracious promise which you might as cause had calld you up have held him to or else it would have galld his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have taen the advantage of his choler and passd him unelected did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your suedfor tongues hes not confirmd we may deny him yet and will deny him ill have five hundred voices of that sound i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scornd you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you the apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you lay a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us ay spare us not say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o the marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numas daughters son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our beat water brought by conduits hither and  censorinus  nobly named so twice being  by the people chosen  censor was his great ancestor one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that hes your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation say you neer had donet harp on that stillbut by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to the capitol we will so almost all repent in their election exeunt citizens let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger to the capitol come we will be there before the stream o the people and this shall seem as partly tis their own which we have goaded onward exeunt act iii scene i rome a street cornets enter coriolanus menenius all the gentry cominius titus lartius and other senators tullus aufidius then had made new head he had my lord and that it was which caused our swifter composition so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upons again they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again saw you aufidius on safeguard he  came to me and did curse against the volsces for they had so vilely yielded the town he is retired to antium spoke he of me he did my lord how what how often he had met you sword to sword that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution so he might be calld your vanquisher at antium lives he at antium i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home enter sicinius and brutus behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance pass no further ha what is that it will be dangerous to go on no further what makes this change the matter hath he not passd the noble and the common cominius no have i had childrens voices tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace the people are incensed against him stop or all will fall in broil are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on be calm be calm it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffert and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled callt not a plot the people cry you mockd them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repined scandald the suppliants for the people calld them timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness why this was known before not to them all have you informd them sithence how i inform them you are like to do such business not unlike each way to better yours why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune lets be calm the people are abused set on this paltering becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonourd rub laid falsely i the plain way of his merit tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speakt again not now not now not in this heat sir now now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rankscented many let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have ploughd for sowd and scatterd by mingling them with us the honourd number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars well no more no more words we beseech you how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tatter us yet sought the very way to catch them you speak o the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity twere well we let the people knowt what what his choler choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove twould be my mind it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall twas from the canon shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o the monsters wants not spirit to say hell turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learnd be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the greatst taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frown in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other well on to the marketplace whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used sometime in greece well well no more of that though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourishd disobedience fed the ruin of the state why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice ill give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured that neer did service fort being pressd to the war even when the navel of the state was touchd they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i the war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showd most valour spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the motive of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bisson multitude digest the senates courtesy let deeds express whats like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles come enough enough with overmeasure no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignoranceit must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barrd it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change ont that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic thats sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should becomet not having the power to do the good it would for the in which doth controlt has said enough has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion when whats not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i the dust manifest treason this a consul no the aediles ho enter an aedile

have named for consul fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench to unbuild the city and to lay all flat what is the city but the people true the people are the city by the consent of all we were establishd the peoples magistrates you so remain and so are like to do that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin this deserves death or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it we do here pronounce upon the part o the people in whose power we were elected theirs marcius is worthy of present death therefore lay hold of him bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him aediles seize him yield marcius yield hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word peace peace to brutus  be that you seem truly your countrys friend and temperately proceed to what you would thus violently redress sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very

must be patchd with cloth of any colour nay come away exeunt coriolanus cominius and others this man has marrd his fortune his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove fors power to thunder his hearts his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death a noise within heres goodly work i would they were abed i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak em fair reenter brutus and sicinius with the rabble where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself you worthy tribunes he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought he shall well know the noble tribunes are the peoples mouths and we their hands he shall sure ont sir sir peace do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant sir how comest that you have holp to make this rescue hear me speak as i do know the consuls worthiness so can i name his faults consul what consul the consul coriolanus he consul no no no no no if by the tribunes leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies tonight now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enrolld in joves own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own hes a disease that must be cut away o hes a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome thats worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ouncehe droppd it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that dot and suffer it a brand to the end o the world this is clean kam merely awry when he did love his country it honourd him the service of the foot being once gangrened is not then respected for what before it was well hear no more pursue him to his house and pluck him thence lest his infection being of catching nature spread further one word more one word this tigerfooted rage when it shall find the harm of unscannd swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds tos heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans if it were so what do ye talk have we not had a taste of his obedience our aediles smote ourselves resisted come consider this he has been bred i the wars since he could draw a sword and is ill schoold in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave ill go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril noble tribunes it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning noble menenius be you then as the peoples officer masters lay down your weapons go not home meet on the marketplace well attend you there where if you bring not marcius well proceed in our first way ill bring him to you to the senators let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow pray you lets to him exeunt scene ii a room in coriolanuss house enter coriolanus with patricians let them puff all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them you do the nobler i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war enter volumnia i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out let go you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not showd them how ye were disposed ere they lackd power to cross you let them hang ay and burn too enter menenius and senators come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it theres no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish pray be counselld i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to the herd but that the violent fit o the time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear what must i do return to the tribunes well what then what then repent what you have spoke for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then dot to them you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unseverd friends i the war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by the other lose that they combine not there tush tush a good demand if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request why force you this because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosoms truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretchd ithere be with them thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the earswaving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being askd as free as words to little purpose prithee now go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower here is cominius enter cominius i have been i the marketplace and sirtis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence alls in anger only fair speech i think twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit he must and will prithee now say you will and go about it must i go show them my unbarbed sconce must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will dot yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throwt against the wind to the marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life come come well prompt you i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before well i must dot away my disposition and possess me some harlots spirit my throat of war be turnd which quired with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggars tongue make motion through my lips and my armd knees who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not dot lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my bodys action teach my mind a most inherent baseness at thy choice then to beg of thee it is my more dishonour than thou of them come all to ruin let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me but owe thy pride thyself pray be content mother i am going to the marketplace chide me no more ill mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife ill return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i the way of flattery further do your will exit away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepared with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour ay but mildly well mildly be it then mildly exeunt scene iii the same the forum enter sicinius and brutus in this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people and that the spoil got on the antiates was neer distributed enter an aedile what will he come hes coming how accompanied with old menenius and those senators that always favourd him have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll i have tis ready have you collected them by tribes i have assemble presently the people hither and when they bear me say it shall be so i the right and strength o the commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry fine if death cry death insisting on the old prerogative and power i the truth o the cause i shall inform them and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence very well make them be strong and ready for this hint when we shall hap to give t them go about it exit aedile put him to choler straight he hath been used ever to conquer and to have his worth of contradiction being once chafed he cannot be reind again to temperance then he speaks whats in his heart and that is there which looks with us to break his neck well here he comes enter coriolanus menenius and cominius with senators and patricians calmly i do beseech you ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece will bear the knave by the volume the honourd gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among s throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war amen amen a noble wish reenter aedile with citizens draw near ye people list to your tribunes audience peace i say first hear me speak well say peace ho shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here i do demand if you submit you to the peoples voices allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you i am content lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i the holy churchyard scratches with briers scars to move laughter only consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you well well no more what is the matter that being passd for consul with full voice i am so dishonourd that the very hour you take it off again answer to us say then tis true i ought so we charge you that you have contrived to take from rome all seasond office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people how traitor nay temperately your promise the fires i the lowest hell foldin the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hand clutchd as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods mark you this people to the rock to the rock with him peace we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves the extremest death but since he hath served well for rome what do you prate of service i talk of that that know it you is this the promise that you made your mother know i pray you i know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile raying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor cheque my courage for what they can give to havet with saying good morrow for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it in the name o the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i the peoples name i say it shall be so it shall be so it shall be so let him away hes banishd and it shall be so hear me my masters and my common friends hes sentenced no more hearing let me speak i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies marks upon me i do love my countrys good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wifes estimate her wombs increase and treasure of my loins then if i would speak that we know your drift speak what theres no more to be said but he is banishd as enemy to the people and his country it shall be so it shall be so it shall be so you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumour shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making not reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows despising for you the city thus i turn my back there is a world elsewhere exeunt coriolanus cominius menenius senators and patricians the peoples enemy is gone is gone our enemy is banishd he is gone hoo hoo shouting and throwing up their caps go see him out at gates and follow him as he hath followed you with all despite give him deserved vexation let a guard attend us through the city come come lets see him out at gates come the gods preserve our noble tribunes come exeunt act iv scene i rome before a gate of the city enter coriolanus volumnia virgilia menenius cominius with the young nobility of rome come leave your tears a brief farewell the beast

speakst not speak man whats thy name if tullus unmuffling not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself what is thy name a name unmusical to the volscians ears and harsh in sound to thine say whats thy name thou hast a grim appearance and thy face bears a command int though thy tackles torn thou showst a noble vessel whats thy name prepare thy brow to frown knowst thou me yet i know thee not thy name my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devourd the rest and sufferd me by the voice of slaves to be whoopd out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope mistake me notto save my life for if i had feard death of all the men i the world i would have voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cankerd country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes thourt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followd thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service o marcius marcius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say tis true ild not believe them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarrd the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i loved the maid i married never man sighd truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each others throat and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banishd we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood oerbear o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself you bless me gods therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take the one half of my commission and set down as best thou art experienced since thou knowst thy countrys strength and weaknessthine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than eer an enemy yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two servingmen come forward heres a strange alteration by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him what an arm he has he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top nay i knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methoughti cannot tell how to term it he had so looking as it werewould i were hanged but i thought there was more in him than i could think so did i ill be sworn he is simply the rarest man i the world i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on who my master nay its no matter for that worth six on him nay not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier faith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent ay and for an assault too reenter third servingman o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals what what what lets partake i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lieve be a condemned man wherefore wherefore why heres he that was wont to thwack our general caius marcius why do you say thwack our general  i do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him come we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself he was too hard for him directly to say the troth ont before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado an he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too but more of thy news why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself withs hand and turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table hell go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled and hes as like to dot as any man i can imagine dot he will dot for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst hes in directitude directitude whats that but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel all with him but when goes this forward tomorrow today presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips why then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed balladmakers let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night its spritely waking audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than wars a destroyer of men tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds ay and it makes men hate one another reason because they then less need one another the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians they are rising they are rising in in in in exeunt scene vi rome a public place enter sicinius and brutus we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer byt behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly we stood tot in good time enter menenius is this menenius tis hetis he o he is grown most kind of late hail sir hail to you both your coriolanus is not much missd but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it alls well and might have been much better if he could have temporized where is he hear you nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him enter three or four citizens the gods preserve you both godden our neighbours godden to you all godden to you all ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both live and thrive farewell kind neighbours we wishd coriolanus had loved you as we did now the gods keep you farewell farewell exeunt citizens this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion caius marcius was a worthy officer i the war but insolent oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking selfloving and affecting one sole throne without assistance i think not so we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him enter an aedile worthy tribunes there is a slave whom we have put in prison reports the volsces with two several powers are enterd in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before em tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out come what talk you of marcius go see this rumourer whippd it cannot be the volsces dare break with us cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like have been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded tell not me i know this cannot be not possible enter a messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senatehouse some news is come that turns their countenances tis this slave go whip him fore the peoples eyeshis raising nothing but his report yes worthy sir the slaves report is seconded and more more fearful is deliverd what more fearful it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not knowthat marcius joind with aufidius leads a power gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngst and oldest thing this is most likely raised only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again the very trick ont this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety enter a second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already oerborne their way consumed with fire and took what lay before them enter cominius o you have made good work what news what news you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonourd to your noses whats the news whats the news your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confined into an augers bore pray now your news you have made fair work i fear mepray your news if marcius should be joind with volscians if he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies you have made good work you and your apronmen you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of garliceaters he will shake your rome about your ears as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work but is this true sir ay and youll look pale before you find it other all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resist are mockd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools who ist can blame him your enemies and his find something in him we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy who shall ask it the tribunes cannot dot for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say be good to rome they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate and therein showd like enemies tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never so incapable of help say not we brought it how was it we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o the city but i fear theyll roar him in again tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them enter a troop of citizens here come the clusters and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus exile now hes coming and not a hair upon a soldiers head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it faith we hear fearful news for mine own part when i said banish him i said twas pity and so did i and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will ye re goodly things you voices you have made good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol o ay what else exeunt cominius and menenius go masters get you home be not dismayd these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear the gods be good to us come masters lets home i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished him so did we all but come lets home exeunt citizens i do not like this news nor i lets to the capitol would half my wealth would buy this for a lie pray let us go exeunt scene vii a camp at a small distance from rome enter aufidius and his lieutenant do they still fly to the roman i do not know what witchcrafts in him but your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat their talk at table and their thanks at end and you are darkend in this action sir even by your own i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in thats no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended yet i wish sir i mean for your particularyou had not joind in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself or else to him had left it solely i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine wheneer we come to our account sir i beseech you think you hell carry rome all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think hell be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even whether twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controlld the war but one of these as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free himmade him feard so hated and so banishd but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come lets away when caius rome is thine thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine exeunt act v scene i rome a public place enter menenius cominius sicinius brutus and others no ill not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he calld me father but what o that go you that banishd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyd to hear cominius speak ill keep at home he would not seem to know me do you hear yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forged himself a name o the fire of burning rome why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have rackd for rome to make coals cheapa noble memory i minded him how royal twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punishd very well could he say less i offerd to awaken his regard fors private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose the offence for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so neverneeded help yet do not upbraids with our distress but sure if you would be your countrys pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman no ill not meddle pray you go to him what should i do only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius well and say that marcius return me as cominius is returnd unheard what then but as a discontented friend griefshot with his unkindness sayt be so yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well ill undertake t i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffd these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore ill watch him till he be dieted to my request and then ill set upon him you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way good faith ill prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success exit hell never hear him not i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him twas very faintly he said rise dismissd me thus with his speechless hand what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country therefore lets hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on exeunt scene ii entrance of the volscian camp before rome two sentinels on guard enter to them menenius stay whence are you stand and go back you guard like men tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus from whence from rome you may not pass you must return our general will no more hear from thence youll see your rome embraced with fire before youll speak with coriolanus good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touchd your ears it is menenius be it so go back the virtue of your name is not here passable i tell thee fellow the general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his name unparalleld haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom hes chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stampd the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely therefore go back prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have i am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass therefore go back has he dined canst thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner you are a roman are you i am as thy general is then you should hate rome as he does can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this no you are deceived therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation come my captain knows you not i mean thy general my general cares not for you back i say go lest i let forth your halfpint of blood backthats the utmost of your having back nay but fellow fellow enter coriolanus and aufidius whats the matter now you companion ill say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee to coriolanus the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet herethis who like a block hath denied my access to thee away how away wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore be gone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i loved thee take this along i writ it for thy sake gives a letter and would have rent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my beloved in rome yet thou beholdst you keep a constant temper exeunt coriolanus and aufidius now sir is your name menenius tis a spell you see of much  power you know the way home again do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back what cause do you think i have to swoon i neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think theres any yere so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away exit a noble fellow i warrant him the worthy fellow is our general hes the rock the oak not to be windshaken exeunt scene iii the tent of coriolanus enter coriolanus aufidius and others we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to the volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business only their ends you have respected stoppd your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper no not with such friends that thought them sure of you this last old man whom with a crackd heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have though i showd sourly to him once more offerd the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to ha what shout is this shout within shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time tis made i will not enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia leading young marcius valeria and attendants my wife comes foremost then the honourd mould wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy ill never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin my lord and husband these eyes are not the same i wore in rome the sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgind it eer since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i the earth kneels of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons o stand up blest whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent kneels what is this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun murdering impossibility to make what cannot be slight work thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee do you know this lady the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle thats curdied by the frost from

to this end he bowd his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free sir his stoutness when he did stand for consul which he lost by lack of stooping that i would have spoke of being banishd fort he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him jointservant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seemd his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary so he did my lord the army marvelld at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we lookd for no less spoil than glory there was it for which my sinews shall be stretchd upon him at a few drops of womens rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die and ill renew me in his fall but hark drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of the people your native town you enterd like a post and had no welcomes home but he returns splitting the air with noise and patient fools whose children he hath slain their base throats tear with giving him glory therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let

that most desired the match but not a courtier although they wear their faces to the bent of the kings looks hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at and why so he that hath missd the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her i mean that married her alack good man and therefore banishdis a creature such as to seek through the regions of the earth for one his

for so long as he could make me with this eye or ear distinguish him from others he did keep the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief still waving as the fits and stirs of s mind could best express how slow his soul saild on how swift his ship thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to aftereye him madam so i did i would have broke mine eyestrings crackd them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followd him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turnd mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him be assured madam with his next vantage i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour or have charged him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight to encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all

enter philario iachimo a frenchman a dutchman and a spaniard believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but i could then have looked on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items you speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within i have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he this matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter and then his banishment ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality but how comes it he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintance his father and i were soldiers together to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality enter posthumus leonatus i beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing sir we have known together in orleans since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still sir you oerrate my poor kindness i was glad i did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others experiences but upon my mended judgmentif i offend not to say it is mendedmy quarrel was not altogether slight faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fallen both can we with manners ask what was the difference safely i think twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouchingand upon warrant of bloody affirmationhis to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constantqualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france that lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this worn out she holds her virtue still and i my mind you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy being so far provoked as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend as fair and as gooda kind of handinhand comparisonhad been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone what do you esteem it at more than the world enjoys either your unparagoned mistress is dead or shes outprized by a trifle you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods which the gods have given you which by their graces i will keep you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring let us leave here gentlemen sir with all my heart this worthy signior i thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend no no i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion oervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world you are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what youre worthy of by your attempt whats that a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted would i had put my estate and my neighbours on the approbation of what i have spoke what lady would you choose to assail yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger tis part of it you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope i am the master of my speeches and would undergo whats spoken i swear will you i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn betweens my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match heres my ring i will have it no lay by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevailed i am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduced you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword your hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded agreed exeunt posthumus leonatus and iachimo will this hold

caius lucius and attendants now say what would augustus caesar with us when julius caesar whose remembrance yet lives in mens eyes and will to ears and tongues be theme and hearing ever was in this britain and conquerd it cassibelan thine uncle famous in caesars praises no whit less than in his feats deserving itfor him and his succession granted rome a tribute yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately is left untenderd and to kill the marvel shall be so ever there be many caesars ere such another julius britain is a world by itself and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses that opportunity which then they had to take from s to resume we have again remember sir my liege the kings your ancestors together with the natural bravery of your isle which stands as neptunes park ribbed and paled in with rocks unscalable and roaring waters with sands that will not bear your enemies boats but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest caesar made here but made not here his brag of came and saw and overcame  with shame that first that ever touchd himhe was carried from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping poor ignorant baubles upon our terrible seas like eggshells moved upon their surges crackd as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof the famed cassibelan who was once at point o giglot fortuneto master caesars sword made luds town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage come theres no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as i said there is no moe such caesars other of them may have crookd noses but to owe such straight arms none son let your mother end we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as cassibelan i do not say i am one but i have a hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now you must know till the injurious romans did extort this tribute from us we were free caesars ambition which swelld so much that it did almost stretch the sides o the world against all colour here did put the yoke upon s which to shake off becomes a warlike people whom we reckon ourselves to be we do say then to caesar our ancestor was that mulmutius which ordaind our laws whose use the sword of caesar hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise shall by the power we hold be our good deed though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws who was the first of britain which did put his brows within a golden crown and calld himself a king i am sorry cymbeline that i am to pronounce augustus caesar caesar that hath more kings his servants than thyself domestic officersthine enemy receive it from me then war and confusion in caesars name pronounce i gainst thee look for fury not to be resisted thus defied i thank thee for myself thou art welcome caius thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent much under him of him i gatherd honour which he to seek of me again perforce behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect that the pannonians and dalmatians for their liberties are now in arms a precedent which not to read would show the britons cold so caesar shall not find them let proof speak his majesty bids you welcome make pastime with us a day or two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our saltwater girdle if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and theres an end so sir i know your masters pleasure and he

seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty thou leonatus art the lions whelp the fit and apt construction of thy name being leonatus doth import so much to cymbeline the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter which we call mollis aer and mollis aer we term it mulier which mulier i divine is this most constant wife who even now answering the letter of the oracle unknown to you unsought were clippd about with this most tender air this hath some seeming the lofty cedar royal cymbeline personates thee and thy loppd branches point thy two

although the victor we submit to caesar and to the roman empire promising to pay our wonted tribute from the which we were dissuaded by our wicked queen whom heavens in justice both on her and hers have laid most heavy hand the fingers of the powers above do tune the harmony of this peace the vision which i made known to lucius ere the stroke of this yet scarcecold battle at this instant is full accomplishd for the roman eagle from south to west on wing soaring aloft lessend herself and in the beams o the sun so vanishd which foreshowd our princely eagle the imperial caesar should again unite his favour with the radiant cymbeline which shines here in the west laud we the gods and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils from our blest altars publish we this peace to all our subjects set we forward let a roman and a british ensign wave friendly together so through ludstown march and in the temple of great jupiter our peace well ratify seal it with feasts set on there never was a war did cease ere bloody hands were washd with such a peace exeunt act i scene i elsinore a platform before the castle francisco at his post enter to him bernardo whos there nay answer me stand and unfold yourself long live the king bernardo he you come most carefully upon your hour tis now struck twelve get thee to bed francisco for this relief much thanks tis bitter cold and i am sick at heart have you had quiet guard not a mouse stirring well good night if you do meet horatio and marcellus the rivals of my watch bid them make haste i think i hear them stand ho whos there enter horatio and marcellus friends to this ground and liegemen to the dane give you good night o farewell honest soldier who hath relieved you bernardo has my place give you good night exit holla bernardo say what is horatio there a piece of him welcome horatio welcome good marcellus what has this thing appeard again tonight i have seen nothing horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it tush tush twill not appear sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen well sit we down and let us hear bernardo speak of this last night of all when yond same star thats westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one enter ghost peace break thee off look where it comes again in the same figure like the king thats dead thou art a scholar speak to it horatio looks it not like the king  mark it horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder it would be spoke to question it horatio what art thou that usurpst this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak it is offended see it stalks away stay speak speak i charge thee speak exit ghost tis gone and will not answer how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you ont before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes is it not like the king as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frownd he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night jointlabourer with the day who ist that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appeard to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach int which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and romage in the land i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the minds eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptunes empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen but soft behold lo where it comes again reenter ghost ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me cock crows if thou art privy to thy countrys fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here tis gone exit ghost we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty lets dot i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene ii a room of state in the castle enter king claudius queen gertrude hamlet  polonius laertes voltimand cornelius lords and attendants though yet of hamlet our dear brothers death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen the imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barrd your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brothers death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with the dream of his advantage he hath not faild to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephews purposeto suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltimand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these delated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltimand and cornelius and now laertes whats the news with you you told us of some suit what ist laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes my dread lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your fathers leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seald my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside  a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou knowst tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forced breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected havior of the visage together with all forms moods shapes of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the kings rouse the heavens all bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fixd his canon gainst selfslaughter o god god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followd my poor fathers body like niobe all tearswhy she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mournd longermarried with my uncle my fathers brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and bernardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatioor i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend ill change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do mine ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore well teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your fathers funeral i pray thee do not mock me fellowstudent i think it was to see my mothers wedding indeed my lord it followd hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my fathermethinks i see my father where my lord in my minds eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for awhile with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for gods love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounterd a figure like your father armed at point exactly capape appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes within his truncheons length whilst they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliverd both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watchd did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanishd from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honourd lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight we do my lord armd say you armd my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what lookd he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fixd his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amazed you very like very like stayd it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred longer longer not when i sawt his beard was grizzledno it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silverd i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant it will if it assume my noble fathers person ill speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceald this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare you well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve ill visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt all but hamlet my fathers spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes exit scene iii a room in polonius house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embarkd farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighd his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalued persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmasterd importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles like a puffd and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayd for there my blessing with thee and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each newhatchd unfledged comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in beart that the opposed may beware of thee give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine ownself be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lockd and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what ist ophelia be hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry ill teach you think yourself a baby that you have taen these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thusyoull tender me a fool my lord he hath importuned me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is amaking you must not take for fire from this time be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look tot i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene iv the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry ist but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honourd in the breach than the observance this heavyheaded revel east and west makes us traduced and taxd of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performd at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birthwherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the oergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much oerleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being natures livery or

thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter barkd about most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brothers hand of life of crown of

so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir heres my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soild i the working mark you your party in

upon his head his stockings fould ungarterd and downgyved to his ancle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrorshe comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his fetters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene ii a room in the castle enter king claudius queen gertrude rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome

impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give the assay of arms

hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she received his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told mewhat might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had playd the desk or tablebook or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or lookd upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulseda short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a timeid fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it proved otherwise not that i know pointing to his head and shoulder take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know

aside  how say you by that still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this ill speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside  though this be madness yet there is method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughtermy honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius  god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not overhappy on fortunes cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet whats the news none my lord but that the worlds grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmarks a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we to the court for by my fay i cannot reason well wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why any thing but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no aside to guildenstern  what say you aside  nay then i have an eye of youif you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of latebut wherefore i know notlost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort what players are they even those you were wont to take delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed are they not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aery of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common playersas it is most like if their means are no bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question ist possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty an hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb

taste of your quality come a passionate speech what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it wasas i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast it is not soit begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lords murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus oersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matchd pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemd i the air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new awork and never did the cyclops hammers fall on marss armour forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends this is too long it shall to the barbers with your beard prithee say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba but who o who had seen the mobled queen the mobled queen thats good mobled queen is good run barefoot up and down threatening the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all oerteemed loins a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd gainst fortunes state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look whether he has not turned his colour and has tears ins eyes pray you no more tis well ill have thee speak out the rest soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according

peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wannd tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddymettled rascal peak like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damnd defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murderd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall acursing like a very drab a scullion fie upont foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimd their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ ill have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his looks ill tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me ill have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king claudius queen gertrude polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we oerraught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlets wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen gertrude ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much provedthat with devotions visage and pious action we do sugar oer the devil himself aside          o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord exeunt king claudius and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of despised love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of actionsoft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins rememberd good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to redeliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you

poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery wheres your father at home my lord let the doors

his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this somethingsettled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you ont it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and ill be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatchd go exeunt scene ii a hall in the castle enter hamlet and players speak

your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special oerstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern how now my

validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion

brought them exeunt scene vii another room in the castle enter king claudius and laertes now must your conscience my acquaintance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so crimeful and so capital in nature as by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirrd up o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine enter a messenger how now what news letters my lord from hamlet this to your majesty this to the queen from hamlet who brought them sailors my lord they say i saw them not they were given me by claudio he received them of him that brought them laertes you shall hear them leave us exit messenger reads high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return                  hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing know you the hand tis hamlets character naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me im lost in it my lord but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus didest thou if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me ay my lord so you will not oerrule me to a peace to thine own peace if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practise and call it accident my lord i will be ruled the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ it falls right you have been talkd of since your travel much and that in hamlets hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege what part is that my lord a very riband in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy ive seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as he had been incorpsed and deminatured with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did a norman wast a norman upon my life lamond the very same i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with him now out of this what out of this my lord laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart why ask you this not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words to cut his throat i the church no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returnd shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practise requite him for your father i will dot and for that purpose ill anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratchd withal ill touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assayd therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this should blast in proof soft let me see well make a solemn wager on your cunnings i hat when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink ill have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomd stuck our purpose may hold there enter queen gertrude how now sweet queen one woe doth tread upon anothers heel so fast they follow your sisters drownd laertes drownd o where there is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream there with fantastic garlands did she come of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name but our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide and mermaidlike awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old tunes as one incapable of her own distress or like a creature native and indued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments heavy with their drink pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death alas then she is drownd drownd drownd too much of water hast thou poor ophelia and therefore i forbid my tears but yet it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say what it will when these are gone the woman will be

smelt so pah puts down the skull een so my lord to what base uses we may return horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole twere to consider too curiously to consider so no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel imperious caesar dead and turnd to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw but soft but soft aside here comes the king enter priest  and c in procession the corpse of  ophelia laertes

enter hamlet and horatio so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance remember it my lord sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometimes serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us theres a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will that is most certain up from my cabin my seagown scarfd about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unseal their grand commission where i found horatio o royal knaveryan exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmarks health and englands too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the axe my head should be struck off ist possible heres the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed i beseech you being thus benetted round with villanies ere i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the playi sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labourd much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeomans service wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote ay good my lord an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many suchlike ases of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shrivingtime allowd how was this seald why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my fathers signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in form of the other subscribed it gavet the impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our seafight and what to this was sequent thou knowst already so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites why what a king is this does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon he that hath killd my king and whored my mother poppd in between the election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenageist not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and ist not to be damnd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there it will be short the interim is mine and a mans lifes no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his ill court his favours but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion peace who comes here enter osric your lordship is right welcome back to denmark i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly no my good lord thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head i thank your lordship it is very hot no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly it is indifferent cold my lord indeed but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas twerei cannot tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter i beseech you remember hamlet moves him to put on his hat nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more your lordship speaks most infallibly of him the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath sir ist not possible to understand in another tongue you will dot sir really what imports the nomination of this gentleman of laertes his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent of him sir i know you are not ignorant i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowed whats his weapon rapier and dagger thats two of his weapons but well the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary horses against the which he has imponed as i take it six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit what call you the carriages i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done the carriages sir are the hangers the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberalconceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish why is this imponed as you call it the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer how if i answer no i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits shall i redeliver you een so to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will i commend my duty to your lordship yours yours exit osric he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else fors turn this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head he did comply with his dug before he sucked it thus has heand many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out enter a lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time i am constant to my purpose they follow the kings pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now the king and queen and all are coming down in happy time the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play she well instructs me exit lord you will lose this wager my lord i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practise i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter nay good my lord it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what ist to leave betimes enter king claudius queen gertrude laertes lords osric and attendants with foils  and c come hamlet

madness is poor hamlets enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot mine arrow oer the house and hurt my brother i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honour i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored but till that time i do receive your offerd love like love and will not wrong it i embrace it freely and will this brothers wager frankly play give

if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story march afar off and shot within what warlike noise is this young fortinbras with conquest come from poland to the ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley o i die horatio the potent poison quite oercrows my spirit i cannot live to hear the news from england but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras he has my dying voice so tell him with the occurrents more and less which have solicited the rest is silence dies now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither march within enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others where is this sight what is it ye would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search this quarry cries on havoc o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfilld that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook falln on the inventors reads all this can i truly deliver let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performd even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royally and for his passage the soldiers music and the rites of war speak loudly for him take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss go bid the soldiers shoot a dead march exeunt bearing off the dead bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off act i prologue enter chorus o for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention a kingdom for a stage princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene then should the warlike harry like himself assume the port of mars and at his heels leashd in like hounds should famine sword and fire crouch for employment but pardon and gentles all the flat unraised spirits that have dared on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth so great an object can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of france or may we cram within this wooden o the very casques that did affright the air at agincourt o pardon since a crooked figure may attest in little place a million and let us ciphers to this great accompt on your imaginary forces work suppose within the girdle of these walls are now confined two mighty monarchies whose high upreared and abutting fronts the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder piece out our imperfections with your thoughts into a thousand parts divide on man and make imaginary puissance think when we talk of horses that you see them printing their proud hoofs i the receiving earth for tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings carry them here and there jumping oer times turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass for the which supply admit me chorus to this history who prologuelike your humble patience pray gently to hear kindly to judge our play exit scene i london an antechamber in the kings palace enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely my lord ill tell you that self bill is urged which in the eleventh year of the last kings reign was like and had indeed against us passd but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question but how my lord shall we resist it now it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valued thus as much as would maintain to the kings honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill this would drink deep twould drink the cup and all but what prevention the king is full of grace and fair regard and a true lover of the holy church the courses of his youth promised it not the breath no sooner left his fathers body but that his wildness mortified in him seemd to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whippd the offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise to envelop and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydraheaded wilfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king we are blessed in the change hear him but reason in divinity and alladmiring with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle renderd you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a charterd libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears to steal his sweet and honeyd sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unletterd rude and shallow his hours filld up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighbourd by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscured his contemplation under the veil of wildness which no doubt grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the commons doth his majesty incline to it or no he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing the exhibiters against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opend to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal how did this offer seem received my lord with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his greatgrandfather what was the impediment that broke this off the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four oclock it is then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it ill wait upon you and i long to hear it exeunt scene ii the same the presence chamber enter king henry v gloucester bedford exeter warwick westmoreland and attendants where is my gracious lord of canterbury not here in presence send for him good uncle shall we call in the ambassador my liege not yet my cousin we would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it sure we thank you my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salique that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords that make such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washd as pure as sin with baptism then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdued the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establishd then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany calld meisen then doth it well appear that salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposed the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twentysix and charles the great subdued the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conveyd himself as heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summers sun king pepins title and hugh capets claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurpd from you and your progenitors may i with right and conscience make this claim the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for your own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your greatgrandsires tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your greatuncles edward the black prince who on the french ground playd a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lions whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege is in the very maymorn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie paviliond in the fields of france o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors we must not only arm to invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my greatgrandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnishd kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fulness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girding with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood she hath been then more feard than harmd my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edwards fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries but theres a saying very old and true if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crushd necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves while that the armed hand doth fight abroad the advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honeybees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summers velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tentroyal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sadeyed justice with his surly hum delivering oer to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dials centre so may a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy call in the messengers sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendants now are we well resolved and by gods help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours well bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces or there well sit ruling in large and ample empery oer france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshippd with a waxen epitaph enter ambassadors of france now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king mayt please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphins meaning and our embassy we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fetterd in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphins mind thus then in few your highness lately sending into france did claim some certain dukedoms in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third in answer of which claim the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth and bids you be advised theres nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won you cannot revel into dukedoms there he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you this the dauphin speaks what treasure uncle tennisballs my liege we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us his present and your pains we thank you for when we have marchd our rackets to these balls we will in france by gods grace play a set shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturbd with chaces and we understand him well how he comes oer us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them we never valued this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for workingdays but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turnd his balls to gunstones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphins scorn but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a wellhallowd cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassadors this was a merry message we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before well chide this dauphin at his fathers door therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt flourish act ii prologue enter chorus now all the youth of

hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us never was monarch better feard and loved than is your majesty theres not i think a subject that sits in heartgrief and uneasiness under the sweet shade of your government true those that were your fathers enemies have steepd their galls in honey and do serve you with hearts create of duty and of zeal we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness so service shall with steeled sinews toil and labour shall refresh itself with hope to do your grace incessant services we judge no less uncle of exeter enlarge the man committed yesterday that raild against our person we consider it was excess of wine that set him on and on his more advice we pardon him thats mercy but too much security let him be punishd sovereign lest example breed by his sufferance more of such a kind o let us yet be merciful so may your highness and yet punish too sir you show great mercy if you give him life after the taste of much correction alas your too much love

late commissioners i one my lord your highness bade me ask for it today so did you me my liege and i my royal sovereign then richard earl of cambridge there is yours there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight grey of northumberland this same is yours read them and know i know your worthiness my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter we will aboard to night why how now gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion look ye how they change their cheeks are paper why what read you there that hath so cowarded and chased your blood out of appearance i do confess my fault and do submit me to your highness mercy to which we all appeal the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressd and killd you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy for your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you see you my princes and my noble peers these english monsters my lord of cambridge here you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with all appertinents belonging to his honour and this man hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired and sworn unto the practises of france to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel ingrateful savage and inhuman creature thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels that knewst the very bottom of my soul that almost mightst have coind me into gold wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it treason and murder ever kept together as two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence all other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colours and with forms being fetchd from glistering semblances of piety but he that temperd thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor if that same demon that hath gulld thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions i can never win a soul so easy as that englishmans o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful why so didst thou seem they grave and learned why so didst thou come they of noble family why so didst thou seem they religious why so didst thou or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnishd and deckd in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in purged judgment trusting neither such and so finely bolted didst thou seem and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the fullfraught man and best indued with some suspicion i will weep for thee for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man their faults are open arrest them to the answer of the law and god acquit them of their practises i arrest thee of high treason by the name of richard earl of cambridge i arrest thee of high treason by the name of henry lord scroop of masham i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas grey knight of northumberland our purposes god justly hath discoverd and i repent my fault more than my death which i beseech your highness to forgive although my body pay the price of it for me the gold of france did not seduce although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended but god be thanked for prevention which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice beseeching god and you to pardon me never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy oer myself prevented from a damned enterprise my fault but not my body pardon sovereign god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspired against our royal person joind with an enemy proclaimd and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdoms safety must so tender whose ruin you have sought that to her laws we do deliver you get you therefore hence poor miserable

yes that a did and said they were devils incarnate a could never abide carnation twas a colour he never liked a said once the devil would have him about women a did in some sort indeed handle women

fields my most redoubted father it is most meet we arm us gainst the foe for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom though war nor no known quarrel were in question but that defences musters preparations should be maintaind assembled and collected as were a war in expectation therefore i say tis meet we all go forth to view the sick and feeble parts of france and let us do it with no show of fear no with no more than if we heard that england were busied with a whitsun morrisdance for my good liege she is so idly kingd her sceptre so fantastically borne by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth that fear attends her not o peace prince dauphin you are too much mistaken in this king question your grace the late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy how well supplied

on mountain standing up in the air crownd with the golden sun saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature and deface the patterns that by god and by french fathers had twenty

borrowd glories that by gift of heaven by law of nature and of nations long to him and to his heirs namely the crown and all widestretched honours that pertain by custom and the ordinance of times unto the crown of france that you may know tis no sinister nor no awkward claim pickd from the wormholes of longvanishd days nor from the dust of old oblivion raked he sends you this most memorable line in every branch truly demonstrative willing to overlook this pedigree and when you find him evenly derived from his most famed of famous ancestors edward the third he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom indirectly held from him the native and true challenger or else what follows bloody constraint for if you hide the crown even in your hearts there will he rake for it therefore in fierce tempest is he coming in thunder and in earthquake like a jove that if requiring fail he will compel and bids you in the bowels of the lord deliver up the crown and to take mercy on the poor souls for whom this hungry war opens his vasty jaws and on your head turning the widows tears the orphans cries the dead mens blood the pining maidens groans for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers

march for i am sure when he shall see our army hell drop his heart into the sink of fear and for achievement offer us his ransom therefore lord constable haste on montjoy and let him say to england that we send to know what willing ransom he will give prince dauphin you shall stay with us in rouen not so i do beseech your majesty be patient for you shall remain with us now forth lord constable and princes all and quickly bring us word of englands fall exeunt scene vi the english camp in picardy enter gower and fluellen meeting how now captain fluellen come you from the bridge i assure you there is very excellent services committed at the bridge is the duke of exeter safe the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon and a man that i love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power he is notgod be praised and blessedany hurt in the world but keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge i think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no estimation in the world but did see him do as gallant service what do you call him he is called aunchient pistol i know him not enter pistol here is the man captain i thee beseech to do me favours the duke of exeter doth love thee well ay i praise god and i have merited some love at his hands bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate and giddy fortunes furious fickle wheel that goddess blind that stands upon the rolling restless stone by your patience aunchient pistol fortune is painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it fortune is an excellent moral fortune is bardolphs foe and frowns on him for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be a damned death let gallows gape for dog let man go free and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate but exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little price therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice and let not bardolphs vital thread be cut with edge of penny cord and vile reproach speak captain for his life and i will thee requite aunchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning why then rejoice therefore certainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother i would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline ought to be used die and be damnd and figo for thy friendship it is well the fig of spain exit very good why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal i remember him now a bawd a cutpurse ill assure you a uttered as brave words at the bridge as you shall see in a summers day but it is very well what he has spoke to me that is well i warrant you when time is serve why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into london under the form of a soldier and such fellows are perfect in the great commanders names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what a beard of the generals cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and alewashed wits is wonderful to be thought on but you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistook i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if i find a hole in his coat i will tell him my mind drum heard hark you the king is coming and i must speak with him from the pridge drum and colours enter king henry gloucester and soldiers god pless your majesty how now fluellen camest thou from the bridge ay so please your majesty the duke of exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge the french is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages marry th athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the duke of exeter is master of the pridge i can tell your majesty the duke is a prave man what men have you lost fluellen the perdition of th athversary hath been very great reasonable great marry for my part i think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fires out we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner tucket enter montjoy you know me by my habit well then i know thee what shall i know of thee my masters mind unfold it thus says my king say thou to harry of england though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness tell him we could have rebuked him at harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial england shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounced so far my king and master so much my office what is thy name i know thy quality montjoy thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessened and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france hath blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbour stand in our way theres for thy labour montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself if we may pass we will if we be hinderd we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it so tell your master i shall deliver so thanks to your highness exit i hope they will not come upon us now we are in gods hand brother not in theirs march to the bridge it now draws toward night beyond the river well encamp ourselves and on tomorrow bid them march away exeunt scene vii the french camp near agincourt enter the constable of france the lord rambures orleans dauphin with others tut i have the best armour of the world would it were day you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due it is the best horse of europe will it never be morning my lord of orleans and my lord high constable you talk of horse and armour you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world what a long night is this i will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the pegasus chez les narines de feu when i bestride him i soar i am a hawk he trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes hes of the colour of the nutmeg and of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage no more cousin nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereigns sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him i once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus wonder of nature i have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistress then did they imitate that which i composed to my courser for my horse is my mistress your mistress bears well me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back so perhaps did yours mine was not bridled o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of ireland your french hose off and in your straight strossers you have good judgment in horsemanship be warned by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs i had rather have my horse to my mistress i had as lief have my mistress a jade i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow to my mistress le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et la truie lavee au bourbier thou makest use of any thing yet do i not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose my lord constable the armour that i saw in your tent tonight are those stars or suns upon it stars my lord some of them will fall tomorrow i hope and yet my sky shall not want that may be for you bear a many superfluously and twere more honour some were away even as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted would i were able to load him with his desert will it never be day i will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with english faces i will not say so for fear i should be faced out of my way but i would it were morning for i would fain be about the ears of the english who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them tis midnight ill go arm myself exit the dauphin longs for morning he longs to eat the english i think he will eat all he kills by the white hand of my lady hes a gallant prince swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath he is simply the most active gentleman of france doing is activity and he will still be doing he never did harm that i heard of nor will do none tomorrow he will keep that good name still i know him to be valiant i was told that  by one that knows him better than you whats he marry he told me so himself and he said he cared not who knew it he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him by my faith sir but it is never any body saw it but his lackey tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate ill will never said well i will cap that proverb with there is flattery in friendship and i will take up that with give the devil his due well placed there stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with a pox of the devil you are the better at proverbs by how much a fools bolt is soon shot you have shot over tis not the first time you were overshot enter a messenger my lord high constable the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents who hath measured the ground the lord grandpre a valiant and most expert gentleman would it were day alas poor harry of england he longs not for the dawning as we do what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of england to mope with his fatbrained followers so far out of his knowledge if the english had any apprehension they would run away that they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces that island of england breeds very valiant creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples you may as well say thats a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils ay but these english are shrewdly out of beef then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight now is it time to arm come shall we about it it is now two oclock but let me see by ten we shall have each a hundred englishmen exeunt act iv prologue enter chorus now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fixed sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each others watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the others umberd face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents the armourers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning name proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and overlusty french do the lowrated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardygaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away the poor condemned english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the mornings danger and their gesture sad investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats presenteth them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruind band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour unto the weary and allwatched night but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks a largess universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to every one thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night and so our scene must to the battle fly whereo for pitywe shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils right illdisposed in brawl ridiculous the name of agincourt yet sit and see minding true things by what their mockeries be exit scene i the english camp at agincourt enter king henry bedford and gloucester gloucester tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be good morrow brother bedford god almighty there is some soul of goodness in things evil would men observingly distil it out for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself enter erpingham good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france not so my liege this lodging likes me better since i may say now lie i like a king tis good for men to love their present pains upon example so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quickend out of doubt the organs though defunct and dead before break up their drowsy grave and newly move with casted slough and fresh legerity lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both commend me to the princes in our camp do my good morrow to them and anon desire them an to my pavilion we shall my liege shall i attend your grace no my good knight go with my brothers to my lords of england i and my

sorts well with your fierceness enter fluellen and gower captain fluellen so in the name of jesu christ speak lower it is the greatest admiration of the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of pompey the great you shall find i warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble pabble in pompeys camp i warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise why the enemy is loud you hear him all night if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own conscience now i will speak lower i pray you and beseech you that you will exeunt gower and fluellen though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valour in this welshman enter three soldiers john bates alexander court and michael williams brother john bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we shall never see the end of it who goes there a friend under what captain serve you under sir thomas erpingham a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you what thinks he of our estate even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide he hath not told his thought to the king no nor it is not meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself any where but where he is then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens minds methinks i could not die any where so contented as in the kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable thats more than we know ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his masters command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servants damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is vengeance so that here men are punished for beforebreach of the kings laws in now the kings quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subjects duty is the kings but every subjects soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer it but i do not desire he should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lustily for him i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we neer the wiser if i live to see it i will never trust his word after you pay him then thats a perilous shot out of an eldergun that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacocks feather youll never trust his word after come tis a foolish saying your reproof is something too round i should be angry with you if the time were convenient let it be a quarrel between us if you live i embrace it how shall i know thee again give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel heres my glove give me another of thine there this will i also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow this is my glove by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear if ever i live to see it i will challenge it thou darest as well be hanged well i will do it though i take thee in the kings company keep thy word fare thee well be friends you english fools be friends we have french quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper exeunt soldiers upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king we must bear all o hard condition twinborn with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite heartsease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idle ceremony what kind of god art thou that sufferst more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers what are thy rents what are thy comings in o ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul of adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being feard than they in fearing what drinkst thou oft instead of homage sweet but poisond flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure thinkst thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that playst so subtly with a kings repose i am a king that find thee and i know tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the intertissued robe of gold and pearl the farced title running fore the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thricegorgeous ceremony not all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body filld and vacant mind gets him to rest crammd with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lackey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn doth rise and help hyperion to his horse and follows so the everrunning year with profitable labour to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep had the forehand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the countrys peace enjoys

interred anew and on it have bestowd more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood five hundred poor i have in yearly pay who twice aday their witherd hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richards soul more will i do though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after

valour will oerturn them tis positive gainst all exceptions lords that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants who in unnecessary action swarm about our squares of battle were enow to purge this

lords of france yon island carrions desperate of their bones illfavouredly become the morning field their ragged curtains poorly are let loose and our air shakes them passing scornfully big mars seems bankrupt in their beggard host and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks with torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips the gum downroping from their paledead eyes and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit lies foul with chewd grass still and motionless and their executors the knavish crows fly oer them all impatient for their hour description cannot suit itself in words to demonstrate the life of such a battle in life so lifeless as it shows itself they have said their prayers and they stay for

own fertility her vine the merry cheerer of the heart unpruned dies her hedges evenpleachd like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair put forth disorderd twigs her fallow leas the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory doth root upon while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank conceives by idleness and nothing teems but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs losing both beauty and utility and as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges

exeunt epilogue enter chorus thus far with rough and allunable pen our bending author hath pursued the story in little room confining mighty men mangling by starts the full course of their glory small time but in that small most greatly lived this star of england fortune made his sword by which the worlds best garden be achieved and of it left his son imperial lord henry the sixth in infant bands crownd king of france and england did this king succeed whose state so many had the managing that they lost france and made his england bleed which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake in your fair minds let this acceptance take exit act i prologue i come no more to make you laugh things now that bear a weighty and a serious brow sad high and working full of state and woe such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow we now present those that can pity here may if they think it well let fall a tear the subject will deserve it such as give their money out of hope they may believe may here find truth too those that come to see only a show or two and so agree the play may pass if they be still and willing ill undertake may see away their shilling richly in two short hours only they that come to hear a merry bawdy play a noise of targets or to see a fellow in a long motley coat guarded with yellow will be deceived for gentle hearers know to rank our chosen truth with such a show as fool and fight is beside forfeiting our own brains and the opinion that we bring to make that only true we now intend will leave us never an understanding friend therefore for goodness sake and as you are known the first and happiest hearers of the town be sad as we would make ye think ye see the very persons of our noble story as they were living think you see them great and followd with the general throng and sweat of thousand friends then in a moment see how soon this mightiness meets misery and if you can be merry then ill say a man may weep upon his weddingday scene i london an antechamber in the palace enter norfolk at one door at the other buckingham and abergavenny good morrow and well met how have ye done since last we saw in france i thank your grace healthful and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there an untimely ague stayd me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four throned ones could have weighd such a compounded one all the whole time i was my chambers prisoner then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next days master till the last made former wonders its today the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and tomorrow they made britain india every man that stood showd like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins all guilt the madams too not used to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labour was to them as a painting now this masque was cried incomparable and the ensuing night made it a fool and beggar the two kings equal in lustre were now best now worst as presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both twas said they saw but one and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns for so they phrase emby their heralds challenged the noble spirits to arms they did perform beyond thoughts compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believed o you go far as i belong to worship and affect in honour honesty the tract of every thing would by a good discourser lose some life which actions self was tongue to all was royal to the disposing of it nought rebelld order gave each thing view the office did distinctly his full function who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess one certes that promises no element in such a business i pray you who my lord all this was orderd by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york the devil speed him no mans pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o the beneficial sun and keep it from the earth surely sir theres in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not proppd by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor calld upon for high feats done to the crown neither allied for eminent assistants but spiderlike out of his selfdrawing web he gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king i cannot tell what heaven hath given himlet some graver eye pierce into that but i can see his pride peep through each part of him whence has he that if not from hell the devil is a niggard or has given all before and he begins a new hell in himself why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o the king to appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in the papers i do know kinsmen of mine three at the least that have by this so sickened their estates that never they shall abound as formerly o many have broke their backs with laying manors on em for this great journey what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it every man after the hideous storm that followd was a thing inspired and not consulting broke into a general prophecy that this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach ont which is budded out for france hath flawd the league and hath attachd our merchants goods at bourdeaux is it therefore the ambassador is silenced marry ist a proper title of a peace and purchased at a superfluous rate why all this business our reverend cardinal carried like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safetythat you read the cardinals malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power you know his nature that hes revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edge its long and t may be said it reaches far and where twill not extend thither he darts it bosom up my counsel youll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him  certain of the guard and two secretaries with  papers cardinal wolsey in his passage fixeth his  eye on buckingham and buckingham on him both full of disdain the duke of buckinghams surveyor ha wheres his examination here

lord and let your reason with your choler question what tis you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a fullhot horse who being allowd his way selfmettle tires him

difference in no persons be advised heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself we may outrun by violent swiftness that which we run at and lose by overrunning know you not the fire that mounts the liquor til run oer in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion sir i am thankful to you and ill go along by your prescription but this topproud fellow whom from the flow of gall i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of gravel i do know to be corrupt and treasonous say not treasonous to the king ill sayt and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock attend this holy fox or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravenous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to performt his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty the interview that swallowd so much treasure and like a glass did break i the rinsing faith and so it did pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal the articles o the combination drew as himself pleased and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to the dead but our countcardinal has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it now this follows which as i take it is a kind of puppy to the old dam treasoncharles the emperor under pretence to see the queen his aunt for twas indeed his colour but he came to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peepd harms that menaced him he privily deals with our cardinal and as i trow which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted ere it was askd but when the way was made and paved with gold the emperor thus desired that he would please to alter the kings course and break the foresaid peace let the king know as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases and for his own advantage i am sorry to hear this of him and could wish he were something mistaken int no not a syllable i  do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof enter brandon a sergeantatarms before him and two or three of the guard your office sergeant execute it sir my lord the duke of buckingham

never name to us you have half our power the other moiety ere you ask is given repeat your will and take it thank your majesty that you would love yourself and in that love not unconsiderd leave your honour nor the dignity of your office is the point of my petition lady mine proceed i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among em which hath flawd the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master whose honour heaven shield from soileven he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion not almost appears it doth appear for upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put off the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compelld by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among then taxation wherein and what taxation my lord cardinal you that are blamed for it alike with us know you of this taxation please you sir i know but of a single part in aught pertains to the state and front but in that file where others tell steps with me no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to the bearing and to bear em the back is sacrifice to the load they say they are devised by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation still exaction the nature of it in what kind lets know is this exaction i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am boldend under your promised pardon the subjects grief comes through commissions which compel from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretence for this is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and its come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business by my life this is against our pleasure and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not passd me but by learned approbation of the judges if i am traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow that is newtrimmd but benefit no further than vainly longing what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allowd what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mockd or carpd at we should take root here where we sit or sit statestatues only things done well and with a care exempt themselves from fear things done without example in their issue are to be feard have you a precedent of this commission i believe not any we must not rend our subjects from our laws and stick them in our will sixth part of each a trembling contribution why we take from every tree lop bark and part o the timber and though we leave it with a root thus hackd the air will drink the sap to every county where this is questiond send our letters with free pardon to each man that has denied the force of this commission pray look tot i put it to your care a word with you to the secretary let there be letters writ to every shire of the kings grace and pardon the grieved commons hardly conceive of me let it be noised that through our intercession this revokement and pardon comes i shall anon advise you further in the proceeding exit secretary enter surveyor i am sorry that the duke of buckingham is run in your displeasure it grieves many the gentleman is learnd and a most rare speaker to nature none more bound his training such that he may furnish and instruct great teachers and never seek for aid out of himself yet see when these so noble benefits shall prove not well disposed the mind growing once corrupt they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly than ever they were fair this man so complete who was enrolld mongst wonders and when we almost with ravishd listening could not find his hour of speech a minute he my lady hath into monstrous habits put the graces that once were his and is become as black as if besmeard in hell sit by us you shall hear this was his gentleman in trustof him things to strike honour sad bid him recount the forerecited practises whereof we cannot feel too little hear too much stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you most like a careful subject have collected out of the duke of buckingham speak freely first it was usual with him every day it would infect his speech that if the king should without issue die hell carry it so to make the sceptre his these very words ive heard him utter to his soninlaw lord abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced revenge upon the cardinal please your highness note this dangerous conception in this point not friended by by his wish to your high person his will is most malignant and it stretches beyond you to your friends my learnd lord cardinal deliver all with charity speak on how grounded he his title to the crown upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him at any time speak aught he was brought to this by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins what was that hopkins sir a chartreux friar his confessor who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty how knowst thou this not long before your highness sped to france the duke being at the rose within the parish saint lawrence poultney did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey i replied men feard the french would prove perfidious to the kings danger presently the duke said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted twould prove the verity of certain words spoke by a holy monk that oft says he hath sent to me wishing me to permit john de la car my chaplain a choice hour to hear from him a matter of some moment whom after under the confessions seal he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke my chaplain to no creature living but to me should utter with demure confidence this pausingly ensued neither the king nors heirs tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive to gain the love o the commonalty the duke shall govern england if i know you well you were the dukes surveyor and lost your office on the complaint o the tenants take good heed you charge not in your spleen a noble person and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed yes heartily beseech you let him on go forward on my soul ill speak but truth i told my lord the duke by the devils illusions the monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him to ruminate on this so far until it forged him some design which being believed it was much like to do he answerd tush it can do me no damage adding further that had the king in his last sickness faild the cardinals and sir thomas lovells heads should have gone off ha what so rank ah ha theres mischief in this man canst thou say further i can my liege proceed being at greenwich after your highness had reproved the duke about sir william blomer i remember of such a time being my sworn servant the duke retaind him his but on what hence if quoth he i for this had been committed as to the tower i thought i would have playd the part my father meant to act upon the usurper richard who being at salisbury made suit to come ins presence which if granted as he made semblance of his duty would have put his knife to him a giant traitor now madam may his highness live in freedom and this man out of prison god mend all theres something more would out of thee what sayst after the duke his father with the knife he stretchd him and with one hand on his dagger another spread ons breast mounting his eyes he

exeunt with trumpets act ii scene i westminster a street enter two gentlemen meeting whither away so fast o god save ye even to the hall to hear what shall become of the great duke of buckingham ill save you that labour sir alls now done but the ceremony of bringing back the prisoner were you there yes indeed was i pray speak what has happend you may guess quickly what is he found guilty yes truly is he and condemnd upont i am sorry fort so are a number more but pray how passd it ill tell you in a little the great duke came to the bar where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law the kings attorney on the contrary urged on the examinations proofs confessions of divers witnesses which the duke desired to have brought viva voce to his face at which appeard against him his surveyor sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car confessor to him with that devilmonk hopkins that made this mischief that was he that fed him with his prophecies the same all these accused him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but indeed he could not and so his peers upon this evidence have found him guilty of high treason much he spoke and learnedly for life but all was either pitied in him or forgotten after all this how did he bear himself when he was brought again to the bar to hear his knell rung out his judgment he was stirrd with such an agony he sweat extremely and something spoke in choler ill and hasty but he fell to himself again and sweetly in all the rest showd a most noble patience i do not think he fears death sure he does not he never was so womanish the cause he may a little grieve at certainly the cardinal is the end of this tis likely by all conjectures first kildares attainder then deputy of ireland who removed earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too lest he should help his father that trick of state was a deep envious one at his return no doubt he will requite it this is noted and generally whoever the king favours the cardinal instantly will find employment and far enough from court too all the commons hate him perniciously and o my conscience wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham the mirror of all courtesy stay there sir and see the noble ruind man you speak of enter buckingham from his arraignment tipstaves  before him the axe with the edge towards him  halberds on each side accompanied with lovell vaux sands and common people lets stand close and behold him all good people you that thus far have come to pity me hear what i say and then go home and lose me i have this day received a traitors judgment and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness and if i have a co nscience let it sink me even as the axe falls if i be not faithful the law i bear no malice for my death t has done upon the premises but justice but those that sought it i could wish more christians be what they will i heartily forgive em yet let em look they glory not in mischief nor build their evils on the graves of great men for then my guiltless blood must cry against em for further life in this world i neer hope nor will i sue although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults you few that loved me and dare be bold to weep for buckingham his noble friends and fellows whom to leave is only bitter to him only dying go with me like good angels to my end and as the long divorce of steel falls on me make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice and lift my soul to heaven lead on o gods name i do beseech your grace for charity if ever any malice in your heart were hid against me now to forgive me frankly sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you as i would be forgiven i forgive all there cannot be those numberless offences gainst me that i cannot take peace with no black envy shall mark my grave commend me to his grace and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him you met him half in heaven my vows and prayers yet are the kings and till my soul forsake shall cry for blessings on him may he live longer than i have time to tell his years ever beloved and loving may his rule be and when old time shall lead him to his end goodness and he fill up one monument to the water side i must conduct your grace then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux who undertakes you to your end prepare there the duke is coming see the barge be ready and fit it with such furniture as suits the greatness of his person nay sir nicholas let it alone my state now will but mock me when i came hither i was lord high constable and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun yet i am richer than my base accusers that never knew what truth meant i now seal it and with that blood will make em one day groan fort my noble father henry of buckingham who first raised head against usurping richard flying for succor to his servant banister being distressd was by that wretch betrayd and without trial fell gods peace be with him henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying my fathers loss like a most royal prince restored me to my honours and out of ruins made my name once more noble now his son henry the eighth life honour name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world i had my trial and must needs say a noble one which makes me a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortunes both fell by our servants by those men we loved most a most unnatural and faithless service heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose for those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye all good people pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me farewell and when you would say something that is sad speak how i fell i have done and god forgive me exeunt buckingham and train o this is full of pity sir it calls i fear too many curses on their beads that were the authors if the duke be guiltless tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling of an ensuing evil if it fall greater than this good angels keep it from us what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir this secret is so weighty twill require a strong faith to conceal it let me have it i do not talk much i am confident you shall sir did you not of late days hear a buzzing of a separation between the king and katharine yes but it held not for when the king once heard it out of anger he sent command to the lord mayor straight to stop the rumor and allay those tongues that durst disperse it but that slander sir is found a truth now for it grows again fresher than eer it was and held for certain the king will venture at it either the cardinal or some about him near have out of malice to the good queen possessd him with a scruple that will undo her to confirm this too cardinal campeius is arrived and lately as all think for this business tis the cardinal and merely to revenge him on the emperor for not bestowing on him at his asking the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed i think you have hit the mark but ist not cruel that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal will have his will and she must fall tis woful we are too open here to argue this lets think in private more exeunt scene ii an antechamber in the palace enter chamberlain reading a letter my lord the horses your lordship sent for with all the care i had i saw well chosen ridden and furnished they were young and handsome and of the best breed in the north when they were ready to set out for london a man of my lord cardinals by

he will have all i think enter to chamberlain norfolk and suffolk well met my lord chamberlain good day to both your graces how is the king employd i left him private full of sad thoughts and troubles whats the cause it seems the marriage with his brothers wife has crept too near his conscience no his conscience has crept too near another lady tis so this is the cardinals doing the kingcardinal that blind priest like the eldest son of fortune turns what he list the king will know him one day pray god he do hell never know himself else how holily he works in all his business and with what zeal for now he has crackd the league between us and the emperor the queens great nephew he dives into the kings soul and there scatters dangers doubts wringing of the conscience fears and despairs and all these for his marriage and out of all these to restore the king he counsels a divorce a loss of her that like a jewel has hung twenty years about his neck yet never lost her lustre of her that loves him with that excellence that angels love good men with even of her that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls will bless the king and is not this course pious heaven keep me from such counsel tis most true these news are every where every tongue speaks em and every true heart weeps fort all that dare look into these affairs see this main end the french kings sister heaven will one day open the kings eyes that so long have slept upon this bold bad man and free us from his slavery we had need pray and heartily for our deliverance or this imperious man will work us all from

have i offended you what cause hath my behavior given to your displeasure that thus you should proceed to put me off and take your good grace from me heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wife at all times to your will conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too or which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger did i continue in my liking

father king of spain was reckond one the wisest prince that there had reignd by many a year before it is not to be questiond that they had gatherd a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deemd our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not i the name of god your pleasure be fulfilld you have here lady and of your choice these reverend fathers men of singular integrity and learning yea the elect o the land who are assembled to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless that longer you desire the court as well for your own quiet as to rectify what is unsettled in the king his grace hath spoken well and justly therefore madam its fit this royal session do proceed and that without delay their arguments be now produced and heard lord cardinal to you i speak your pleasure madam sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dreamd so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears ill turn to sparks of fire be patient yet i will when you are humble nay before or god will punish me i do believe induced by potent circumstances that you are mine enemy and make my challenge you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me which gods dew quench therefore i say again i utterly abhor yea from my soul refuse you for my judge whom yet once more i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth i do profess you speak not like yourself who ever yet have stood to charity and displayd the effects of disposition gentle and of wisdom oertopping womans power madam you do me wrong i have no spleen against you nor injustice for you or any how far i have proceeded or how far further shall is warranted by a commission from the consistory yea the whole consistory of rome you charge me that i have blown this coal i do deny it the king is present if it be known to him that i gainsay my deed how may he wound and worthily my falsehood yea as much as you have done my truth if he know that i am free of your report he knows i am not of your wrong therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is to remove these thoughts from you the which before his highness shall speak in i do beseech you gracious madam to unthink your speaking and to say so no more my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak to oppose your cunning youre meek and humblemouthd you sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is crammd with arrogancy spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness favours gone slightly oer low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will ast please yourself pronounce their office i must tell you you tender more your persons honour than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause fore his holiness and to be judged by him she curtsies to king henry viii and offers to depart the queen is obstinate stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and disdainful to be tried byt tis not well shes going away call her again katharine queen of england come into the court madam you are calld back what need you note it pray you keep your way when you are calld return now the lord help they vex me past my patience pray you pass on i will not tarry no nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts exeunt queen katharine and her attendants go thy ways kate that man i the world who shall report he has a better wife let him in nought be trusted for speaking false in that thou art alone if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness thy meekness saintlike wifelike government obeying in commanding and thy parts sovereign and pious else could speak thee out the queen of earthly queens shes noble born and like her true nobility she has carried herself towards me most gracious sir in humblest manner i require your highness that it shall please you to declare in hearing of all these earsfor where i am robbd and bound there must i be unloosed although not there at once and fully satisfiedwhether ever i did broach this business to your highness or laid any scruple in your way which might induce you to the question ont or ever have to you but with thanks to god for such a royal lady spake one the least word that might be to the prejudice of her present state or touch of her good person my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honour i free you fromt you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to villagecurs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger youre excused but will you be more justified you ever have wishd the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirrd but oft have hinderd oft the passages made toward it on my honour i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me tot i will be bold with time and your attention then mark the inducement thus it came give heed tot my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches utterd by the bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i the progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometimes our brothers wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience enterd me yea with a splitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and pressd in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my ladys womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life tot than the grave does to the dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had aird them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o the world should not be gladded int by me then follows that i weighd the danger which my realms stood in by this my issues fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together thats to say i meant to rectify my consciencewhich i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learnd first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you very well my liege i have spoke long be pleased yourself to say how far you satisfied me so please your highness the question did at first so stagger me bearing a state of mighty moment int and consequence of dread that i committed the daringst counsel which i had to doubt and did entreat your highness to this course which you are running here i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i the world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons drive this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her katharine our queen before the primest creature thats paragond o the world so please your highness the queen being absent tis a needful fitness that we adjourn this court till further day meanwhile must be an earnest motion made to the queen to call back her appeal she intends unto his holiness asidei may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learnd and wellbeloved servant cranmer prithee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on exeunt in manner as they entered act iii scene i london queen katharines apartments enter queen katharine and her women as at work take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles sing and disperse em if thou canst leave working song orpheus with his lute made trees and the mountain tops that freeze bow themselves when he did sing to his music

erga te mentis integritas regina serenissima o good my lord no latin i am not such a truant since my coming as not to know the language i have lived in a strange tongue makes my cause more strange

be absolved in english noble lady i am sorry my integrity should breed and service to his majesty and you so deep suspicion where all faith was meant we come not by the way of accusation to taint that honour every good tongue blesses nor to betray you any way to sorrow you have too much good lady but to know how you stand minded in the weighty difference between the king and you and to deliver like free and honest men our just opinions and comforts to your cause most honourd madam my lord of york out of his noble nature zeal and obedience he still bore your grace forgetting like a good man your late censure both of his truth and him which was too far offers as i do in a sign of peace his service and his counsel asideto betray me my lords i thank you both for your good wills ye speak like

graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless madam you wrong the kings love with these fears your hopes and friends are infinite in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any englishman dare give me counsel or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject nay forsooth my friends they that must weigh out my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my other comforts far hence in mine own country lords i would your grace would leave your griefs and take my counsel how sir put your main cause into the kings protection hes loving and most gracious twill be much both for your honour better and your cause for if the trial of the law oertake ye youll part away disgraced he tells you rightly ye tell me what ye wish for bothmy ruin is this your christian counsel out upon ye heaven is above all yet there sits a judge that no king can

heed lest at once the burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye madam this is a mere distraction you turn the good we offer into envy ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye and all such false professors would you have me if you have any justice any pity if ye be any thing but churchmens habits put my sick cause into his hands that hates me alas has banishd me his bed already his love too long ago i am old my lords and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience what can happen to me above this wretchedness all your studies make me a curse like this your fears are worse have i lived thus

starts stops on a sudden looks upon the ground then lays his finger on his temple straight springs out into fast gait then stops again strikes his breast hard and anon he casts his eye against the moon in most strange postures we have seen him set himself it may well be there is a mutiny ins mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found thereon my conscience put unwittingly forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject its heavens will some spirit put this paper in the packet to bless your eye withal if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fixd on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering king henry viii takes his seat whispers lovell who goes to cardinal wolsey heaven forgive

huntsman that has galld him then makes him nothing i must read this paper i fear the story of his anger tis so this paper has undone me tis the account of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome o negligence fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king is there no way to cure this no new device to beat this from his brains i know twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again whats this to the pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ tos holiness nay then farewell i have touchd the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation m the evening and no man see me more reenter to cardinal wolsey norfolk and suffolk surrey and the chamberlain hear the kings pleasure cardinal who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands and to confine yourself to asher house my lord of winchesters till you hear further from his highness stay wheres your commission lords words cannot carry authority so weighty who dare cross em bearing the kings will from his mouth expressly till i find more than will or words to do it i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy how eagerly ye follow my disgraces as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honours during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letterspatents now wholl take it the king that gave it it must be himself then thou art a proud traitor priest proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so thy ambition thou scarlet sin robbd this bewailing land of noble buckingham my fatherinlaw the heads of all thy brother cardinals with thee and all thy best parts bound together weighd not a hair of his plague of your policy you sent me deputy for ireland far from his succor from the king from all that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him whilst your great goodness out of holy pity absolved him with an axe this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honour that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies by my soul your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel my sword i the lifeblood of thee else my lords can ye endure to hear this arrogance and from this fellow if we live thus tamely to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet farewell nobility let his grace go forward and dare us with his cap like larks all goodness is poison to thy stomach yes that goodness of gleaning all the lands wealth into one into your own hands cardinal by extortion the goodness of your intercepted packets you writ to the pope against the king your goodness since you provoke me shall be most notorious my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble as you respect the common good the state of our despised nobility our issues who if he live will scarce be gentlemen produce the grand sum of his sins the articles collected from his life ill startle you worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal how much methinks i could despise this man but that i am bound in charity against it those articles my lord are in the kings hand but thus much they are foul ones so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth this cannot save you i thank my memory i yet remember some of these articles and out they shall now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal youll show a little honesty speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners i had rather want those than my head have at you first that without the kings assent or knowledge you wrought to be a legate by which power you maimd the jurisdiction of all bishops then that in all you writ to rome or else to foreign princes ego et rex meus was still inscribed in which you brought the king to be your servant then that without the knowledge either of king or council when you went ambassador to the emperor you made bold to carry into flanders the great seal item you sent a large commission to gregory de cassado to conclude without the kings will or the states allowance a league between his highness and ferrara that out of mere ambition you have caused your holy hat to be stampd on the kings coin then that you have sent innumerable substance by what means got i leave to your own conscience to furnish rome and to prepare the ways you have for dignities to the mere undoing of all the kingdom many more there are which since they are of you and odious i will not taint my mouth with o my lord press not a falling man too far tis virtue his faults lie open to the laws let them not you correct him my heart weeps to see him so little of his great self i forgive him lord cardinal the kings further pleasure is because all those things you have done of late by your power legatine within this kingdom fall into the compass of a praemunire that therefore such a writ be sued against you to forfeit all your goods lands tenements chattels and whatsoever and to be out of the kings protection this is my charge and so well leave you to your meditations how to live better for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you so fare you well my little good lord cardinal exeunt all but cardinal wolsey so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honours thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is aripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my highblown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye i feel my heart new opend o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favours there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again enter cromwell and stands amazed why how now cromwell i have no power to speak sir what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am falln indeed how does your grace why well never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience the king has cured me i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders these ruind pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honour o tis a burthen cromwell tis a burthen too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven i am glad your grace has made that right use of it i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weakhearted enemies dare offer what news abroad the heaviest and the worst is your displeasure with the king god bless him the next is that sir thomas more is chosen lord chancellor in your place thats somewhat sudden but hes a learned man may he continue long in his highness favour and do justice for truths sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more that cranmer is returnd with welcome installd lord archbishop of canterbury thats news indeed last that the lady anne whom the king hath in secrecy long married this day was viewd in open as his queen going to chapel and the voice is now only about her coronation there was the weight that pulld me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost for ever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor falln man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him i know his noble naturenot to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety o my lord must i then leave you must i needs forego so good so noble and so true a master bear witness all that have not hearts of iron with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord the king shall have my service but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman lets dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missd it mark but my fall and that that ruind me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys thy gods and truths then if thou fallst o cromwell thou fallst a blessed martyr serve the king andprithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny tis the kings my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies good sir have patience so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell exeunt act iv scene i a street in westminster enter two gentlemen meeting one another youre well met once again so are you you come to take your stand here and behold the lady anne pass from her coronation tis all my business at our last encounter the duke of buckingham came from his trial tis very true but that time offerd sorrow this general joy tis well the citizens i am sure have shown at full their royal minds as let em have their rights they are ever forward in celebration of this day with shows pageants and sights of honour never greater nor ill assure you better taken sir may i be bold to ask at what that contains that paper in your hand yes tis the list of those that claim their offices this day by custom of the coronation the duke of suffolk is the first and claims to be highsteward next the duke of norfolk he to be earl marshal you may read the rest i thank you sir had i not known those customs i should have been beholding to your paper but i beseech you whats become of katharine the princess dowager how goes her business that i can tell you too the archbishop of canterbury accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers of his order held a late court at dunstable six miles off from ampthill where the princess lay to which she was often cited by them but appeard not and to be short for not appearance and the kings late scruple by the main assent of all these learned men she was divorced and the late marriage made of none effect since which she was removed to kimbolton where she remains now sick alas good lady trumpets the trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming hautboys the order of the coronation 1 a lively flourish of trumpets 2 then two judges 3 lord chancellor with the purse and mace before him 4 choristers singing music 5 mayor of london bearing the mace then garter in his coat of arms and on his head a gilt copper crown 6 marquess dorset bearing a sceptre of gold on his head a demicoronal of gold with him surrey bearing the rod of silver with the dove crowned with an earls coronet collars of ss 7 suffolk in his robe of estate his coronet on his head bearing a long white wand as highsteward with him norfolk with the rod of marshalship a coronet on his head collars of ss 8 a canopy borne by four of the cinqueports under it queen anne in her robe in her hair richly adorned with pearl crowned on each side her the bishops of london and winchester 9 the old duchess of norfolk in a coronal of gold wrought with flowers bearing queen annes train 10 certain ladies or countesses with plain circlets of gold without flowers they pass over the stage in order and state a royal train believe me these i know whos that that bears the sceptre marquess dorset and that the earl of surrey with the rod a bold brave gentleman that should be the duke of suffolk tis the same highsteward and that my lord of norfolk yes heaven bless thee looking on queen anne thou hast the sweetest face i ever lookd on sir as i have a soul she is an angel our king has all the indies in his arms and more and richer when he strains that lady i cannot blame his conscience they that bear the cloth of honour over her are four barons of the cinqueports those men are happy and so are all are near her i take it she that carries up the train is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk it is and all the rest are countesses their coronets say so these are stars indeed and sometimes falling ones no more of that exit procession and then a great flourish of trumpets enter a third gentleman god save you sir where have you been broiling among the crowd i the abbey where a finger could not be wedged in more i am stifled with the mere rankness of their joy you saw the ceremony that i did how was it well worth the seeing good sir speak it to us as well as i am able the rich stream of lords and ladies having brought the queen to a prepared place in the choir fell off a distance from her while her grace sat down to rest awhile some half an hour or so in a rich chair of state opposing freely the beauty of her person to the people believe me sir she is the goodliest woman that ever lay by man which when the people had the full view of such a noise arose as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks doublets i thinkflew up and had their faces been loose this day they had been lost such joy i never saw before greatbellied women that had not half a week to go like rams in the old time of war would shake the press and make em reel before em no man living could say this is my wife there all were woven so strangely in one piece but what followd at length her grace rose and with modest paces came to the altar where she kneeld and saintlike cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayd devoutly then rose again and bowd her to the people when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen as holy oil edward confessors crown the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems laid nobly on her which performd the choir with all the choicest music of the kingdom together sung te deum so she parted and with the same full state paced back again to yorkplace where the feast is held sir you must no more call it yorkplace thats past for since the cardinal fell that titles lost tis now the kings and calld whitehall i know it but tis so lately alterd that the old name is fresh about me what two reverend bishops were those that went on each side of the queen stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester newly preferrd from the kings secretary the other london he of winchester is held no great good lover of the archbishops the virtuous cranmer all the land knows that however yet there is no great breach when it comes cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him who may that be i pray you thomas cromwell a man in much esteem with the king and truly a worthy friend the king has made him master o the jewel house and one already of the privy council he will deserve more yes without all doubt come gentlemen ye shall go my way which is to the court and there ye shall be my guests something i can command as i walk thither ill tell ye more you may command us sir exeunt scene ii kimbolton enter katharine dowager sick led between griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman how does your grace o griffith sick to death my legs like loaden branches bow to the earth willing to leave their burthen reach a chair so now methinks i feel a little ease didst thou not tell me griffith as thou ledst me that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead yes madam but i think your grace out of the pain you sufferd gave no ear tot prithee good griffith tell me how he died if well he steppd before me happily for my example well the voice goes madam for after the stout earl northumberland arrested him at york and brought him forward as a man sorely tainted to his answer he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill he could not sit his mule alas poor man at last with easy roads he came to leicester lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot with all his covent honourably received him to whom he gave these words o father abbot an old man broken with the storms of state is come to lay his weary bones among ye give him a little earth for charity so went to bed where eagerly his sickness pursued him still and three nights after this about the hour of eight which he himself foretold should be his last full of repentance continual meditations tears and sorrows he gave his honours to the world again his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was fairplay his own opinion was his law i the presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he is now nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy in example noble madam mens evil manners live in brass their virtues we write in water may it please your highness to hear me speak his good now yes good griffith i were malicious else this cardinal though from an humble stock undoubtedly was fashiond to much honour from his cradle he was a scholar and a ripe and good one exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading lofty and sour to them that loved him not but to those men that sought him sweet as summer and though he were unsatisfied in getting which was a sin yet in bestowing madam he was most princely ever witness for him those twins of learning that he raised in you ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him unwilling to outlive the good that did it the other though unfinishd yet so famous so excellent in art and still so rising that christendom shall ever speak his virtue his overthrow heapd happiness upon him for then and not till then he felt himself and found the blessedness of being little and to add greater honours to his age than man could give him he died fearing god after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honour from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith whom i most hated living thou hast made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honour peace be with him patience be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to sad and solemn music she is asleep good wench lets sit down quiet for fear we wake her softly gentle patience the vision enter solemnly tripping one after  another six personages clad in white robes  wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden  vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in  their hands they first congee unto her then  dance and at certain changes the first two hold  a spare garland over her head at which the other  four make reverent curtsies then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two  who observe the same order in their changes and  holding the garland over her head which done  they deliver the same garland to the last two who  likewise observe the same order at which as it  were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven  and so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them the music continues spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye madam we are here it is not you i call for saw ye none enter since i slept none madam no saw you not even now a blessed troop invite me to a banquet whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me like the sun they promised me eternal happiness and brought me garlands griffith which i feel i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly i am most joyful madam such good dreams possess your fancy bid the music leave they are harsh and heavy to me music ceases do you note how much her grace is alterd on the sudden how long her face is drawn how pale she looks and of an earthy cold mark her eyes she is going wench pray pray heaven comfort her enter a messenger ant like your grace you are a saucy fellow

honourgiving hand of coeurdelion knighted in the field what art thou the son and heir to that same faulconbridge is that the elder and art thou the heir you came not of one mother then it seems most certain of one mother mighty king that is well known and as i think one father but for the certain knowledge of that truth i put you oer to heaven and to my mother of that i doubt as all mens children may out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother and wound her honour with this diffidence i madam no i have no reason for it that is my brothers plea and none of mine the which if he can prove a pops me out at least from fair five hundred pound a year heaven guard my mothers honour and my land a good blunt fellow why being younger born doth he lay claim to thine inheritance i know not why except to get the land but once he slanderd me with bastardy but whether i be as true begot or no that still i lay upon my mothers head but that i am as well begot my liege fair fall the bones that

the king and in the mean time sojournd at my fathers where how he did prevail i shame to speak but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores between my father and my mother lay as i have heard my father speak himself when this same lusty gentleman was got upon his deathbed he by will bequeathd his lands to me and took it on his death that this my mothers son was none of his and if he were he came into the world full fourteen weeks before the course of time then good my liege let me have what is mine my fathers land as was my fathers will sirrah your brother is legitimate your fathers wife did after wedlock bear him and if she did play false the fault was hers which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands that marry wives tell me how if my brother who as you say took pains to get

their foes open your gates and gives the victors way heralds from off our towers we might behold from first to last the onset and retire of both your armies whose equality by our best eyes cannot be

whose passage vexd with thy impediment shall leave his native channel and oerswell with course disturbd even thy confining shores unless thou let his silver water keep a peaceful progress to the ocean england thou hast not saved one drop of blood in this hot trial more than we of france rather lost more and by this hand i swear that sways the earth this climate overlooks before we will lay down our justborne arms well put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear or add a royal number to the dead gracing the scroll that tells of this wars loss with slaughter coupled to the name of kings ha majesty how high thy glory towers when the rich blood of kings is set on fire o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men in undetermined differences of kings why stand these royal fronts amazed thus cry havoc kings back to the stained field you equal potents fiery kindled spirits then let confusion of

us that here hold up his right in us that are our own great deputy and bear possession of our person here lord of our presence angiers and of you a greater power then we denies all this and till it be undoubted we do lock our former scruple in our strongbarrd gates kingd of our fears until our fears resolved be by some certain king purged and deposed by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings and stand securely on their battlements as in a theatre whence they gape and point at your industrious scenes and acts of death your royal presences be ruled by me do like the mutines of jerusalem be friends awhile and both conjointly bend your sharpest deeds of malice on this town by east and west let france and england mount their battering cannon charged to the mouths till their soulfearing clamours have brawld down the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city ild play incessantly upon these jades even till unfenced desolation leave them as naked as the vulgar air that done dissever your united strengths and part your mingled colours once again turn face to face and bloody point to point then in a moment fortune shall cull forth out of one side her happy minion to whom in favour she shall give the day and kiss him with a glorious victory how like you this wild counsel mighty states smacks it not something of the policy now by the sky that hangs above our heads i

peevish town turn thou the mouth of thy artillery as we will ours against these saucy walls and when that we have dashd them to the ground why then defy each other and pellmell make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell let it be so say where will you assault we from the west will send destruction into this citys bosom i from the north our thunder from the south shall rain their drift of bullets on this town o prudent discipline from north to south austria and france shoot in each others mouth ill stir them to it come away away hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay and i shall show you peace and fairfaced league win you this city without stroke or wound rescue those breathing lives to die in beds that here come sacrifices for the field persever not but hear me mighty kings

of beauty where should he find it fairer than in blanch if zealous love should go in search of virtue where should he find it purer than in blanch if love ambitious sought a match of birth whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch such as she is in beauty virtue birth is the young dauphin every way complete if not complete of say he is not she and she again wants nothing to name want if want it be not that she is not he he is the half part of a blessed man left to be finished by such as she and she a fair divided excellence whose fulness of perfection lies in him o two such silver currents when they join do glorify the banks that bound them in and two such shores to two such streams made one two such controlling bounds shall you be kings to these two princes if you marry them this union shall do more than battery can to our fastclosed gates for at this match with swifter spleen than powder can enforce the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope and give you entrance but without this match the sea enraged is not half so deaf lions more confident mountains and rocks more free from motion no not death himself in moral fury half so peremptory as we to keep this city heres a stay that shakes the rotten carcass of old death out of his rags heres a large mouth indeed that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas talks as familiarly of roaring lions as maids of thirteen do of puppydogs what cannoneer begot this lusty blood he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce he gives the bastinado with his tongue our ears are cudgelld not a word of his but buffets better than a fist of france zounds i was never so bethumpd with words since i first calld my brothers father dad son list to this conjunction make this match give with our niece a dowry large enough for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie thy now unsured assurance to the crown that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit i see a yielding in the looks of france mark how they whisper urge them while their souls are capable of this ambition lest zeal now melted by the windy breath of soft petitions pity and remorse cool and congeal again to what it was why answer not the double majesties this friendly treaty of our threatend town speak england first that hath been forward first to speak unto this city what say you if that the dauphin there thy princely son can in this book of beauty read i love her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers and all that we upon this side the sea except this city now by us besieged find liable to our crown and dignity shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich in titles honours and promotions as she in beauty education blood holds hand with any princess of the world what sayst thou boy look in the ladys face i do my lord and in her eye i find a wonder or a wondrous miracle the shadow of myself formd in her eye which being but the shadow of your son becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow i do protest i never loved myself till now infixed i beheld myself drawn in the flattering table of her eye whispers with blanch drawn in the flattering table of her eye hangd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow and quarterd in her heart he doth espy himself loves traitor this is pity now that hangd and drawn and quartered there should be in such a love so vile a lout as he my uncles will in this respect is mine if he see aught in you that makes him like that any thing he sees which moves his liking i can with ease translate it to my will or if you will to speak more properly i will enforce it easily to my love further i will not flatter you my lord that all i see in you is worthy love than this that nothing do i see in you though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge that i can find should merit any hate what say these young ones what say you my niece that she is bound in honour still to do what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady nay ask me if i can refrain from love for i do love her most unfeignedly then do i give volquessen touraine maine poictiers and anjou these five provinces with her to thee and this addition more full thirty thousand marks of english coin philip of france if thou be pleased withal command thy son and daughter to join hands it likes us well

cloddy earth to glittering gold the yearly course that brings this day about shall never see it but a holiday a wicked day and not a holy day rising what hath this day deserved what hath it done that it in golden letters should be set among the high tides in the calendar nay rather turn this day out of the week this day of shame oppression perjury or if it must stand still let wives with child pray that their burthens may not fall this day lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossd but on this day let seamen fear no wreck no bargains break that are not this day made this day all things begun come to ill end yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change by heaven lady you shall have no cause to curse the fair proceedings of this day have i not pawnd to you my majesty you have beguiled me with a counterfeit resembling majesty which being touchd and tried proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood but now in arms you strengthen it with yours the grappling vigour and rough frown of war is cold in amity and painted peace and our oppression hath made up this league arm arm you heavens against these perjured kings a widow cries be husband to me heavens let not the hours of this ungodly day wear out the day in peace but ere sunset set armed discord twixt these perjured kings hear me o hear me lady constance peace war war no peace peace is to me a war o lymoges o austria thou dost shame that bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou coward thou little valiant great in villany thou ever strong upon the stronger side thou fortunes champion that dost never fight but when her humorous ladyship is by to teach thee safety thou art perjured too and soothest up greatness what a fool art thou a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear upon my party thou coldblooded slave hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side been sworn my soldier bidding me depend upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength and dost thou now fall over to my fores thou wear a lions hide doff it for shame and hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs o that a man should speak those words to me and hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs thou darest not say so villain for thy life and hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs we like not this thou dost forget thyself enter cardinal pandulph here comes the holy legate of the pope hail you anointed deputies of heaven to thee king john my holy errand is i pandulph of fair milan cardinal and from pope innocent the legate here do in his name religiously demand why thou against the church our holy mother so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce keep stephen langton chosen archbishop of canterbury from that holy see this in our foresaid holy fathers name pope innocent i do demand of thee what earthy name to interrogatories can task the free breath of a sacred king thou canst not cardinal devise a name so slight unworthy and ridiculous to charge me to an answer as the pope tell him this tale and from the mouth of england add thus much more that no italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions but as we under heaven are supreme head so under him that great supremacy where we do reign we will alone uphold without the assistance of a mortal hand so tell the pope all reverence set apart to him and his usurpd authority brother of england you blaspheme in this though you and all the kings of christendom are led so grossly by this meddling priest dreading the curse that money may buy out and by the merit of vile gold dross dust purchase corrupted pardon of a man who in that sale sells pardon from himself though you and all the rest so grossly led this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish yet i alone alone do me oppose against the pope and count his friends my foes then by the lawful power that i have thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate and blessed shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic and meritorious shall that hand be calld canonized and worshipped as a saint that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life o lawful let it be that i have room with rome to curse awhile good father cardinal cry thou amen to my keen curses for without my wrong there is no tongue hath power to curse him right theres law and warrant lady for my curse and for mine too when law can do no right let it be lawful that law bar no wrong law cannot give my child his kingdom here for he that holds his kingdom holds the law therefore since law itself is perfect wrong how can the law forbid my tongue to curse philip of france on peril of a curse let go the hand of that archheretic and raise the power of france upon his head unless he do submit himself to rome lookst thou pale france do not let go thy hand look to that devil lest that france repent and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul king philip listen to the cardinal and hang a calfsskin on his recreant limbs well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs because your breeches best may carry them philip what sayst thou to the cardinal what should he say but as the cardinal bethink you father for the difference is purchase of a heavy curse from rome or the light loss of england for a friend forego the easier thats the curse of rome o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here in likeness of a new untrimmed bride the lady constance speaks not from her faith but from her need o if thou grant my need which only lives but by the death of faith that need must needs infer this principle that faith would live again by death of need o then tread down my need and faith mounts up keep my need up and faith is trodden down the king is moved and answers not to this o be removed from him and answer well do so king philip hang no more in doubt hang nothing but a calfsskin most sweet lout i am perplexd and know not what to say what canst thou say but will perplex thee more if thou stand excommunicate and cursed good reverend father make my person yours and tell me how you would bestow yourself this royal hand and mine are newly knit and the conjunction of our inward souls married in league coupled and linked together with all religious strength of sacred vows the latest breath that gave the sound of words was deepsworn faith peace amity true love between our kingdoms and our royal selves and even before this truce but new before no longer than we well could wash our hands to clap this royal bargain up of peace heaven knows they were besmeard and overstaind with slaughters pencil where revenge did paint the fearful difference of incensed kings and shall these hands so lately purged of blood so newly joind in love so strong in both unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven make such unconstant children of ourselves as now again to snatch our palm from palm unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed of smiling peace to march a bloody host and make a riot on the gentle brow of true sincerity o holy sir my reverend father let it not be so out of your grace devise ordain impose some gentle order and then we shall be blest to do your pleasure and continue friends all form is formless order orderless save what is opposite to englands love therefore to arms be champion of our church or let the church our mother breathe her curse a mothers curse on her revolting son france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue a chafed lion by the mortal paw a fasting tiger safer by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold i may disjoin my hand but not my faith so makest thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war setst oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to heaven first be to heaven performd that is to be the champion of our church what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself and may not be performed by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirection thereby grows direct and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorched veins of one newburnd it is religion that doth make vows kept but thou hast sworn against religion by what thou swearst against the thing thou swearst and makest an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swears only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear therefore thy later vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler

constance no i defy all counsel all redress but that which ends all counsel true redress death death o amiable lovely death thou odouriferous stench sound rottenness arise forth from the couch of

not having breath to cry o that my tongue were in the thunders mouth then with a passion would i shake the world and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy which cannot hear a ladys feeble voice which scorns a modern invocation lady you utter madness and not sorrow thou art not holy to belie me so i am not mad this hair i tear is mine my name is constance i was geffreys wife young arthur is my son and he is lost i am not mad i would to heaven i were for then tis like i should forget myself o if i could what grief should i forget preach some philosophy to make me mad and thou shalt be canonized cardinal for being not mad but sensible of grief my reasonable part produces reason how i may be deliverd of these woes and teaches me to kill or hang myself if i were mad i should forget my son or madly think a babe of clouts were he i am not mad too well too well i feel the different plague of each calamity bind up those tresses o what love i note in the fair multitude of those her hairs where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends do glue themselves in sociable grief like true inseparable faithful loves sticking together in calamity to england if you will bind up your hairs yes that i will and wherefore will i do it i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud o that these hands could so redeem my son as they have given these hairs their liberty but now i envy at their liberty and will again commit them to their bonds because my poor child is a prisoner and father cardinal i have heard you say that we shall see and know our friends in heaven if that be true i shall see my boy again for since the birth of cain the first male child to him that did but yesterday suspire there was not such a gracious creature born but now will cankersorrow eat my bud and chase the native beauty from his cheek and he will look as hollow as a ghost as dim and meagre as an agues fit and so hell die and rising so again when i shall meet him in the court of heaven i shall not know him therefore never never must i behold my pretty arthur more you hold too heinous a respect of grief he talks to me that never had a son you are as fond of grief as of your child grief fills the room up of my absent child lies in his bed walks up and down with me puts on his pretty looks repeats his words remembers me of all his gracious parts stuffs out his vacant garments with his form then have i reason to be fond of grief fare you well had you such a loss as i i could give better comfort than you do i will not keep this form upon my head when there is such disorder in my wit o lord my boy my arthur my fair son my life my joy my food my all the world my widowcomfort and my sorrows cure exit i fear some outrage and ill follow her exit theres nothing in this world can make me joy life is as tedious as a twicetold tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man and bitter shame hath spoild the sweet worlds taste that it yields nought but shame and bitterness before the curing of a strong disease even in the instant of repair and health the fit is strongest evils that take leave on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day all days of glory joy and happiness if you had won it certainly you had no no when fortune means to men most good she looks upon them with a threatening eye tis strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner as heartily as he is glad he hath him your mind is all as youthful as your blood now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit for even the breath of what i mean to speak shall blow each dust each straw each little rub out of the path which shall directly lead thy foot to englands throne and therefore mark john hath seized arthur and it cannot be that whiles warm life plays in that infants veins the misplaced john should entertain an hour one minute nay one quiet breath of rest a sceptre snatchd with an unruly hand must be as boisterously maintaind as gaind and he that stands upon a slippery place makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up that john may stand then arthur needs must fall so be it for it cannot be but so but what shall i gain by young arthurs fall you in the right of lady blanch your wife may then make all the claim that arthur did and lose it life and all as arthur did how green you are and fresh in this old world john lays you plots the times conspire with you for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal that none so small advantage shall step forth to cheque his reign but they will cherish it no natural exhalation in the sky no scope of nature no distemperd day no common wind no customed event but they will pluck away his natural cause and call them meteors prodigies and signs abortives presages and tongues of heaven plainly denouncing vengeance upon john may be he will not touch young arthurs life but hold himself safe in his prisonment o sir when he shall hear of your approach if that young arthur be not gone already even at that news he dies and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers ends of john methinks i see this hurly all on foot and o what better matter breeds for you than i have named the bastard faulconbridge is now in england ransacking the church offending charity if but a dozen french were there in arms they would be as a call to train ten thousand english to their side or as a little snow tumbled about anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin go with me to the king tis wonderful what may be wrought out of their discontent now that their souls are topful of offence for england go i will whet on the king strong reasons make strong actions let us go if you say ay the king will not say no exeunt act iv scene i a room in a castle enter hubert and executioners heat me these irons hot and look thou stand within the arras when i strike my foot upon the bosom of the ground rush forth and bind the boy which you shall find with me fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch i hope your warrant will bear out the deed uncleanly scruples fear not you look tot exeunt executioners young lad come forth i have to say with you enter arthur good morrow hubert good morrow little prince as little prince having so great a title to be more prince as may be you are sad indeed i have been merrier mercy on me methinks no body should be sad but i yet i remember when i was in france young gentlemen would be as sad as night only for wantonness by my christendom so i were out of prison and kept sheep i should be as merry as the day is long and so i would be here but that i doubt my uncle practises more harm to me he is afraid of me and i of him is it my fault that i was geffreys son no indeed ist not and i would to heaven i were your son so you would love me hubert aside  if i talk to him with his innocent prate he will awake my mercy which lies dead therefore i will be sudden and dispatch are you sick hubert you look pale today in sooth i would you were a little sick that i might sit all night and watch with you i warrant i love you more than you do me aside  his words do take possession of my bosom read here young arthur showing a paper aside how now foolish rheum turning dispiteous torture out of door i must be brief lest resolution drop out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears can you not read it is it not fair writ too fairly hubert for so foul effect must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes young boy i must and will you and i will have you the heart when your head did but ache i knit my handercher about your brows the best i had a princess wrought it me and i did never ask it you again and with my hand at midnight held your head and like the watchful minutes to the hour still and anon cheerd up the heavy time saying what lack you and where lies your grief or what good love may i perform for you many a poor mans son would have lien still and neer have spoke a loving word to you but you at your sick service had a prince nay you may think my love was crafty love and call it cunning do an if you will if heaven be pleased that you must use me ill why then you must will you put out mine eyes these eyes that never did nor never shall so much as frown on you i have sworn to do it and with hot irons must i burn them out ah none but in this iron age would do it the iron of itself though heat redhot approaching near these eyes would drink my tears and quench his fiery indignation even in the matter of mine innocence nay after that consume away in rust but for containing fire to harm mine eye are you more stubbornhard than hammerd iron an if an angel should have come to me and told me hubert should put out mine eyes i would not have believed himno tongue but huberts come forth stamps reenter executioners with a cord irons  and c do as i bid you do o save me hubert save me my eyes are out even with the fierce looks of these bloody men give me the iron i say and bind him here alas what need you be so boisterousrough i will not struggle i will stand stonestill for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound nay hear me hubert drive these men away and i will sit as quiet as a lamb i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word nor look upon the iron angerly thrust but these men away and ill forgive you whatever torment you do put me to go stand within let me alone with him i am best pleased to be from such a deed exeunt executioners alas i then have chid away my friend he hath a stern look but a gentle heart let him come back that his compassion may give life to yours come boy prepare yourself is there no remedy none but to lose your eyes o heaven that there were but a mote in yours a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair any annoyance in that precious sense then feeling what small things are boisterous there your vile intent must needs seem horrible is this your promise go to hold your tongue hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert or hubert if you will cut out my tongue so i may keep mine eyes o spare mine eyes though to no use but still to look on you lo by my truth the instrument is cold and would not harm me i can heat it boy no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief being create for comfort to be used in undeserved extremes see else yourself there is no malice in this burning coal the breath of heaven has blown his spirit out and strewd repentent ashes on his head but with my breath i can revive it boy an if you do you will but make it blush and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes and like a dog that is compelld to fight snatch at his master that doth tarre him on all things that you should use to do me wrong deny their office only you do lack that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends creatures of note for mercylacking uses well see to live i will not touch thine eye for all the treasure that thine uncle owes yet am i sworn and i did purpose boy with this same very iron to burn them out o now you look like hubert all this while you were disguised peace no more adieu your uncle must not know but you are dead ill fill these dogged spies with false reports and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure that hubert for the wealth of all the world will not offend thee o heaven i thank you hubert silence no more go closely in with me much danger do i undergo for thee exeunt scene ii king johns palace enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords here once again we sit once again crownd and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes this once again but that your highness pleased was once superfluous you were crownd before and that high royalty was neer pluckd off the faiths of men neer stained with revolt fresh expectation troubled not the land with any longdfor change or better state therefore to be possessd with double pomp to guard a title that was rich before to gild refined gold to paint the lily to throw a perfume on the violet to smooth the ice or add another hue unto the rainbow or with taperlight to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish is wasteful and ridiculous excess but that your royal pleasure must be done this act is as an ancient tale new told and in the last repeating troublesome being urged at a time unseasonable in this the antique and well noted face of plain old form is much disfigured and like a shifted wind unto a sail it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about startles and frights consideration makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected for putting on so new a fashiond robe when workmen strive to do better than well they do confound their skill in covetousness and oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by the excuse as patches set upon a little breach discredit more in hiding of the fault than did the fault before it was so patchd to this effect before you were new crownd we breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness to overbear it and we are all well pleased since all and every part of what we would doth make a stand at what your highness will some reasons of this double coronation i have possessd you with and think them strong and more more strong then lesser is my fear i shall indue you with meantime but ask what you would have reformd that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests then i as one that am the tongue of these to sound the purpose of all their hearts both for myself and them but chief of all your safety for the which myself and them bend their best studies heartily request the enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint doth move the murmuring lips of discontent to break into this dangerous argument if what in rest you have in right you hold why then your fears which as they say attend the steps of wrong should move you to mew up your tender kinsman and to choke his days with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth the rich advantage of good exercise that the times enemies may not have this to grace occasions let it be our suit that you have bid us ask his liberty which for our goods we do no further ask than whereupon our weal on you depending counts it your weal he have his liberty enter hubert let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction hubert what news with you taking him apart this is the man should do the bloody deed he showd his warrant to a friend of mine the image of a wicked heinous fault lives in his eye that close aspect of his does show the mood of a much troubled breast and i do fearfully believe tis done what we so feard he had a charge to do the colour of the king doth come and go between his purpose and his conscience like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set his passion is so ripe it needs must break and when it breaks i fear will issue thence the foul corruption of a sweet childs death we cannot hold mortalitys strong hand good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceased tonight indeed we feard his sickness was past cure indeed we heard how near his death he was before the child himself felt he was sick this must be answerd either here or hence why do you bend such solemn brows on me think you i bear the shears of destiny have i commandment on the pulse of life it is apparent foul play and tis shame that greatness should so grossly offer it so thrive it in your game and so farewell stay yet lord salisbury ill go with thee and find the inheritance of this poor child his little kingdom of a forced grave that blood which owed the breadth of all this isle three foot of it doth hold bad world the while this must not be thus borne this will break out to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt exeunt lords they burn in indignation i repent there is no sure foundation set on blood no certain life achieved by others death enter a messenger a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france from france to england never such a power for any foreign preparation was levied in the body of a land the copy of your speed is learnd by them for when you should be told they do prepare the tidings come that they are all arrived o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mothers care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it my liege her ear is stoppd with dust the first of april died your noble mother and as i hear my lord the lady constance in a frenzy died three days before but this from rumours tongue i idly heard if true or false i know not withhold thy speed dreadful occasion o make a league with me till i have pleased my discontented peers what mother dead how wildly then walks my estate in france under whose conduct came those powers of france that thou for truth givest out are landed here under the dauphin thou hast made me giddy with these ill tidings enter the bastard and peter of pomfret now what says the world to your proceedings do not seek to stuff my head with more ill news for it is full but if you be afeard to hear the worst then let the worst unheard fall on your bead bear with me cousin for i was amazed under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood and can give audience to any tongue speak it of what it will how i have sped among the clergymen the sums i have collected shall express but as i travelld hither through the land i find the people strangely fantasied possessd with rumours full of idle dreams not knowing what they fear but full of fear and here a prophet that i brought with me from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found with many hundreds treading on his heels to whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes that ere the next ascensionday at noon your highness should deliver up your crown thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so foreknowing that the truth will fall out so hubert away with him imprison him and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown let him be hangd deliver him to safety and return for i must use thee exeunt hubert with peter o my gentle cousin hearst thou the news abroad who are arrived the french my lord mens mouths are full of it besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury with eyes as red as newenkindled fire and others more going to seek the grave of arthur who they say is killd tonight on your suggestion gentle kinsman go and thrust thyself into their companies i have a way to win their loves again bring them before me i will seek them out nay but make haste the better foot before o let me have no subject enemies when adverse foreigners affright my towns with dreadful pomp of stout invasion be mercury set feathers to thy heels and fly like thought from them to me again the spirit of the time shall teach me speed exit spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman go after him for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers and be thou he with all my heart my liege exit my mother dead reenter hubert my lord they say five moons were seen tonight four fixed and the fifth did whirl about the other four in wondrous motion five moons old men and beldams in the streets do prophesy upon it dangerously young arthurs death is common in their mouths and when they talk of him they shake their heads and whisper one another in the ear and he that speaks doth gripe the hearers wrist whilst he that hears makes fearful action with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool with open mouth swallowing a tailors news who with his shears and measure in his hand standing on slippers which his nimble haste had falsely thrust upon contrary feet told of a many thousand warlike french that were embattailed and rankd in kent another lean unwashd artificer cuts off his tale and talks of arthurs death why seekst thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthurs death thy hand hath murderd him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him no had my lord why did you not provoke me it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humours for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humour than advised respect here is your hand and seal for what i did o when the last account twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature markd quoted and signd to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorrd aspect finding thee fit for bloody villany apt liable to be employd in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthurs death and thou to be endeared to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince my lord hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purposed or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousins death arm you against your other enemies ill make a peace between your soul and you young arthur is alive this hand of mine is yet a maiden and an innocent hand not painted with the crimson spots of blood within this bosom never enterd yet the dreadful motion of a murderous thought and you have slanderd nature in my form which howsoever rude exteriorly is yet the cover of a fairer mind than to be butcher of an innocent child doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incensed rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast exeunt scene iii before the castle enter arthur on the walls the wall is high and yet will i leap down good ground be pitiful and hurt me not theres few or none do know me if they did this shipboys semblance hath disguised me quite i am afraid and yet ill venture it if i get down and do not break my limbs ill find a thousand shifts to get away as good to die and go as die and stay leaps down o me my uncles spirit is in these stones heaven take my soul and england keep my bones dies enter pembroke salisbury and bigot lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury it is our safety and we must embrace this gentle offer of the perilous time who brought that letter from the cardinal the count melun a noble lord of france whose private with me of the dauphins love is much more general than these lines import tomorrow morning let us meet him then or rather then set forward for twill be two long days journey lords or ere we meet enter the bastard once more today well met distemperd lords the king by me requests your presence straight the king hath dispossessd himself of us we will not line his thin bestained cloak with our pure honours nor attend the foot that leaves the print of blood whereer it walks return and tell him so we know the worst whateer you think good words i think were best our griefs and not our manners reason now but there is little reason in your grief therefore twere reason you had manners now sir sir impatience hath his privilege tis true to hurt his master no man else this is the prison what is he lies here seeing arthur o death made proud with pure and princely beauty the earth had not a hole to hide this deed murder as hating what himself hath done doth lay it open to urge on revenge or when he doomd this beauty to a grave found it too preciousprincely for a grave sir richard what think you have you beheld or have you read or heard or could you think or do you almost think although you see that you do see could thought without this object form such another this is the very top the height the crest or crest unto the crest of murders arms this is the bloodiest shame the wildest savagery the vilest stroke that ever walleyed wrath or staring rage presented to the tears of soft remorse all murders past do stand excused in this and this so sole and so unmatchable shall give a holiness a purity to the yet unbegotten sin of times and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest exampled by this heinous spectacle it is a damned and a bloody work the graceless action of a heavy hand if that it be the work of any hand if that it be the work of any hand we had a kind of light what would ensue it is the shameful work of huberts hand the practise and the purpose of the king from whose obedience i forbid my soul kneeling before this ruin of sweet life and breathing to his breathless excellence the incense of a vow a holy vow never to taste the pleasures of the world never to be infected with delight nor conversant with ease and idleness till i have set a glory to this hand by giving it the worship of revenge our souls religiously confirm thy words enter hubert lords i am hot with haste in seeking you arthur doth live the king hath sent for you o he is old and blushes not at death avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone i am no villain must i rob the law drawing his sword your sword

prince lucifer there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child upon my soul if thou didst but consent to this most cruel act do but despair and if thou wantst a cord the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself put but a little water in a spoon and it shall be as all the ocean enough to stifle such a villain up i do suspect thee very grievously if i in act consent or sin of thought be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath which was embounded in this beauteous clay let hell want pains enough to torture me i left him well go bear him in thine arms i am amazed methinks and lose my way among the thorns and dangers of this world how easy dost

be your powers show now your mended faiths and instantly return with me again to push destruction and perpetual shame out of the weak door of our fainting land straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought the dauphin rages at our very heels it seems you know not then so much as we the cardinal pandulph is within at rest who half an hour since came from the dauphin and brings from him such offers of our peace as we with honour and respect may take with purpose presently to leave this war he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinewed to our defence nay it is in a manner done already for many carriages he hath dispatchd to the seaside and put his cause and quarrel to the disposing of the cardinal with whom yourself myself and other lords if you think meet this afternoon will post to consummate this business happily let it be so and you my noble prince with other princes that may best be spared shall wait upon your fathers funeral at worcester must his body be interrd for so he willd it thither shall it then and happily may your sweet self put on the lineal state and glory of the land to whom with all submission on my knee i do bequeath my faithful services and true subjection everlastingly and the like tender of our love we make to rest without a spot for evermore i have a kind soul that would give you thanks and knows not how to do it but with tears o let us pay the time but needful woe since it hath been beforehand with our griefs this england never did nor never shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when it first did help to wound itself now these her princes are come home again come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true exeunt act i

day without the sign of your profession speak what trade art thou why sir a carpenter where is thy leather apron and thy rule what dost thou with thy best apparel on you sir what trade are you truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but as you would say a cobbler but what trade art thou answer me directly a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles what trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir i can mend you what meanest thou by that mend me thou saucy fellow why sir cobble you thou art a cobbler art thou truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but with awl i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger i recover them as proper men as ever trod upon neats leather have gone upon my handiwork but wherefore art not in thy shop today why dost thou lead these men about the streets truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home what tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariotwheels you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome knew you not pompey many a time and oft have you climbd up to walls and battlements to towers and windows yea to chimneytops your infants in your arms and there have sat the livelong day with patient expectation to see great pompey pass the streets of rome and when you saw his chariot but appear have you not made an universal shout that tiber trembled underneath her banks to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores and do you now put on your best attire and do you now cull out a holiday and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompeys blood be gone run to your houses fall upon your knees pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude go go good countrymen and for this fault assemble all the poor men of your sort draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all exeunt all the commoners see whether their basest metal be not moved they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness go you down that way towards the capitol this way will i disrobe the images if you do find them deckd with ceremonies may we do so you know it is the feast of lupercal it is no matter let no images be hung with caesars trophies ill about and drive away the vulgar from the streets so do you too where you perceive them thick these growing feathers pluckd from caesars wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness exeunt scene ii a public place flourish enter caesar antony for the course  calpurnia portia decius brutus cicero brutus  cassius and casca a great crowd following among them a soothsayer calpurnia peace ho caesar speaks calpurnia here my lord stand you directly in antonius way when he doth run his course antonius caesar my lord forget not in your speed antonius to touch calpurnia for our elders say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse i shall remember when caesar says do this it is performd set on and leave no ceremony out flourish caesar ha who calls bid every noise be still peace yet again who is it in the press that calls on me i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar speak caesar is turnd to hear beware the ides of march what man is that a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march set him before me let me see his face fellow come from the throng look upon caesar what sayst thou to me now speak once again beware the ides of march he is a dreamer let us leave him pass sennet exeunt all except brutus and cassius will you go see the order of the course not i i pray you do i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires ill leave you brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you cassius be not deceived if i have veild my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations tell me good brutus can you see your face no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this ages yoke have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laugher or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous flourish and shout what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour well honour is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winters cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roard and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone shout flourish another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heapd on caesar why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art shamed rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man when could they say till now that talkd of rome that her wide walls encompassd but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brookd the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus the games are done and caesar is returning as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today reenter caesar and his train i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossd in conference by some senators casca will tell us what the matter is antonius caesar let me have men about me that are fat sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous fear him not caesar hes not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given would he were fatter but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing such men as he be never at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be feard than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad why you were with him were you not i should not then ask casca what had chanced why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell ashouting what was the second noise for why for that too they shouted thrice what was the last cry for why for that too was the crown offered him thrice ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every puttingby mine honest neighbours shouted who offered him the crown why antony tell us the manner of it gentle casca i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crownyet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronetsand as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air but soft i pray you what did caesar swound he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless tis very like he hath the failing sickness no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man what said he when he came unto himself marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but theres no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less and after that he came thus sad away ay did cicero say any thing ay he spoke greek to what effect nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesars images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it will you sup with me tonight casca no i am promised forth will you dine with me tomorrow ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating good i will expect you do so farewell both exit what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you i will do so till then think of the world exit brutus well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humour me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure exit scene iii the same a street thunder and lightning enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero good even casca brought you caesar home why are you breathless and why stare you so are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction why saw you any thing more wonderful a common slaveyou know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches joind and yet his hand not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd besidesi ha not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace hooting and shrieking when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon indeed it is a strangedisposed time but men may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves come caesar to the capitol tomorrow he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow good night then casca this disturbed sky is not to walk in farewell cicero exit cicero enter cassius whos there a roman casca by your voice your ear is good cassius what night is this a very pleasing night to honest men who ever knew the heavens menace so those that have known the earth so full of faults for my part i have walkd about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunderstone and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fool and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous qualitywhy you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers minds are dead and we are governd with our mothers spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure thunder still so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am armd and dangers are to me indifferent you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering telltale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest theres a bargain made now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblestminded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourabledangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompeys porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favours like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible stand close awhile for here comes one in haste tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend enter cinna cinna where haste you so to find out you whos that metellus cimber no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts am i not stayd for cinna i am glad on t what a fearful night is this theres two or three of us have seen strange sights am i not stayd for tell me yes you are o cassius if you could but win the noble brutus to our party be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetors chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus statue all this done repair to pompeys porch where you shall find us is decius brutus and trebonius there all but metellus cimber and hes gone to seek you at your house well i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me that done repair to pompeys theatre exit cinna come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours o he sits high in all the peoples hearts and that which would appear offence in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him exeunt act ii scene i rome brutuss orchard enter brutus what lucius ho i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly when lucius when awake i say what lucius enter lucius calld you my lord get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here i will my lord exit it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crownd how that might change his nature theres the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown himthat and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayd more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climberupward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell reenter lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seald up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed gives him the letter get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march i know not sir look in the calendar and bring me word i will sir exit the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them opens the letter and reads brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself shall rome  and c speak strike redress brutus thou sleepst awake such instigations have been often droppd where i have took them up shall rome  and c thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one mans awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was calld a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus reenter lucius sir march is wasted fourteen days knocking within tis good go to the gate somebody knocks exit lucius since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection reenter lucius sir tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you is he alone no sir there are moe with him do you know them no sir their hats are pluckd about their ears and half their faces buried in their cloaks that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour let em enter exit lucius they are the faction o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention enter the conspirators cassius casca decius brutus cinna metellus cimber and trebonius i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you yes every man of them and no man here but honours you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius he is welcome hither this decius brutus he is welcome too this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night shall i entreat a word brutus and cassius whisper here lies the east doth not the day break here no o pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day you shall confess that you are both deceived here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here give me your hands all over one by one and let us swear our resolution no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the times abuse if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let highsighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passd from him but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us let us not leave him out no by no means o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy mens voices to commend our deeds it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands our youths and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow any thing that other men begin then leave him out indeed he is not fit shall no man else be touchd but only caesar decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesars spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be calld purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesars arm when caesars head is off yet i fear him for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter clock strikes peace count the clock the clock hath stricken three tis time to part but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustomd terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today never fear that if he be so resolved i can oersway him for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betrayd with trees and bears with glasses elephants with holes lions with toils and men with flatterers but when i tell him he hates flatterers he says he does being then most flattered let me work for i can give his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol nay we will all of us be there to fetch him by the eighth hour is that the uttermost be that the uttermost and fail not then caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and ill fashion him the morning comes upon s well leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy and so good morrow to you every one exeunt all but brutus boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleepst so sound enter portia brutus my lord portia what mean you wherefore rise you now it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning nor for yours neither youve ungently brutus stole from my bed and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose and walkd about musing and sighing with your arms across and when i askd you what the matter was you stared upon me with ungentle looks i urged you further then you scratchd your head and too impatiently stampd with your foot yet i insisted yet you answerd not but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you so i did fearing to strengthen that impatience which seemd too much enkindled and withal hoping it was but an effect of humour which sometime hath his hour with every man it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep and could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevaild on your condition i should not know you brutus dear my lord make me acquainted with your cause of grief i am not well in health and that is all brutus is wise and were he not in health he would embrace the means to come by it why so i do good portia go to bed is brutus sick and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning what is brutus sick and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness no my brutus you have some sick offence within your mind which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of and upon my knees i charm you by my oncecommended beauty by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one that you unfold to me yourself your half why you are heavy and what men tonight have had to resort to you for here have been some six or seven who did hide their faces even from darkness kneel not gentle portia i should not need if you were gentle brutus within the bond of marriage tell me brutus is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you am i yourself but as it were in sort or limitation to keep with you at meals comfort your bed and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure if it be no more portia is brutus harlot not his wife you are my true and honourable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart if this were true then should i know this secret i grant i am a woman but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife i grant i am a woman but withal a woman wellreputed catos daughter think you i am no stronger than my sex being so fatherd and so husbanded tell me your counsels i will not disclose em i have made strong proof of my constancy giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh can i bear that with patience and not my husbands secrets o ye gods render me worthy of this noble wife knocking within hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows leave me with haste exit portia lucius whos that knocks reenter lucius with ligarius he is a sick man that would speak with you caius ligarius that metellus spake of boy stand aside caius ligarius how vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief would you were not sick i am not sick if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honour such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it by all the gods that romans bow before i here discard my sickness soul of rome brave son derived from honourable loins thou like an exorcist hast conjured up my mortified spirit now bid me run and i will strive with things impossible yea get the better of them whats to do a piece of work that will make sick men whole but are not some whole that we must make sick that must we also what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done set on your foot and with a heart newfired i follow you to do i know not what but it sufficeth that brutus leads me on follow me then exeunt scene ii caesars house thunder and lightning enter caesar in his nightgown nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out help ho they murder caesar whos within enter a servant my lord go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success i will my lord exit enter calpurnia what mean you caesar think you to walk forth you shall not stir out of your house today caesar shall forth the things that threatend me neer lookd but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanished caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch a lioness hath whelped in the streets and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets o caesar these things are beyond all use and i do fear them what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come reenter servant what say the augurers they would not have you to stir forth today plucking the entrails of an offering forth they could not find a heart within the beast the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear no caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions litterd in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth alas my lord your wisdom is consumed in confidence do not go forth today call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own well send mark antony to the senatehouse and he shall say you are not well today let me upon my knee prevail in this mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humour i will stay at home enter decius brutus heres decius brutus he shall tell them so caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar i come to fetch you to the senatehouse and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today cannot is false and that i dare not falser i will not come today tell them so decius say he is sick shall caesar send a lie have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth decius go tell them caesar will not come most mighty caesar let me know some cause lest i be laughd at when i tell them so the cause is in my will i will not come that is enough to satisfy the senate but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know calpurnia here my wife stays me at home she dreamt tonight she saw my statua which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath beggd that i will stay at home today this dream is all amiss interpreted it was a vision fair and fortunate your statue spouting blood in many pipes in which so many smiling romans bathed signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood and that great men shall press for tinctures stains relics and cognizance this by calpurnias dream is signified and this way have you well expounded it i have when you have heard what i can say and know it now the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar if you shall send them word you will not come their minds may change besides it were a mock apt to be renderd for some one to say break up the senate till another time when caesars wife shall meet with better dreams if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper lo caesar is afraid pardon me caesar for my dear dear love to our proceeding bids me tell you this and reason to my love is liable how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia i am ashamed i did yield to them give me my robe for i will go enter publius brutus ligarius metellus casca trebonius and cinna and look where publius is come to fetch me good morrow caesar welcome publius what brutus are you stirrd so early too good morrow casca caius ligarius caesar was neer so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean

along and as a suitor will i give him this my heart laments that virtue cannot live out of the teeth of emulation if thou read this o caesar thou mayst live if not the fates with traitors do contrive

it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear me i shall beseech him to befriend himself why knowst thou any harms intended towards him none that i know will be much that i fear may chance good morrow to you here the street is narrow the throng that follows caesar at the heels of senators of praetors common suitors will crowd a feeble man almost to death ill get me to a place more void and there speak to great caesar as he comes along exit i must go in ay me how weak a thing the heart of woman is o brutus the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise sure the boy heard me brutus hath a suit that caesar will not grant o i grow faint run lucius and commend me to my lord say i am merry come to me again and bring me word what he doth say to thee exeunt severally act iii scene i rome

prefer his suit to caesar he is addressd press near and second him casca you are the first that rears your hand are we all ready what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress most high most mighty and most puissant caesar metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart kneeling i must prevent thee cimber these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawd from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning thy brother by decree is banished if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied is there no voice more worthy than my own to sound more sweetly in great caesars ear for the repealing of my banishd brother i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal what brutus pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber i could be well moved if i were as you if i could pray to move prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star of whose truefixd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament the skies are painted with unnumberd sparks they are all fire and every one doth shine but theres but one in all doth hold his place so in the world tis furnishd well with men and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank unshaked of motion and that i am he let me a little show it even in this that i was constant cimber should be banishd and constant do remain to keep him so o caesar hence wilt thou lift up olympus great caesar doth not brutus bootless kneel speak hands for me casca first then the other conspirators and brutus stab caesar et tu brute then fall caesar dies liberty freedom tyranny is dead run hence proclaim cry it about the streets some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand stiff ambitions debt is paid go to the pulpit brutus and cassius too wheres publius here quite confounded with this mutiny stand fast together lest some friend of caesars should chance talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers reenter trebonius where is antony fled to his house amazed men wives and children stare cry out and run as it were doomsday fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesars friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesars blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons oer our heads lets all cry peace freedom and liberty stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompeys basis lies along no worthier than the dust so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be calld the men that gave their country liberty what shall we forth ay every man away brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome enter a servant soft who comes here a friend of antonys thus brutus did my master bid me kneel thus did mark antony bid me fall down and being prostrate thus he bade me say brutus is noble wise valiant and honest caesar was mighty bold royal and loving say i love brutus and i honour him say i feard caesar honourd him and loved him if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him and be resolved how caesar hath deserved to lie in death mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith so says my master antony thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell

curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarterd with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesars spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarchs voice cry  havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial enter a servant you serve octavius caesar do you not i do mark antony caesar did write for him to come to rome he did receive his letters and is coming and bid me say to you by word of mouth o caesar seeing the body thy heart

brutus is ascended silence be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesars to him i say that brutus love to caesar was no less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply none brutus none then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforced for which he suffered death enter antony and others with caesars body here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i departthat as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death live

into the public chair well hear him noble antony go up for brutus sake i am beholding to you goes into the pulpit what does he say of brutus he says for brutus sake he finds himself beholding to us all twere best he speak no harm of brutus here this caesar was a tyrant nay thats certain we are blest that rome is rid of him peace let us hear what antony can say you gentle romans peace ho let us hear him friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answerd it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men come i to speak in caesars funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me methinks there is much reason in his sayings if thou consider rightly of the matter caesar has had great wrong has he masters i fear there will a worse come in his place markd ye his words he would not take the crown therefore tis certain he was not ambitious if it be found so some will dear abide it poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping theres not a nobler man in rome than antony now mark him he begins again to speak but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honourable men but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue well hear the will read it mark antony the will the will we will hear caesars will have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men bearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it read the will well hear it antony you shall read us the will caesars will will you be patient will you stay awhile i have oershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honourable men whose daggers have stabbd caesar i do fear it they were traitors honourable men the will the testament they were villains murderers the will read the will you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave come down descend you shall have leave antony comes down a ring stand round stand from

made through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd and as he pluckd his cursed steel away mark how the blood of caesar followd it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knockd or no for brutus as you know was caesars angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompeys statua which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourishd over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what

received you let me be resolved with courtesy and with respect enough but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath used of old thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforced ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial comes his army on they mean this night in sardis to be

noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man were slighted off you wronged yourself to write in such a case in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offence should bear his comment let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemnd to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers i an itching palm you know that you are brutus that speak this or by the gods this speech were else your last the name of cassius honours this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head chastisement remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice sake what villain touchd his body that did stab and not for justice what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman brutus bay not me ill not endure it you forget yourself to hedge me in i am a soldier i older in practise abler than yourself to make conditions go to you are not cassius i am i say you are not urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no further away slight man ist possible hear me for i will speak

choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble must i budge must i observe you must i stand and crouch under your testy humour by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish is it come to this you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better if you did i care not when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me peace peace you durst not so have tempted him i durst not no what durst not tempt him for your life you durst not do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answerd caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces i denied you not you did i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friends infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are i do not till you practise them on me you love me not i do not like your faults a friendly eye could never see such faults a flatterers would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world hated by one he loves braved by his brother chequed like a bondman all his faults observed set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote to cast into my teeth o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutus mine richer than gold if that thou best a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonour shall be humour o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him when i spoke that i was illtemperd too do you confess so much give me your hand and my heart too o brutus whats the matter have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humour which my mother gave me makes me forgetful yes cassius and from henceforth when you are overearnest with your brutus hell think your mother chides and leave you so within  let me go in to see the generals there is some grudge between em tis not meet they be alone within  you shall not come to them within  nothing but death shall stay me enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius how now whats the matter for shame you generals what do you mean love and be friends as two such men should be for i have seen more years im sure than ye ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence bear with him brutus tis his fashion ill know his humour when he knows his

proscription had you your letters from your wife my lord no messala nor nothing in your letters writ of her nothing messala that methinks is strange why ask you hear you aught of her in yours no my

once i have the patience to endure it now even so great men great losses should endure i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so well to our work alive what do you think of marching to philippi presently i do not think it good your reason this it is tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offence whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness good reasons must of force give place to better the people twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refreshd newadded and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him

give good words witness the hole you made in caesars heart crying long live hail caesar antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless not stingless too o yes and soundless too for you have stoln their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting villains you did not so when your vile daggers hackd one another in the sides of caesar you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers flatterers now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have ruled come come the cause if arguing make us sweat the proof of it will turn to redder drops look i draw a sword against conspirators when think you that the sword goes up again never till caesars three and thirty wounds be well avenged or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands unless thou bringst them with thee so i hope i was not born to die on brutus sword o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honourable a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour joind with a masker and a reveller old cassius still come antony away defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth if you dare fight today come to the field if not when you have stomachs exeunt octavius antony and their army why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark the storm is up and all is on the hazard ho lucilius hark a word with you standing forthmy lord brutus and lucilius converse apart messala standing forth  what says my general messala this is my birthday as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compelld to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly oer our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost believe not so i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly even so lucilius now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rest still incertain lets reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take for ever and for ever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made for ever and for ever farewell brutus if we do meet again well smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away exeunt scene ii the same the field of battle alarum enter

my lord of burgundy we first address towards you who with this king hath rivalld for our daughter what in the least will you require in present dower with her or cease your quest of love most royal majesty i crave no more than what your highness offerd nor will you tender less right noble burgundy when she was dear to us we did hold her so but now her price is falln sir there she stands if aught

by the power that made me i tell you all her wealth to king of france for you great king i would not from your love make such a stray to match you where i hate therefore beseech you to avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers this is most strange that she that even but now was your best object the argument of your praise balm of your age most best most dearest should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle so many folds of favour sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or your forevouchd affection falln into taint which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle could never plant in me i yet beseech your majesty if for i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not since what i well intend ill dot before i speakthat you make known it is no vicious blot murder or foulness no unchaste action or dishonourd step that hath deprived me of your grace and favour but even for want of that for which i am richer a stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue as i am glad i have not though not to have it hath lost me in your liking better thou hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better is it but thisa tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do my lord of burgundy what say you to the lady loves not love when it is mingled with regards that stand aloof from the entire point will you have her she is herself a dowry royal lear give but that portion which yourself proposed and here i take cordelia

what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of longengraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kents banishment there is further compliment of leavetaking between france and him pray you lets hit together if our father carry authority with such dispositions

with me my fellowscholars and to keep those statutes that are recorded in this schedule here your oaths are passd and now subscribe your names that his own hand may strike his honour down that violates the smallest branch herein if you are armd to do as sworn to do subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too i am resolved tis but a three years fast the mind shall banquet though the body pine fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits my loving lord dumain is mortified the grosser manner of these worlds delights he throws upon the gross worlds baser slaves to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die with all these living in philosophy i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep your oath is passd to pass away from these let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years space you swore to that biron and to the rest by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest what is the end of study let me know why that to know which else we should not know things hid and barrd you mean from common sense ay that is studys godlike recompense come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thusto study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if studys gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will neer say no these be the stops that hinder study quite and train our intellects to vain delight why all delights are vain but that most vain which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heavens glorious sun that will not be deepsearchd with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heavens lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name how well hes read to reason against reading proceeded well to stop all good proceeding he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding the spring is near when green geese are abreeding how follows that fit in his place and time in reason nothing something then in rhyme biron is like an envious sneaping frost that bites the firstborn infants of the spring well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing why should i joy in any abortive birth at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in mays newfangled mirth but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb oer the house to unlock the little gate well sit you out go home biron adieu no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say yet confident ill keep what i have swore and bide the penance of each three years day give me the paper let me read the same and to the strictst decrees ill write my name how well this yielding rescues thee from shame reads  item that no woman shall come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimed four days ago lets see the penalty reads on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty marry that did i sweet lord and why to fright them hence with that dread penalty a dangerous law against gentility reads item if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise this article my liege yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french kings daughter with yourself to speak a maid of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain or vainly comes the admired princess hither what say you lords why this was quite forgot so study evermore is overshot while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should and when it hath the thing it hunteth most tis won as towns with fire so won so lost we must of force dispense with this decree she must lie here on mere necessity necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years space for every man with his affects is born not by might masterd but by special grace if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity so to the laws at large i write my name subscribes and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame suggestions are to other as to me but i believe although i seem so loath i am the last that will last keep his oath but is there no quick recreation granted ay that there is our court you know is haunted with a refined traveller of spain a man in all the worlds new fashion planted that hath a mint of phrases in his brain one whom the music of his own vain tongue doth ravish like enchanting harmony a man of complements whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny this child of fancy that armado hight for interim to our studies shall relate in highborn words the worth of many a knight from

sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn what did these rent lines show some love of thine did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of inde at the first opening of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eaglesighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty what zeal what fury hath inspired thee now my love her mistress is a gracious moon she an attending star scarce seen a light my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the culld sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a sellers praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a witherd hermit fivescore winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if newborn and gives the crutch the cradles infancy o tis the sun that maketh all things shine by heaven thy love is black as ebony is ebony like her o wood divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black o paradox black is the badge of hell the hue of dungeons and the suit of night and beautys crest becomes the heavens well devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my ladys brows be deckd it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow to look like her are chimneysweepers black and since her time are colliers counted bright and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack dark needs no candles now for dark is light your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be washd away twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain ill find a fairer face not washd today ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here no devil will fright thee then so much as she i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear look heres thy love my foot and her face see o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread o vile then as she goes what upward lies the street should see as she walkd overhead but what of this are we not all in love nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn then leave this chat and good biron now prove our loving lawful and our faith not torn ay marry there some flattery for this evil o some authority how to proceed some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil some salve for perjury tis more than need have at you then affections men at arms consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you have vowd to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of studys excellence without the beauty of a womans face from womens eyes this doctrine i derive  they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and longduring action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not looking on a womans face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is any author in the world teaches such beauty as a womans eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beautys tutors have enrichd you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a ladys eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lovers ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stoppd loves feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockld snails loves tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollos lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temperd with loves sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdoms sake a word that all men love or for loves sake a word that loves all men or for mens sake the authors of these women or womens sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity saint cupid then and soldiers to the field advance your standards and upon them lords pellmell down with them but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them now to plaindealing lay these glozes by shall we resolve to woo these girls of france and win them too therefore let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents first from the park let us conduct them thither

wisdoms warrant and the help of school and wits own grace to grace a learned fool the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravitys revolt to wantonness folly in fools bears not so strong a note as foolery in the wise when wit doth dote since all the power thereof it doth apply to prove by wit worth in simplicity here comes boyet and mirth is in his face enter boyet o i am stabbd with laughter wheres her grace thy news boyet prepare madam prepare arm wenches arm encounters mounted are against your peace love doth approach disguised armed in arguments youll be surprised muster your wits stand in your own defence or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence saint denis to saint cupid what are they that charge their breath against us say scout say under the cool shade of a sycamore i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour when lo to interrupt my purposed rest toward that shade i might behold addrest the king and his companions warily i stole into a neighbour thicket by and overheard what you shall overhear that by and by disguised they will be here their herald is a pretty knavish page that well by heart hath connd his embassage action and accent did they teach him there thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear and ever and anon they made a doubt presence majestical would put him out for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see yet fear not thou but speak audaciously the boy replied an angel is not evil i should have feard her had she been a devil with that all laughd and clappd him on the shoulder making the bold wag by their praises bolder one rubbd his elbow thus and fleerd and swore a better speech was never spoke before another with his finger and his thumb cried via we will dot come what will come the third he caperd and cried all goes well the fourth turnd on the toe and down he fell with that they all did tumble on the ground with such a zealous laughter so profound that in this spleen ridiculous appears to cheque their folly passions solemn tears but what but what come they to visit us they do they do and are apparelld thus like muscovites or russians as i guess their purpose is to parle to court and dance and every one his lovefeat will advance unto his several mistress which theyll know by favours several which they did bestow and will they so the gallants shall be taskd for ladies we shall every one be maskd and not a man of them shall have the grace despite of suit to see a ladys face hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear and then the king will court thee for his dear hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine so shall biron take me for rosaline and change your favours too so shall your loves woo contrary deceived by these removes come on then wear the favours most in sight but in this changing what is your intent the effect of my intent is to cross theirs they do it but in mocking merriment and mock for mock is only my intent their several counsels they unbosom shall to loves mistook and so be mockd withal upon the next occasion that we meet with visages displayed to talk and greet but shall we dance if they desire tot no to the death we will not move a foot nor to their pennd speech render we no grace but while tis spoke each turn away her face why that contempt will kill the speakers heart and quite divorce his memory from his part therefore i do it and i make no

and entreat out of a newsad soul that you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits if overboldly we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath your gentleness was guilty of it farewell worthy lord a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue excuse me so coming too short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtaind the extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed and often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate and though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love the holy suit which fain it would convince yet since loves argument was first on foot let not the cloud of sorrow justle it from what it purposed since to wail friends lost is not by much so wholesomeprofitable as to rejoice at friends but newly found i understand you not my griefs are double honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief and by these badges understand the king for your fair sakes have we neglected time playd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies hath much deformd us fashioning our humours even to the opposed end of our intents and what in us hath seemd ridiculous as love is full of unbefitting strains all wanton as a child skipping and vain formd by the eye and therefore like the eye full of strange shapes of habits and of forms varying in subjects as the eye doth roll to every varied object in his glance which particoated presence of loose love put on by us if in your heavenly eyes have misbecomed our oaths and gravities those heavenly eyes that look into these faults suggested us to make therefore ladies our love being yours the error that love makes is likewise yours we to ourselves prove false by being once false for ever to be true to those that make us bothfair ladies you and even that falsehood in itself a sin thus purifies itself and turns to grace we have received your letters full of love your favours the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been and therefore met your loves in their own fashion like a merriment our letters madam showd much more than jest so did our looks we did not quote them so now at the latest minute of the hour grant us your loves a time methinks too short to make a worldwithoutend bargain in no no my lord your grace is perjured much full of dear guiltiness and therefore this if for my love as there is no such cause you will do aught this shall you do for me your oath i will not trust but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage remote from all the pleasures of the world there stay until the twelve celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love but that it bear this trial and last love then at the expiration of the year come challenge me challenge me by these deserts and by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine and till that

and yelld out like syllable of dolour what i believe ill wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will what you have spoke it may be so perchance this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well he hath not touchd you yet i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god i am not treacherous but macbeth is a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge but i shall crave your pardon that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose angels are bright still though the brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so i have lost my hopes perchance even there where i did find my doubts why in that rawness left you wife and child those precious motives those strong knots of love without leavetaking i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonours but mine own safeties you may be rightly just whatever i shall think bleed bleed poor country great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure for goodness dare not cheque thee wear thou thy wrongs the title is affeerd fare thee well lord i would not be the villain that thou thinkst for the whole space thats in the tyrants grasp and the rich east to boot be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you i think our country sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash is added to her wounds i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but for all this when i shall tread upon the tyrants head or wear it on my sword yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before more suffer and more sundry ways than ever by him that shall succeed what should he be it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that when they shall be opend black macbeth will seem as pure as snow and the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compared with my confineless harms not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd in evils to top macbeth i grant him bloody luxurious avaricious false deceitful sudden malicious smacking of every sin that has a name but theres no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would oerbear that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink we have willing dames enough there cannot be that vulture in you to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves finding it so inclined with this there grows in my most illcomposed affection such a stanchless avarice that were i king i should cut off the nobles for their lands desire his jewels and this others house and my morehaving would be as a sauce to make me hunger more that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal destroying them for wealth this avarice sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root than summerseeming lust and it hath been the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear scotland hath foisons to fill up your will of your mere own all these are portable with other graces weighd but i have none the kingbecoming graces as justice verity temperance stableness bounty perseverance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude i have no relish of them but abound in the division of each several crime acting it many ways nay had i power i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell uproar the universal peace confound all unity on earth o scotland scotland if such a one be fit to govern speak i am as i have spoken fit to govern no not to live o nation miserable with an untitled tyrant bloodyscepterd when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again since that the truest issue of thy throne by his own interdiction stands accursed and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee oftener upon her knees than on her feet died every day she lived fare thee well these evils thou repeatst upon thyself have banishd me from scotland o my breast thy hope ends here macduff this noble passion child of integrity hath from my soul wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honour devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power and modest wisdom plucks me from overcredulous haste but god above deal between thee and me for even now i put myself to thy direction and unspeak mine own detraction here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself for strangers to my nature i am yet unknown to woman never was forsworn

enter angelo always obedient to your graces will i come to know your pleasure angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to the observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touchd but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines

commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal theres not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace i never heard any soldier dislike it i believe thee for i think thou never wast where grace was said no a dozen times at least what in metre in any proportion or in any language i think or in any religion ay why not grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace well there went but a pair of shears between us i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the list and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thourt a threepiled piece i warrant thee i had as lief be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a french velvet do i speak feelingly now i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee i think i have done myself wrong have i not yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free behold behold where madam mitigation comes i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to to what i pray judge to three thousand dolours a year ay and more a french crown more thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error i am sound nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee enter mistress overdone how now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica well well theres one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all whos that i pray thee marry sir thats claudio signior claudio claudio to prison tis not so nay but i know tis so i saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopped off but after all this fooling i would not have it so art thou sure of this i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam julietta with child believe me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promisekeeping besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose but most of all agreeing with the proclamation away lets go learn the truth of it exeunt lucio and gentlemen thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty i am customshrunk enter pompey how now whats the news with you yonder man is carried to prison well what has he done a woman but whats his offence groping for trouts in a peculiar river what is there a maid with child by him no but theres a woman with maid by him you have not heard of the proclamation have you what proclamation man all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down and what shall become of those in the city they shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down to the ground mistress why heres a change indeed in the commonwealth what shall become of me come fear you not good counsellors lack no clients though you change your place you need not change your trade ill be your tapster still courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered whats to do here thomas tapster lets withdraw here comes signior claudio led by the provost to prison and theres madam juliet exeunt enter provost claudio juliet and officers fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world bear me to prison where i am committed i do it not in evil disposition but from lord angelo by special charge thus can the demigod authority make us pay down for our offence by weight the words of heaven on whom it will it will on whom it will not so yet still tis just reenter lucio and two gentlemen why how now claudio whence comes this restraint from too much liberty my lucio liberty as surfeit is the father of much fast so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint our natures do pursue like rats that ravin down their proper bane a thirsty evil and when we drink we die if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment whats thy offence claudio what but to speak of would offend again what ist murder no lechery call it so away sir you must go one word good friend lucio a word with you a hundred if theyll do you any good is lechery so lookd after thus stands it with me upon a true contract i got possession of juliettas bed you know the lady she is fast my wife save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order this we came not to only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet with child perhaps unhappily even so and the new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his emmence that fills it up i stagger inbut this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscourd armour hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me tis surely for a name i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to him i have done so but hes not to be found i prithee lucio do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as move men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of ticktack ill to her i thank you good friend lucio within two hours come officer away exeunt scene iii a monastery enter duke vincentio and friar thomas no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth may your grace speak of it my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps i have deliverd to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travelld to poland for so i have strewd it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this gladly my lord we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this nineteen years we have let slip even like an oergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their childrens sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum it rested in your grace to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased and it in you more dreadful would have seemd than in lord angelo i do fear too dreadful sith twas my fault to give the people scope twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in the ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be exeunt scene iv a nunnery enter isabella and francisca and have you nuns no farther privileges are not these large enough yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more

bring me to the sight of isabella a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio why her unhappy brother let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you not to be weary with you hes in prison woe me for what for that which if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child sir make me not your story it is true i would notthough tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so i hold you as a thing enskyd and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talkd with in sincerity as with a saint you do blaspheme the good in mocking me do not believe it fewness and truth tis thus your brother and his lover have embraced as those that feed grow full as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry some one with child by him my cousin juliet is she your cousin adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names by vain though apt affection she it is o let him marry her this is the point the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givingsout were of an infinite distance from his truemeant design upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snowbroth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast heto give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lionshath pickd out an act under whose heavy sense your brothers life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and thats my pith of business twixt you and your poor brother doth he so seek his life has censured him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for his execution alas what poor abilitys in me to do him good assay the power you have my power alas i doubt our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them ill see what i can do but speedily i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at

him spare him hes not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offence theres many have committed it aside to isabella           ay well said the law hath not been dead though it hath slept those many had not dared to do that evil if the first that did the edict infringe had answerd for his deed now tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils either new or by remissness newconceived and so in progress to be hatchd and born are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end yet show some pity i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismissd offence would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another be satisfied your brother dies tomorrow be content so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant aside to isabella   thats well said could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would neer be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splitst the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man drest in a little brief authority most ignorant of what hes most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal aside to isabella  o to him to him wench he will relent hes coming i perceive t aside  pray heaven she win him we cannot weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation thourt i the right girl more o that that in the captains but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy aside to isabella  art avised o that more on t why do you put these sayings upon me because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know thats like my brothers fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brothers life aside                  she speaks and tis such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well gentle my lord turn back i will bethink me come again tomorrow hark how ill bribe you good my lord turn back how bribe me ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you aside to isabella  you had marrd all else not with fond shekels of the tested gold or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal well come to me tomorrow aside to isabella  go to tis well away heaven keep your honour safe asideamen for i am that way going to temptation where prayers cross at what hour tomorrow shall i attend your lordship at any time fore noon save your honour exeunt isabella lucio and provost from thee even from thy virtue whats this whats this is this her fault or mine the tempter or the tempted who sins most ha not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than womans lightness having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie what dost thou or what art thou angelo dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good o let her brother live thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what ist i dream on o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigour art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite even till now when men were fond i smiled and wonderd how exit scene iii a room in a prison enter severally duke vincentio disguised as a friar and provost hail to you provost so i think you are i am the provost whats your will good friar bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly i would do more than that if more were needful enter juliet look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blisterd her report she is with child and he that got it sentenced a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this when must he die as i do think tomorrow i have provided for you stay awhile to juliet and you shall be conducted repent you fair one of the sin you carry i do and bear the shame most patiently ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on ill gladly learn love you the man that wrongd you yes as i love the woman that wrongd him so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed mutually then was your sin of heavier kind than his i do confess it and repent it father tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear i do repent me as it is an evil and take the shame with joy there rest your partner as i hear must die tomorrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite exit must die tomorrow o injurious love that respites me a life whose very comfort is still a dying horror tis pity of him exeunt scene iv a room in angelos house enter angelo when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown feard and tedious yea my gravity whereinlet no man hear mei take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood lets write good angel on the devils horn tis not the devils crest enter a servant how now whos there one isabel a sister desires access to you teach her the way exit servant o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a wellwishd king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence enter isabella how now fair maid i am come to know your pleasure that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what tis your brother cannot live even so heaven keep your honour yet may he live awhile and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die under your sentence yea when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not ha fie these filthy vices it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one tis set down so in heaven but not in earth say you so then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather that the most just law now took your brothers life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath staind sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul i talk not of your soul our compelld sins stand more for number than for accompt how say you nay ill not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brothers life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brothers life please you to dot ill take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity pleased you to dot at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin ill make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so craftily and thats not good let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could displayd but mark me to be received plain ill speak more gross your brother is to die so and his offence is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain true admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of questionthat you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the allbuilding law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips ild wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere ild yield my body up to shame then must your brother die and twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slanderd so ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption you seemd of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love we are all frail else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness nay women are frail too ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are that is a woman if you be more youre none if you be one as you are well expressd by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destined livery i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language plainly conceive i love you my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it he shall not isabel if you give me love i know your virtue hath a licence int which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose ha little honour to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look fort sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretchd throat ill tell the world aloud what man thou art who will believe thee isabel my unsoild name the austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i the state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow or by the affection that now guides me most ill prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false oerweighs your true exit to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make courtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to the appetite to follow as it draws ill to my brother though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks held yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorrd pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity ill tell him yet of angelos request and fit his mind to death for his souls rest exit act iii scene i a room in the prison enter duke vincentio disguised as before claudio and provost so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo the miserable have no other medicine but only hope ive hope to live and am prepared to die be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keepst hourly afflict merely thou art deaths fool for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun and yet runnst toward him still thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou bearst are nursed by baseness thourt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fearst thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou existst on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forgetst thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thourt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bears thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an afterdinners sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant whats yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even i humbly thank you to sue to live i find i seek to die and seeking death find life let it come on within  what ho peace here grace and good company whos there come in the wish deserves a welcome dear sir ere long ill visit you again most holy sir i thank you enter isabella my business is a word or two with claudio and very welcome look signior heres your sister provost a word with you as many as you please bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed exeunt duke vincentio and provost now sister whats the comfort why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed tomorrow you set on is there no remedy none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain but is there any yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if youll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death perpetual durance ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the worlds vastidity you had to a determined scope but in what nature in such a one as you consenting tot would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked let me know the point o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour darest thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies why give you me this shame think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms there spake my brother there my fathers grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outwardsainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell the prenzie angelo o tis the cunning livery of hell the damnedst body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed o heavens it cannot be yes he would givet thee from this rank offence so to offend him still this nights the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest tomorrow thou shalt not dot o were it but my life ild throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin thanks dear isabel be ready claudio for your death tomorrow yes has he affections in him that thus can make him bite the law by the nose when he would force it sure it is no sin or of the deadly seven it is the least which is the least if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined o isabel what says my brother death is a fearful thing and shamed life a hateful ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling region of thickribbed ice to be imprisond in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling tis too horrible the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death alas alas sweet sister let me live what sin you do to save a brothers life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice ist not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sisters shame what should i think heaven shield my mother playd my father fair for such a warped slip of wilderness neer issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee nay hear me isabel o fie fie fie thy sins not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd tis best thou diest quickly o hear me isabella reenter duke vincentio vouchsafe a word young sister but one word what is your will might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile walks apart son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it hold you there farewell exit claudio provost a word with you reenter provost whats your will father that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company in good time exit provost isabella comes forward the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea i have heard of the lady and good words went with

think you i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to t he does well in t a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar it is too general a vice and severity must cure it yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think you how should he be made then some report a seamaid spawned him some that he was begot between two stockfishes but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a motion generative thats infallible you are pleasant sir and speak apace why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man would the duke that is absent have done this ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way o sir you are deceived tis not possible who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish the duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too that let me inform you you do him wrong surely sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing what i prithee might be the cause no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise wise why no question but he was a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringingsforth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice sir i know him and i love him love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love come sir i know what i know i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name sir my name is lucio well known to the duke he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you i fear you not o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm youll forswear this again ill be hanged first thou art deceived in me friar but no more of this canst thou tell if claudio die tomorrow or no why should he die sir why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would the duke we talk of were returned again the ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his houseeaves because they are lecherous the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays hes not past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that i said so

gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness what news abroad i the world none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every days news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke one that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself what pleasure was he given to rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed justice if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well peace be with you exeunt

none since the curfew rung not isabel no they will then eret be long what comfort is for claudio theres some in hope it is a bitter deputy not so not so his life is paralleld even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he meald with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so hes just knocking within now are they come exit provost this is a gentle provost seldom when the steeled gaoler is the friend of men knocking within how now what noise that spirits possessed with haste that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes reenter provost there he must stay until the officer arise to let him in he is calld up have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die tomorrow none sir none as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning happily you something know yet i believe there comes no countermand no such example have we besides upon the very siege of justice lord angelo hath to the public ear professd the contrary enter a messenger this is his lordships man and here comes claudios pardon giving a paper my lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other circumstance good morrow for as i take it it is almost day i shall obey him exit messenger aside  this is his pardon purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offence his quick celerity when it is born in high authority when vice makes mercy mercys so extended that for the faults love is the offender friended now sir what news i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before pray you lets hear reads whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction let me have claudios head sent me by five let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril what say you to this sir what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof it is now apparent most manifest and not denied by himself hath he born himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal he wants advice he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy pray sir in what in the delaying death a lack how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo i may make my case as claudios to cross this in the smallest by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head born to angelo angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour o deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life pardon me good father it is against my oath were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy to him and to his substitutes you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing but what likelihood is in that not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you i know them both the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the dukes death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardines head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you come away it is almost clear dawn

wrongd i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief here is lord angelo shall give you justice reveal yourself to him o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice by course of justice and she will speak most bitterly and strange most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelos forsworn is it not strange that angelos a murderer is t not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virginviolator is it not strange and strange nay it is ten times strange it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to the end of reckoning away with her poor soul she speaks this in the infirmity of sense o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touchd with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike tis not impossible but one the wickedst caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an archvillain believe it royal prince if he be less hes nothing but hes more had i more name for badness by mine honesty if she be madas i believe no other her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as eer i heard in madness o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason what would you say i am the sister of one claudio condemnd upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemnd by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger thats i ant like your grace i came to her from claudio and desired her to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo for her poor brothers pardon thats he indeed you were

thats somewhat madly spoken pardon it the phrase is to the matter mended again the matter proceed in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i prayd and kneeld how he refelld me and how i replied for this was of much lengththe vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brothers head this is most likely o that it were as like as it is true by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speakst or else thou art subornd against his honour in hateful practise first his integrity stands without blemish next it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults proper to himself if he had so offended he would have weighd thy brother by himself and not have cut him off

was the swift celerity of his death which i did think with slower foot came on that braind my purpose but peace be with him that life is better life past fearing death than that which lives to fear make it your comfort so happy is your brother i do my lord reenter angelo mariana friar peter and provost for this newmarried man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wrongd your well defended honour you must pardon for marianas sake but as he adjudged your brother being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promisebreach thereon dependent for your brothers life the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue an angelo for claudio death for death haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure then angelo thy faults thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stoopd to death and with like haste away with him o my most gracious lord i hope you will not mock me with a husband it is your husband mockd you with a husband consenting to the safeguard of your honour i thought your marriage fit else

the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not oertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perishd by the way thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughts merely my lord your suits unprofitable stand up i say i have bethought me of another fault provost how came it claudio was beheaded at an unusual hour it was commanded so had you a special warrant for the deed no my good lord it was by private message for which i do discharge you of your office give up your keys pardon me noble lord i thought it was a fault but knew it not yet did repent me after more

hither let me look upon him exit provost i am sorry one so learned and so wise as you lord angelo have still appeard should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood and lack of temperd judgment

barnardine claudio muffled and juliet which is that barnardine this my lord there was a friar told me of this man sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul that apprehends no further than this world and squarest thy life according thourt condemnd but for those earthly faults i quit them all and pray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to come friar advise him i leave him to your hand what muffled fellows that this is another prisoner that i saved who should have died when claudio lost his head as like almost to claudio as himself unmuffles claudio to isabella  if he be like your brother for his sake is he pardond and for your lovely sake give me your hand and say you will be mine he is my brother too but fitter time for that by this lord angelo perceives hes safe

dear isabel i have a motion much imports your good whereto if youll a willing ear incline whats mine is yours and what is yours is mine so bring us to our palace where well show whats yet behind thats meet you all should know exeunt act i scene i venice a street enter antonio salarino and salanio in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff tis made of whereof it is born i am to learn and such a wantwit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings believe me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great at sea might do i should not see the sandy hourglass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dockd in sand vailing her hightop lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessels side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad why then you are in love fie fie not in love neither then let us say you are sad because you are not merry and twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry because you are not sad now by twoheaded janus nature hath framed strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper and other of such vinegar aspect that theyll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable enter bassanio lorenzo and gratiano here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well we leave you now with better company i would have stayd till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace the occasion to depart good morrow my good lords good signiors both when shall we laugh say when you grow exceeding strange must it be so well make our leisures to attend on yours exeunt salarino and salanio my lord bassanio since you have found antonio we two will leave you but at dinnertime i pray you have in mind where we must meet i will not fail you you look not well signior antonio you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me you are marvellously changed i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish i tell thee what antonio i love thee and it is my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond and do a wilful stillness entertain with purpose to be dressd in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark o my antonio i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing when i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools ill tell thee more of this another time but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon this opinion come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile ill end my exhortation after dinner well we will leave you then till dinnertime i must be one of these same dumb wise men for gratiano never lets me speak well keep me company but two years moe thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue farewell ill grow a talker for this gear thanks i faith for silence is only commendable in a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible exeunt gratiano and lorenzo is that any thing now gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promised to tell me of tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gaged to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlockd to your occasions in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight the selfsame way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalued to catos daughter brutus portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand and many jasons come in quest of her o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rackd even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake exeunt scene ii belmont a room in portias house enter portia and nerissa by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer good sentences and well pronounced they would be better if well followed if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection first there is the neapolitan prince ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith then there is the county palatine he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior every where what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another how like you the young german the duke of saxonys nephew very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should refuse to accept him therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do any thing nerissa ere ill be married to a sponge you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the caskets if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my fathers will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure do you not remember lady in your fathers time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise enter a servingman how now what news the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer another knocks at the door exeunt scene iii venice a public place enter bassanio and shylock three thousand ducats well ay sir for three months for three months well for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound antonio shall become bound well may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i know your answer three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound your answer to that antonio is a good man have you heard any imputation to the contrary oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships are but boards sailors but men there be landrats and waterrats waterthieves and landthieves i mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may take his bond be assured you may i will be assured i may and that i may be assured i will bethink me may i speak with antonio if it please you to dine with us yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but i will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you what news on the rialto who is he comes here enter antonio this is signior antonio aside  how like a fawning publican he looks i hate him for he is a christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice if i can

would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but i am then forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do youll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have oerlookd me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times put bars between

the enjoying of my love there may as well be amity and life tween snow and fire as treason and my love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything promise me life and ill confess the truth well then confess and live confess and love had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance but let me to my fortune and the caskets away then i am lockd in one of them if you do love me you will find me out nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swanlike end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and watery deathbed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a newcrowned monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the seamonster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of the exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray music whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself song tell me where is fancy bred or in the heart or in the head how begot how nourished reply reply it is engenderd in the eyes with gazing fed and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies let us all ring fancys knell ill begin itding dong bell ding dong bell so may the outward shows be least themselves the world is still deceived with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasoned with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward searchd have livers white as milk and these assume but valours excrement to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see tis purchased by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threatenest than dost promise aught thy paleness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence aside  how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair and shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rein thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit what find i here opening the leaden casket fair portias counterfeit what demigod hath come so near creation move these eyes or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion here are severd lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes how could he see to do them having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnishd yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance heres the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune reads you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave i come by note to give and to receive like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether these pearls of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirmd signd ratified by you you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtue beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractised happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen oer myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy expressd and not expressd but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence o then be bold to say bassanios dead my lord and lady it is now our time that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper to cry good joy good joy my lord and lady my lord bassanio and my gentle lady i wish you all the joy that you can wish for i am sure you can wish none from me and

confound a man he plies the duke at morning and at night and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice twenty merchants the duke himself and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture of justice and his bond when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus his countrymen that he would rather have antonios flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him and i know my lord if law authority and power deny not it will go hard with poor antonio is it your dear friend

lover of my lord your husband i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowd in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish misery this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lords return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed

voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honourable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal then ill repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies ill tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practise why shall we turn to men fie what a questions that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come ill tell thee all my

hope that your father got you not that you are not the jews daughter that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother thus when i shun scylla your father i fall into charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a christian truly the more to blame

on the coals for money enter lorenzo ill tell my husband launcelot what you say here he comes i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners nay you need not fear us lorenzo launcelot and i are out he tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because i am a jews daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting jews to christians you raise the price of pork i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negros belly the moor is with child by you launcelot it is much that the moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than i took her for how every fool can play upon the word i think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into

i venice a court of justice enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio gratiano salerio and others what is antonio here ready so please your grace i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer a stony adversary an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity void and empty from any dram of mercy i have heard your grace hath taen great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envys reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am armd to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his go one and call the jew into the court he is ready at the door he comes my lord enter shylock make room and let him stand before our face shylock the world thinks and i think so too that thou but leadst this fashion of thy malice to the last hour of act and then tis thought thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange than is thy strange apparent cruelty and where thou now exactst the penalty which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture but touchd with human gentleness and love forgive a moiety of the principal glancing an eye of pity on his losses that have of late so huddled on his back enow to press a royal merchant down and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint from stubborn turks and tartars never traind to offices of tender courtesy we all expect a gentle answer jew i have possessd your grace of what i purpose and by our holy sabbath have i sworn to have the due and forfeit of my bond if you deny it let the danger light upon your charter and your citys freedom youll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats ill not answer that but say it is my humour is it answerd what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats to have it baned what are you answerd yet some men there are love not a gaping pig some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose cannot contain their urine for affection mistress of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes now for your answer as there is no firm reason to be renderd why he cannot abide a gaping pig why he a harmless necessary cat why he a woollen bagpipe but of force must yield to such inevitable shame as to offend himself being offended so can i give no reason nor i will not more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing i bear antonio that i follow thus a losing suit against him are you answerd this is no answer thou unfeeling man to excuse the current of thy cruelty i am not bound to please thee with my answers do all men kill the things they do not love hates any man the thing he would not kill every offence is not a hate at first what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften thatthan which whats harder his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no more offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will for thy three thousand ducats here is six what judgment shall i dread doing were in six parts and every part a ducat i would not draw them i would have my bond how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong you have among you many a purchased slave which like your asses and your dogs and mules you use in abject and in slavish parts because you bought them shall i say to you let them be free marry them to your heirs why sweat they under burthens let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be seasond with such viands you will answer the slaves are ours so do i answer you the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it if you deny me fie upon your law there is no force in the decrees of venice i stand for judgment answer shall i have it upon my power i may dismiss this court unless bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for to determine this come here today my lord here stays without a messenger with letters from the doctor new come from padua bring us the letter call the messenger good cheer antonio what man courage yet the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you cannot better be employd bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph enter nerissa dressed like a lawyers clerk came you from padua from bellario from both my lord bellario greets your grace presenting a letter why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can no not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee no none that thou hast wit enough to make o be thou damnd inexecrable dog and for thy life let justice be accused thou almost makest me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men thy currish spirit governd a wolf who hangd for human slaughter even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet and whilst thou layst in thy unhallowd dam infused itself in thee for thy desires are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond thou but offendst thy lungs to speak so loud repair thy wit good youth or it will fall to cureless ruin i stand here for law this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court where is he he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether youll admit him with all my heart some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place meantime the court shall hear bellarios letter reads your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we turned oer many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your graces request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation you hear the learnd bellario what he writes and here i take it is the doctor come enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws give me your hand come you from old bellario i did my lord you are welcome take your place are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court i am informed thoroughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew antonio and old shylock both stand forth is your name shylock shylock is my name of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not ay so he says do you confess the bond i do then must the jew be merciful on what compulsion must i tell me that the quality of mercy is not straind it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest gods when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there my deeds upon my head i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond is he not able to discharge the money yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times oer on forfeit of my hands my head my heart if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel o wise young judge how i do honour thee i pray you let me look upon the bond here tis most reverend doctor here it is shylock theres thrice thy money offerd thee an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven shall i lay perjury upon my soul no not for venice why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchants heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond when it is paid according to the tenor it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound i charge you by the law whereof you are a welldeserving pillar proceed to judgment by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me i stay here on my bond most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife o noble judge o excellent young man for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond tis very true o wise and upright judge how much more elder art thou than thy looks therefore lay bare your bosom ay his breast so says the bond doth it not noble judge nearest his heart those are the very words it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh i have them ready have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death is it so nominated in the bond it is not so expressd but what of that twere good you do so much for charity i cannot find it tis not in the bond you merchant have you any thing to say but little i am armd and well prepared give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which lingering penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonios end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough ill pay it presently with all my heart antonio i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself but life itself my wife and all the world are not with me esteemd above thy life i would lose all ay sacrifice them all here to this devil to deliver you your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer i have a wife whom i protest i love i would she were in heaven so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew tis well you offer it behind her back the wish would make else an unquiet house these be the christian husbands i have a daughter would any of the stock of barrabas had been her husband rather than a christian aside we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence a pound of that same merchants flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it most rightful judge and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it most learned judge a sentence come prepare tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond

to portias house enter lorenzo and jessica the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls and sighd his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night in such a night did thisbe fearfully oertrip the dew and saw the lions shadow ere himself and ran dismayd away in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage in such a night medea gatherd the enchanted herbs that did renew old aeson in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont in such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well stealing her soul with many vows of faith and neer a true one in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love and he forgave it her i would outnight you did no body come but hark i hear the

hand and bring your music forth into the air exit stephano how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it enter musicians come ho and wake diana with a hymn with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear and draw her home with music music i am never merry when i hear sweet music the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since nought so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted mark the music enter portia and nerissa that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world when the moon shone we did not see the candle so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king unto the king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark it is your music madam of the house nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day silence bestows that virtue on it madam the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasond are to their right praise and true perfection peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked music ceases that is the voice or i am much deceived of portia he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice dear lady welcome home we have been praying for our husbands healths which speed we hope the better for our words are they returnd madam they are not yet but there is come a messenger before to signify their coming go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence nor you lorenzo jessica nor you a tucket sounds your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet we are

followers we should hold day with the antipodes if you would walk in absence of the sun let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord i thank you madam give welcome to my friend this is the man this is antonio to whom i am so infinitely bound you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you no more than i am well acquitted of sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy to nerissa  by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong in faith i gave it to the judges clerk would he were gelt that had it for my part since you do take it love so much at heart a quarrel ho already whats the matter about a hoop of gold a paltry ring that she did give me whose posy was for all the world like cutlers poetry upon  a knife love me and leave me not what talk you of the posy or the value you swore to me when i did give it you that you would wear it till your hour of death and that it should lie with you in your grave though not for me yet for your vehement oaths you should have been respective and have kept it gave it a judges clerk no gods my judge the clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had it he will an if he live to be a man ay if a woman live to be a man now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself the judges clerk a prating boy that beggd it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wifes first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an twere to me i should be mad at it aside  why i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that beggd it and indeed deserved it too and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he beggd mine and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you received of me if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it it is gone even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will neer come in your bed until i see the ring nor i in yours till i again see mine sweet portia if you did know to whom i gave the ring if you did know for whom i gave the ring and would conceive for what i gave the ring and how unwillingly i left the ring when nought would be accepted but the ring you would abate the strength of your displeasure if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honour to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe ill die fort but some woman had the ring no by my honour madam by my soul no woman had it but a civil doctor which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and beggd the ring the which i did deny him and sufferd him to go displeased away even he that did uphold the very life of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady i was enforced to send it after him i was beset with shame and courtesy my honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it pardon me good lady for by these blessed candles of the night had you been there i think you would have beggd the ring of me to give the worthy doctor let not that doctor eer come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you ill not deny him any thing i have no not my body nor my husbands bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honour which is yet mine own ill have that doctor for my bedfellow and i his clerk therefore be well advised how you do leave me to mine own protection well do you so let not me take him then for if i do ill mar the young clerks pen i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding portia forgive me this enforced wrong and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and theres an oath of credit nay but hear me pardon this fault and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husbands ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me and pardon me my gentle gratiano for that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerk in lieu of this last night did lie with me why this is like the mending of

midnight fie fie hell never come you say he has been thrown in the rivers and has been grievously peaten as an old oman methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come methinks his flesh is punished he shall have no desires so think i too devise but how youll use him when he comes and let us two devise to bring him thither there is an old tale goes that herne the hunter sometime a keeper here in windsor forest doth all the wintertime at still midnight walk round about an oak with great raggd horns and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle and makes milchkine yield blood and shakes a chain in a most hideous and dreadful manner you have heard of such a spirit and well you know the superstitious idleheaded eld received and did deliver to our age this tale of herne the hunter for a truth why yet there want not many that do fear in deep of night to walk by this hernes oak but what of this marry this is our device that falstaff at that oak shall meet with us well let it not be doubted but hell come and in this shape when you have brought him thither what shall be done with him what is your plot that likewise have we thought upon and thus nan page my daughter and my little son and three or four more of their growth well dress like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads and rattles in their hands upon a sudden as falstaff she and i are newly met let them from forth a sawpit rush at once with some diffused song upon their sight we two in great amazedness will fly then let them all encircle him about and fairylike topinch the unclean knight and ask him why that hour of fairy revel in their so sacred paths he dares to tread in shape profane and till he tell the truth let the supposed fairies pinch him sound and burn him with their tapers the truth being known well all present ourselves dishorn the spirit and mock him home to windsor the children must be practised well to this or theyll neer dot i will teach the children their behaviors and i will be like a jackanapes also to burn the knight with my taber that will be excellent ill go and buy them vizards my nan shall be the queen of all the

against my child my daughter hermia stand forth demetrius my noble lord this man hath my consent to marry her stand forth lysander and my gracious duke this man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes and interchanged lovetokens with my child thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love and stolen the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unhardend youth with cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart turnd her obedience which is due to me to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius i beg the ancient privilege of athens as she is mine i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately provided in that case what say you hermia be advised fair maid to you your father should be as a god one that composed your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it demetrius is a worthy gentleman so is lysander in himself he is but in this kind wanting your fathers voice the other must be held the worthier i would my father lookd but with my eyes rather your eyes must with his judgment look i do entreat your grace to pardon me i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your fathers choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mewd to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon thriceblessed they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distilld than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will my virgin patent up unto his lordship whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty take time to pause and by the nest new moon the sealingday betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your fathers will or else to wed demetrius as he would or on dianas altar to protest for aye austerity and single life relent sweet hermia and lysander yield thy crazed title to my certain right you have her fathers love demetrius let me have hermias do you marry him scornful lysander true he hath my love and what is mine my love shall render him and she is mine and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius i am my lord as well derived as he as well possessd my love is more than his my fortunes every way as fairly rankd if not with vantage as demetrius and which is more than all these boasts can be i am beloved of beauteous hermia why should not i then prosecute my right demetrius ill avouch it to his head made love to nedars daughter helena and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry upon this spotted and inconstant man i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof but being overfull of selfaffairs my mind did lose it but demetrius come and come egeus you shall go with me i have some private schooling for you both for you fair hermia look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your fathers will or else the law of athens yields you up which by no means we may extenuate to death or to a vow of single life come my hippolyta what cheer my love demetrius and egeus go along i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves with duty and desire we follow you exeunt all but lysander and hermia how now my love why is your cheek so pale how chance the roses there do fade so fast belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes ay me for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood o cross too high to be enthralld to low or else misgraffed in respect of years o spite too old to be engaged to young or else it stood upon the choice of friends o hell to choose love by anothers eyes or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion if then true lovers have been ever crossd it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancys followers a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee my good lysander i swear to thee by cupids strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burnd the carthage queen when the false troyan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appointed me tomorrow truly will i meet with thee keep promise love look here comes helena enter helena god speed fair helena whither away call you me fair that fair again unsay demetrius loves your fair o happy fair your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherds ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear sickness is catching o were favour so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest id give to be to you translated o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius heart i frown upon him yet he loves me still o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill i give him curses yet he gives me love o that my prayers could such affection move the more i hate the more he follows me the more i love the more he hateth me his folly helena is no fault of mine none but your beauty would that fault were mine take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place before the time i did lysander see seemd athens as a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell helen to you our minds we will unfold tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass a time that lovers flights doth still conceal through athens gates have we devised to steal and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers food till morrow deep midnight i will my hermia exit hermia helena adieu as you on him demetrius dote on you exit how happy some oer other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermias eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile folding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wingd cupid painted blind nor hath loves mind of any judgement taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured every where for ere demetrius lookd on hermias eyne he haild down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermias flight then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again exit scene ii athens quinces house enter quince snug bottom flute snout and starveling is all our company here you were best to call them generally man by man

from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the loved boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorncups and hide them there either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite calld robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern and bootless make the breathless housewife churn and sometime make the drink to bear no barm mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck you do their work and they shall have good luck are not you he thou speakst aright i am that merry wanderer of the night i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and beanfed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossips bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her witherd dewlap pour the ale the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and tailor cries and falls into a cough and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there but room fairy here comes oberon and here my mistress would that he were gone enter from one side oberon with his train from the other titania with hers ill met by moonlight proud titania what jealous oberon fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida why art thou here come from the farthest steppe of india but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskind mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia whom he ravished and make him with fair aegle break his faith with ariadne and antiopa these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summers spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by paved fountain or by rushy brook or in the beached margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have suckd up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents the ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard the fold stands empty in the drowned field and crows are fatted with the murrion flock the nine mens morris is filld up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here no night is now with hymn or carol blest therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazed world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman set your heart at rest the fairy land buys not the child of me his mother was a votaress of my order and in the spiced indian air by night full often hath she gossipd by my side and sat with me on neptunes yellow sands marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laughd to see the sails conceive and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait followingher womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake do i rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him how long within this wood intend you stay perchance till after theseus weddingday if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts give me that boy and i will go with thee not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away we shall chide downright if i longer stay exit titania with her train well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury my gentle puck come hither thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphins back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the seamaids music i remember that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all armd a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west and loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupids fiery shaft quenchd in the chaste beams of the watery moon and the imperial votaress passed on in maiden meditation fancyfree yet markd i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milkwhite now purple with loves wound and maidens call it loveinidleness fetch me that flower the herb i shewd thee once the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make

mad spirit what nightrule now about this haunted grove my mistress with a monster is in love near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus nuptialday the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and enterd in a brake when i did him at this advantage take an asss nole i fixed on his head anon his thisbe must be answered and forth my mimic comes when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russetpated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the guns report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here oer and oer one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment so it came to pass titania waked and straightway loved an ass this falls out better than i could devise but hast thou yet latchd the athenians eyes with the lovejuice as i did bid thee do i took him sleepingthat is finishd too and the athenian woman by his side that when he waked of force she must be eyed enter hermia and demetrius stand close this is the same athenian this is the woman but not this the man o

would not do me thus much injury can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up

the night than all you fiery oes and eyes of light why seekst thou me could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so you speak not as you think it cannot be lo she is one of this confederacy now i perceive they have conjoind all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me injurious hermia most ungrateful maid have you conspired have you with these contrived to bait me with this foul derision is all the counsel that we two have shared the sisters vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hastyfooted time for parting uso is it all forgot all schooldays friendship childhood innocence we hermia like two artificial gods have with our needles created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands our sides voices and minds had been incorporate so we grow together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition two lovely berries moulded on one stem so with two seeming bodies but one heart two of the first like coats in heraldry due but to one and crowned with one crest and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend it is not friendly tis not maidenly our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury i am amazed at your passionate words i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial wherefore speaks he this to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent what thought i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unloved this you should pity rather than despise i understand not what you mean by this ay do persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up this sport well carried shall be chronicled if you have any pity grace or manners you would not make me such an argument but fare ye well tis partly my own fault which death or absence soon shall remedy stay gentle helena hear my excuse my love my life my soul fair helena o excellent sweet do not scorn her so if she cannot entreat i can compel thou canst compel no more than she entreat thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers helen i love thee by my life i

tends all this away you ethiope no no hell          seem to break loose take on as you would follow but yet come not you are a tame man go hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent why are you grown so rude what change is this sweet love thy love out tawny tartar out out loathed medicine hated potion hence do you not jest yes sooth and so do you demetrius i will keep my word with thee i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you ill not trust your word what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead although i hate her ill not

this sweet sight her dotage now i do begin to pity for meeting her of late behind the wood seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool i did upbraid her and fall out with her for she his hairy temples then had rounded with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms beggd my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land and now i have the boy i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes and gentle puck take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this nights accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream but first i will release the fairy

uncouple in the western valley let them go dispatch i say and find the forester exit an attendant we will fair queen up to the mountains top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bayd the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seemd all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flewd so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crookkneed and dewlappd like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matchd in mouth like bells each under each a cry more tuneable was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedars helena i wonder of their being here together no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace our solemnity but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice it is my lord go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns horns and shout within lysander demetrius helena and hermia wake and start up good morrow friends saint valentine is past begin these woodbirds but to couple now pardon my lord i pray you all stand up i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity my lord i shall reply amazedly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here but as i thinkfor truly would i speak and now do i bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law enough enough my lord you have enough i beg the law the law upon his head they would have stolen away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wife my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither followd them fair helena in fancy following me but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it ismy love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena to her my lord was i betrothd ere i saw hermia but like in sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will for evermore be true to it fair lovers you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit and for the morning now is something worn our purposed hunting shall be set aside away with us to athens three and three well hold a feast in great solemnity come hippolyta exeunt theseus hippolyta egeus and train these things seem small and undistinguishable methinks i see these things with parted eye when every thing seems double so methinks and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own are you sure that we are awake it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him yea and my father and hippolyta and he did bid us follow to the temple why then we are awake lets follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams exeunt awaking  when my cue comes call me and i will answer my next is most fair pyramus heighho peter quince flute the bellowsmender snout the tinker starveling gods my life stolen hence and left me asleep i have had a most rare vision i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream methought i wasthere is no man can tell what methought i wasand methought i hadbut man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen mans hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called bottoms dream because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at her death exit scene ii athens quinces house enter quince flute snout and starveling have you sent to bottoms house  is he come home yet he cannot be heard of out of doubt he is transported if he come not then the play is marred it goes not forward doth it it is not possible you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice you must say paragon a paramour is god bless us a thing of naught enter snug masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone forward we had all been made men o sweet bully bottom thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus ill be hanged he would have deserved it sixpence a day in pyramus or nothing enter bottom where are these lads where are these hearts bottom o most courageous day o most happy hour masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if i tell you i am no true athenian i will tell you every thing right as it fell out let us hear sweet bottom not a word of me all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look oer his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred in any case let thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails for they shall hang out for the lions claws and most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy no more words away go away exeunt act v scene i athens the palace of theseus enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and attendants tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt the poets eye in fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poets pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together more witnesseth than fancys images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable here come the lovers full of joy and mirth enter lysander demetrius hermia and helena joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our aftersupper and bedtime where is our usual manager of mirth what revels are in hand is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour call philostrate here mighty theseus say what abridgement have you for this evening what masque what music how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight there is a brief how many sports are ripe make choice of which your highness will see first giving a paper reads  the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp well none of that that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules reads the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage that is an old device and it was playd when i from thebes came last a conqueror reads the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceased in beggary that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony reads a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth merry and tragical tedious and brief that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord a play there is my lord some ten words long which is as brief as i have known a play but by ten words my lord it is too long which makes it tedious for in all the play there is not one word apt one player fitted and tragical my noble lord it is for pyramus therein doth kill himself which when i saw rehearsed i must confess made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed what are they that do play it hardhanded men that work in athens here which never labourd in their minds till now and now have toild their unbreathed memories with this same play against your nuptial and we will hear it no my noble lord it is not for you i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretchd and connd with cruel pain to do you service i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it go bring them in and take your places ladies exit philostrate i love not to see wretchedness oer charged and duty in his service perishing why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing he says they can do nothing in this kind the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practised accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pickd a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tonguetied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity reenter philostrate so please your grace the prologue is addressd let him approach flourish of trumpets enter quince for the prologue if we offend it is with our good will that you should think we come not to offend but with good will to show our simple skill that is the true beginning of our end consider then we come but in despite we do not come as minding to contest you our true intent is all for your delight we are not here that you should here repent you the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know this fellow doth not stand upon points he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next enter pyramus and thisbe wall moonshine and lion gentles perchance you wonder at this show but wonder on till truth make all things plain this man is pyramus if you would know this beauteous lady thisby is certain this man with lime and roughcast doth present wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through walls chink poor souls they are content to whisper at the which let no man wonder this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn presenteth moonshine for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo this grisly beast which lion hight by name the trusty thisby coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fled her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisbys mantle slain whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broachd is boiling bloody breast and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain exeunt prologue thisbe lion and moonshine i wonder if the lion be to speak no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisby did whisper often very secretly this loam this roughcast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper would you desire lime and hair to speak better it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord enter pyramus pyramus draws near the wall silence o grimlookd night o night with hue so black o night which ever art when day is not o night o night alack alack alack i fear my thisbys promise is forgot and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall that standst between her fathers ground and mine thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne wall holds up his fingers thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this but what see i no thisby do i see o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me the wall methinks being sensible should curse again no in truth sir he should not deceiving me is thisbys cue she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes enter thisbe o wall full often hast thou heard my moans for parting my fair pyramus and me my cherry lips have often kissd thy stones thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee i see a voice now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisbys face thisby my love thou art my love i think think what thou wilt i am thy lovers grace and like limander am i trusty still and i like helen till the fates me kill not shafalus to procrus was so true as shafalus to procrus i to you o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall i kiss the walls hole not your lips at all wilt thou at ninnys tomb meet me straightway tide life tide death i come without delay exeunt pyramus and thisbe thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away doth go exit now is the mural down between the two neighbours no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them it must be your imagination then and not theirs if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion enter lion and moonshine you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar then know that i one snug the joiner am a lionfell nor else no lions dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place twere pity on my life a very gentle beast of a good conscience the very best at a beast my lord that eer i saw this lion is a very fox for his valour true and a goose for his discretion not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon this lanthorn doth the horned moon present he should have worn the horns on his head he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference this lanthorn doth the horned moon present myself the man i the moon do seem to be this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the man i the moon he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff i am aweary of this moon would he would change it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time proceed moon all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon i the man in the moon this thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe enter thisbe this is old ninnys tomb where is my love roaring  oh thisbe runs off well roared lion well run thisbe well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace the lion shakes thisbes mantle and exit well moused lion and so the lion vanished and then came pyramus enter pyramus sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams i thank thee moon for shining now so bright for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams i trust to take of truest thisby sight but stay o spite but mark poor knight what dreadful dole is here eyes do you see how can it be o dainty duck o dear thy mantle good what staind with blood approach ye furies fell o fates come come cut thread and thrum quail crush conclude and quell this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad beshrew my heart but i pity the man o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame since lion vile hath here deflowerd my dear which isno nowhich was the fairest dame that lived that loved that liked that lookd with cheer come tears confound out sword and wound the pap of pyramus ay that left pap where heart doth hop stabs himself thus die i thus thus thus now am i dead now am i fled my soul is in the sky tongue lose thy light moon take thy flight exit moonshine now die die die die die dies no die but an ace for him for he is but one less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover she will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the play reenter thisbe methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be brief a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes and thus she means videlicet asleep my love what dead my dove o pyramus arise speak speak quite dumb dead dead a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes these my lips this cherry nose these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone are gone lovers make moan his eyes were green as leeks o sisters three come come to me with hands as pale as milk lay them in gore since you have shore with shears his thread of silk tongue not a word come trusty sword come blade my breast imbrue stabs herself and farewell friends thus thisby ends adieu adieu adieu dies moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead ay and wall too starting up  no assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there needs none to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbes garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone a dance the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed tis almost fairy time i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatchd this palpablegross play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollity exeunt enter puck now the hungry lion roars and the wolf behowls the moon whilst the heavy ploughman snores all with weary task fordone now the wasted brands do glow whilst the screechowl screeching loud puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide every one lets forth his sprite in the churchway paths to glide and we fairies that do run by the triple hecates team from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream now are frolic not a mouse shall disturb this hallowd house i am sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door enter oberon and titania with their train through the house give gathering light by the dead and drowsy fire every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier and this ditty after me sing and dance it trippingly first rehearse your song by rote to each word a warbling note hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place song and dance now until the break of day through this house each fairy stray to the best bridebed will we which by us shall blessed be and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be and the blots of natures hand shall not in their issue stand never mole hare lip nor scar nor mark prodigious such as are despised in nativity shall upon their children be with this fielddew consecrate every fairy take his gait and each several chamber bless through this palace with sweet peace and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest trip away make no stay meet me all by break of day exeunt oberon titania and train if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumberd here while these visions did appear and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend if you pardon we will mend and as i am an honest puck if we have unearned luck now to scape the serpents tongue we will make amends ere long else the puck a liar call so good night unto you all give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore amends act i scene i before leonatos house enter leonato hero and beatrice with a messenger i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon comes this night to messina he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him how many gentlemen have you lost in this action but few of any sort and none of name a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don peter hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness did he break out into tears in great measure a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no i know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort what is he that you ask for niece my cousin means signior benedick of padua o hes returned and as pleasant as ever he was he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncles fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the birdbolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but hell be meet with you i doubt it not he hath done good service lady in these wars you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach and a good soldier too lady and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but theres a skirmish of wit between them alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother ist possible very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block i see lady the gentleman is not in your books no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil he is most in the company of the right noble claudio o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured i

benedick nobody marks you what my dear lady disdain are you yet living is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence then is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain i am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as

honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex no i pray thee speak in sober judgment why i faith methinks shes too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her would you buy her that you inquire after her can the world buy such a jewel yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good harefinder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter theres her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december but i hope you have no intent to turn husband have you i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the contrary if hero would be my wife ist come to this in faith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion shall i never see a bachelor of threescore again go to i faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you reenter don pedro what secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonatos i would your grace would constrain me to tell i charge thee on thy allegiance you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love with who now that is your graces part mark how short his answer iswith hero leonatos short daughter if this were so so were it uttered like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be otherwise amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy you speak this to fetch me in my lord by my troth i speak my thought and in faith my lord i spoke mine and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine that i love her i feel that she is worthy i know that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will live a bachelor i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a balladmakers pen and hang me up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of blind cupid well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam well as time shall try in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear it pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign here you may see benedick the married man if this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in venice thou wilt quake for this shortly i look for an earthquake too then well you temporize with the hours in the meantime good signior benedick repair to leonatos commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so i commit you to the tuition of god from my house if i had it the sixth of july your loving friend benedick nay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so i leave you exit my liege your highness now may do me good my love is thine to teach teach it but how and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good hath leonato any son my lord no child but hero shes his only heir dost thou affect her claudio o my lord when you went onward on this ended action i lookd upon her with a soldiers eye that liked but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am returnd and that warthoughts have left their places vacant in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires all prompting me how fair young hero is saying i liked her ere i went to wars thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words if thou dost love fair hero cherish it and i will break with her and with her father and thou shalt have her wast not to this end that thou beganst to twist so fine a story how sweetly you do minister to love that know loves grief by his complexion but lest my liking might too sudden seem i would have salved it with a longer treatise what need the bridge much broader than the flood the fairest grant is the necessity look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest and i will fit thee with the remedy i know we shall have revelling tonight i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio and in her bosom ill unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale then after to her father will i break and the conclusion is she shall be thine in practise let us put it presently exeunt scene ii a room in leonatos house enter leonato and antonio meeting how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music he is very busy about it but brother i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of are they good as the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward the prince and count claudio walking in a thickpleached alley in mine orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it hath the fellow any wit that told you this a good sharp fellow i will send for him and question him yourself no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of it enter attendants cousins you know what you have to do o i cry you mercy friend go you with me and i will use your skill good cousin have a care this busy time exeunt scene iii the same enter don john and conrade what the goodyear my lord why are you thus out of measure sad there is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit you should hear reason and when i have heard it what blessing brings it if not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance i wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art born under saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief i cannot hide what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile at no mans jests eat when i have stomach and wait for no mans leisure sleep when i am drowsy and tend on no mans business laugh when i am merry and claw no man in his humour yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment you have of late stood out against your brother and he hath taen you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plaindealing villain i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me can you make no use of your discontent i make all use of it for i use it only who comes here enter borachio what news borachio i came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage will it serve

come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure that young startup hath all the glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me to the death my lord let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that i am subdued would the cook were of my mind shall we go prove whats to be done well wait upon your lordship exeunt act ii scene i a hall in leonatos house enter leonato antonio hero beatrice and others was not count john here at supper i saw him not how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after he is of a very melancholy disposition he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling then half signior benedicks tongue in count johns mouth and half count johns melancholy in signior benedicks face with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her goodwill by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue in faith shes too curst too curst is more than curst i shall lessen gods sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none so by being too curst god will send you no horns just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen you may light on a husband that hath no beard what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waitinggentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his apes into hell well then go you into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven heres no place for you maids so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long to hero

another curtsy and say father as it please me well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle ill none adams sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerlymodest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque pace faster and faster till

he why he is the princes jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me when i know the gentleman ill tell him what you say do do hell but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then theres a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night music we must follow the leaders in every good thing nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning dance then exeunt all except don john borachio and claudio sure my brother is amorous on hero

these ill news with the ears of claudio tis certain so the prince wooes for himself friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero reenter benedick count claudio yea the same come will you go with me whither even to the next willow about your own business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurers chain or under your arm like a lieutenants scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero i wish him joy of her why thats spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus i pray you leave me ho now you strike like the blind man twas the boy that stole your meat and youll beat the post if it will not be ill leave you exit alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the princes fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well ill be revenged as i may reenter don pedro now signior wheres the count did you see him troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willowtree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped to be whipped whats his fault the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals it wilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is in the stealer yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his birds nest i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the princes jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam bad left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her look here she comes enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato will your grace command me any service to the worlds end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester johns foot fetch you a hair off the great chams beard do you any embassage to the pigmies rather than hold three words conference with this harpy you have no employment for me none but to desire your good company o god sir heres a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue exit come lady come you have lost the heart of signior benedick indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it you have put him down lady you have put him down so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek why how now count wherefore are you sad not sad my lord how then sick neither my lord the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion i faith lady i think your blazon to be true though ill be sworn if he be so his conceit is false here claudio i have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and god give thee joy count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and an grace say amen to it speak

cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither in faith lady you have a merry heart yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart and so she doth cousin good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry heighho for a husband lady beatrice i will get you one i would rather have one of your fathers getting hath your grace neer a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them will you have me lady no my lord unless i might have another for workingdays your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born cousins god give you joy niece will you look to those things i told you of i cry you mercy uncle by your graces pardon exit by my troth a pleasantspirited lady theres little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit she were an excellent wife for benedict o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad county claudio when mean you to go to church tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites not till monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of hercules labours which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings and i my lord and you too gentle hero i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty i will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i with your two helps will so practise on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer hi s glory shall be ours for we are the only lovegods go in with me and i will tell you my drift exeunt scene ii the same enter don john and borachio it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato yea my lord but i can cross it any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me show me briefly how i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero i remember i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber window what life is in that to be the death of this marriage the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold upto a contaminated stale such a one as hero what proof shall i make of that proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue only to despite them i will endeavour any thing go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio asin love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maidthat you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamberwindow hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended weddingfor in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absentand there shall appear such seeming truth of heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in practise be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me i will presently go learn their day of marriage exeunt scene iii leonatos orchard enter benedick boy enter boy signior in my chamberwindow lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard i am here already sir i know that but i would have thee hence and here again exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be thats certain wise or ill none virtuous or ill never cheapen her fair or ill   never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour withdraws enter don pedro claudio and leonato come shall we hear this music yea my good lord how still the evening is as hushd on purpose to grace harmony see you where benedick hath hid himself o very well my lord the music ended well fit the kidfox with a pennyworth enter balthasar with music come balthasar well hear that song again o good my lord tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection i pray thee sing and let me woo no more because you talk of wooing i will sing since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes yet will he swear he loves now pray thee come or if thou wilt hold longer argument do it in notes note this before my notes theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting why these are very crotchets that he speaks note notes forsooth and nothing air now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies well a horn for my money when alls done the song sigh no more ladies sigh no more men were deceivers ever one foot in sea and one on shore to one thing constant never then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny sing no more ditties sing no moe of dumps so dull and heavy the fraud of men was ever so since summer first was leafy then sigh not so  and c by my troth a good song and an ill singer my lord ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the nightraven come what plague could have come after it yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady heros chamberwindow the best i can my lord do so farewell exit balthasar come hither leonato what was it you told me of today that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did never think that lady would have loved any man no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor ist possible sits the wind in that corner by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought may be she doth but counterfeit faith like enough o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it why what effects of passion shows she bait the hook well this fish will bite what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how she did indeed how how pray you you amaze me i would have i thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick i should think this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such reverence he hath taen the infection hold it up hath she made her affection known to benedick no and swears she never will thats her torment tis true indeed so your daughter says shall i says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that i love him this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for shell be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet that o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o sweet benedick god give me patience she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse an he should it were an alms to hang him shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous and she is exceeding wise in every thing but in loving benedick o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what a will say were it good think you hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit he is a very proper man he hath indeed a good outward happiness before god and in my mind very wise he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit and i take him to be valiant as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady my lord will you walk dinner is ready if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumbshow let us send her to call him in to dinner exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato coming forward  this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here comes beatrice by this day shes a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her enter beatrice against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner fair beatrice i thank you for your pains i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come you take pleasure then in the message yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well exit ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture exit act iii scene i leonatos garden enter hero margaret and ursula good margaret run thee to the parlor there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripend by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose  this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone ill make her come i warrant you presently exit now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice behind now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference the pleasantst angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it approaching the bower no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggerds of the rock but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely so says the prince and my newtrothed lord and did they bid you tell her of it madam they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they loved benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a womans heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so selfendeared sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest she make sport at it why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward if fairfaced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antique made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth sure sure such carping is not commendable no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like coverd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling yet tell her of it hear what she will say no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly ill devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking o do not do your cousin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to haveas to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy indeed he hath an excellent good name his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam why every day tomorrow come go in ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow shes limed i warrant you we have caught her madam if it proves so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula coming forward what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemnd for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly exit scene ii a room in leonatos house enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks gallants i am not as i have been so say imethinks you are sadder i hope he be in love hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants money i have the toothache draw it hang it you must hang it first and draw it afterwards what sigh for the toothache where is but a humour or a worm well every one can master a grief but he that has it yet say i he is in love there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat o mornings what should that bode hath any man seen him at the barbers no but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennisballs indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love the greatest note of it is his melancholy and when was he wont to wash his face yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say of him nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now governed by stops indeed that tells a heavy tale for him conclude conclude he is in love nay but i know who loves him that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him she shall be buried with her face upwards yet is this no charm for the toothache old signior walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobbyhorses must not hear exeunt benedick and leonato for my life to break with him about beatrice tis even so hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet enter don john my lord and brother god save you good den brother if your leisure served i would speak with you in private if it please you yet count claudio may hear for what i would speak of concerns him whats the matter to claudio  means your lordship to be married tomorrow you know he does i know not that when he knows what i know if there be any impediment i pray you discover it you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will manifest for my brother i think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed why whats the matter i came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened for she has been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal who hero even she leonatos hero your hero every mans hero disloyal the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i could say she were worse think you of a worse title and i will fit her to it wonder not till further warrant go but with me tonight you shall see her chamberwindow entered even the night before her weddingday if you love her then tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind may this be so i will not think it if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly if i see any thing tonight why i should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i shame her and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with thee to disgrace her i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself o day untowardly turned o mischief strangely thwarting o plague right well prevented so will you say when you have seen the sequel exeunt scene iii a street enter dogberry and verges with the watch are you good men and true yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the princes watch well give them their charge neighbour dogberry first who think you the most desertless man to be constable hugh otecake sir or george seacole for they can write and read come hither neighbour seacole god hath blessed you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature both which master constable you have i knew it would be your answer well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the princes name how if a will not stand why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the princes subjects true and they are to meddle with none but the princes subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed how if they will not why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for well sir if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company you have been always called a merciful man partner truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats tis very true this is the end of the chargeyou constable are to present the princes own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him nay byr our lady that i think a cannot five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will byr lady i think it be so ha ha ha well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows counsels and your own and good night come neighbour well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the churchbench till two and then all to bed one word more honest neighbours i pray you watch about signior leonatos door for the wedding being there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight adieu be

some treason masters yet stand close therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats is it possible that any villany should be so dear thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will i wonder at it that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man yes it is apparel i mean the fashion yes the fashion is the fashion tush i may as well say the fools the fool but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is aside  i know that deformed a has been a vile thief this seven year a goes up and down like a gentleman i remember his name didst thou not hear somebody no twas the vane on the house seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty sometimes fashioning them like pharaohs soldiers in the reeky painting sometime like god bels priests in the old churchwindow sometime like the shaven hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club all this i see and i see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion not so neither but know that i have tonight wooed margaret the lady heros gentlewoman by the name of hero she leans me out at her mistress chamberwindow bids me a thousand times good nighti tell this tale vilelyi should first tell thee how the prince claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter and thought they margaret was hero two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander that don john had made away went claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw oer night and send her home again without a husband we charge you in the princes name stand call up the right master constable we have here recovered the most dangerous

back again give not this rotten orange to your friend shes but the sign and semblance of her honour behold how like a maid she blushes here o what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue would you not swear all you that see her that she were a maid by these exterior shows but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed her blush is guiltiness not modesty what do you mean my lord not to be married not to knit my soul to an approved wanton dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquishd the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity i know what you would say if i have known her you will say she did embrace me as a husband and so extenuate the forehand sin no leonato i never tempted her with word too large but as a brother to his sister showd bashful sincerity and comely love and seemd i ever otherwise to you out on thee seeming i will write against it you seem to me as dian in her orb as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus or those pamperd animals that rage in savage sensuality is my lord well that he doth speak so wide sweet prince why speak not you what should i speak i stand dishonourd that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale are these things spoken or do i but dream sir they are

what of this my lord let me but move one question to your daughter and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her bid her answer truly i charge thee do so as thou art my child o god defend me how am i beset what kind of catechising call you this to make you answer truly to your name is it not hero who can blot that name with any just reproach marry that can hero hero itself can blot out heros virtue what man was he talkd with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one now if you are a maid answer to this i talkd with no man at that hour my lord why then are you no maiden leonato i am sorry you must hear upon mine honour myself my brother and this grieved count did see her hear her at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamberwindow who hath indeed most like a liberal villain confessd the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret fie fie they are not to be named my lord not to be spoke of there is not chastity enough in language without offence to utter them thus pretty lady i am sorry for thy much misgovernment o hero what a hero hadst thou been if half thy outward graces had been placed about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell thou pure impiety and impious purity for thee ill lock up all the gates of love and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm and never shall it more be gracious hath no mans dagger here a point for me hero swoons why how now cousin wherefore sink you down come let us go these things come thus to light smother her spirits up exeunt don pedro don john and claudio how doth the lady dead i think help uncle hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wishd for how now cousin hero have comfort lady dost thou look up yea wherefore should she not wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal natures frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggars issue at my gates who smirchd thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of herwhy she o she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foultainted flesh sir sir be patient for my part i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say o on my soul my cousin is belied lady were you her bedfellow last night no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made which was before barrd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness washd it with tears hence from her let her die hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune  by noting of the lady i have markd a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes and in her eye there hath appeard a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observations which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seekst thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness lady what man is he you are accused of they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintaind the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death there is some strange misprision in the princes two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practise of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villanies i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your familys old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial what shall become of this what will this do marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must so be maintaind upon the instant that she was accused shall be lamented pitied and excused of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparelld in more precious habit more movingdelicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levelld false the supposition of the ladys death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body being that i flow

about him bring him away o that i had been writ down an ass exeunt act v scene i before leonatos house enter leonato and antonio if you go on thus you will kill yourself and tis not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candlewasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial medicine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no tis all mens office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no mans virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement therein do men from children nothing differ i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance yet bend not all the harm upon yourself make those that do offend you suffer too

at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty in so high a style margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it to have no man come over me why shall i always keep below stairs thy wit is as quick as the greyhounds mouth it catches and yours as blunt as the fencers foils which hit but hurt not a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give thee the bucklers give us the swords we have bucklers of our own if you use them margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legs and therefore will come exit margaret sings the god of love that sits above and knows me and knows me how pitiful i deserve i mean in singing but in loving leander the good swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmangers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love marry i cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet nor i cannot woo in festival terms enter beatrice sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee yea signior and depart when you bid me o stay but till then then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love indeed for i love thee against my will in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably it appears not in this confession theres not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself an old an old instance beatrice that lived in the lime of good neighbours if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps and how long is that think you question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise if don worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as i am to myself so much for praising myself who i myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin very ill and how do you very ill too serve god love me and mend there will i leave you too for here comes one in haste enter ursula madam you must come to your uncle yonders old coil at home it is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused the prince and claudio mightily abused and don john is the author of all who is fed and gone will you

solemn hymn song pardon goddess of the night those that slew thy virgin knight for the which with songs of woe round about her tomb they go midnight assist our moan help us to sigh and groan heavily

margaret was in some fault for this although against her will as it appears in the true course of all the question well i am glad that all things sort so well and so am i being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it well daughter and you gentlewomen all withdraw into a chamber by yourselves and when i send for you come hither maskd exeunt ladies the prince and claudio

frost of storm and cloudiness i think he thinks upon the savage bull tush fear not man well tip thy horns with gold and all europa shall rejoice at thee as once europa did at lusty jove when he would play the noble beast in love bull jove sir had an amiable low and some such strange bull leapd your fathers cow and got a calf in that same noble feat much like to you for you have just his bleat for

other wife unmasking and when you loved you were my other husband another hero nothing certainer one hero died defiled but i do live and surely as i live i am a maid the former hero hero that is dead she died my lord but whiles her slander lived all this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended ill tell you largely of fair heros death meantime let wonder seem familiar and to the chapel let us presently soft and fair friar which is beatrice unmasking  i answer to that name what is your will do not you love me why no no more than reason why then your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived they swore you did do not you love me troth no no more than reason why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did they swore that you were almost sick for me they swore that you were wellnigh dead for me tis no such matter then you do not love me no truly but in friendly recompense come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman and ill be sworn upont that he loves her for heres a paper written in his hand a halting sonnet of his own pure brain fashiond to beatrice and heres another writ in my cousins hand stolen from her pocket containing her affection unto benedick a miracle heres our own hands against our hearts come i will have thee but by this light i take thee for pity i would not deny you but by this good day i yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for i was told you were in a consumption peace i will stop your mouth kissing her how dost thou benedick the married man ill tell thee what prince a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour dost thou think i  care for a satire or an epigram no if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear nothing handsome about him in brief since i do purpose to marry i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what i have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life to make thee a doubledealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee come come we are friends lets have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives heels well have dancing afterward first of my word therefore play music prince thou art sad get thee a

who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this sblood but you will not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate despise me if i do not three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant offcappd to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffd with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practise is all his soldiership but he sir had the election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christian and heathen must be beleed and calmd by debitor and creditor this countercaster he in good time must his lieutenant be and igod bless the markhis moorships ancient by heaven i rather would have been his hangman why theres no remedy tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to the first now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor i would not follow him then o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly followd you shall mark many a duteous and kneecrooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his masters ass for nought but provender and when hes old cashierd whip me such honest knaves others there are who trimmd in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am what a full fortune

where hast thou stowd my daughter damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her for ill refer me to all things of sense if she in chains of magic were not bound whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curled darlings of our nation would ever have to incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight judge me the world if tis not gross in sense that thou hast practised on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion ill havet disputed on tis probable and palpable to thinking i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril hold your hands both you of my inclining and the rest were it my cue to fight i should have known it without a prompter where will you that i go to answer this your charge to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer what if i do obey how may the duke be therewith satisfied whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him tis true most worthy signior the dukes in council and your noble self i am sure is sent for how the duke in council in this time of the night bring him away mines not an idle cause the duke himself or any of my brothers of the state cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own for if such actions may have passage free bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be exeunt scene iii a councilchamber the duke and senators sitting at a table officers attending there is no composition in these news that gives them credit indeed they are disproportiond my letters say a hundred and seven galleys and mine a hundred and forty and mine two hundred but though they jump not on a just account as in these cases where the aim reports tis oft with differenceyet do they all confirm a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus nay it is possible enough to judgment i do not so secure me in the error but the main article i do approve in fearful sense within  what ho what ho what ho a messenger from the galleys enter a sailor now whats the business the turkish preparation makes for rhodes so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo how say you by this change this cannot be by no assay of reason tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dressd in if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless nay in all confidence hes not for rhodes here is more news enter a messenger the ottomites reverend and gracious steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes have there injointed them with an after fleet ay so i thought how many as you guess of thirty sail and now they do restem their backward course bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus signior montano your trusty and most valiant servitor with his free duty recommends you thus and prays you to believe him tis certain then for cyprus marcus luccicos is not he in town hes now in florence write from us to him postposthaste dispatch here comes brabantio and the valiant moor enter brabantio othello iago roderigo and officers valiant othello we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman to brabantio i did not see you welcome gentle signior we lackd your counsel and your help tonight so did i yours good your grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so floodgate and oerbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself why whats the matter my daughter o my daughter dead ay to me she is abused stoln from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so preposterously to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense yea though our proper son stood in your action humbly i thank your grace here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the stateaffairs hath hither brought we are very sorry fort to othello  what in your own part can you say to this nothing but this is so most potent grave and reverend signiors my very noble and approved good masters that i have taen away this old mans daughter it is most true true i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech and little blessd with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years pith till now some nine moons wasted they have used their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnishd tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushd at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit every thing to fall in love with what she feard to look on it is a judgment maimd and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practises of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful oer the blood or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him but othello speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maids affections or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and let her speak of me before her father if you do find me foul in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not only take away but let your sentence even fall upon my life fetch desdemona hither ancient conduct them you best know the place exeunt iago and attendants and till she come as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears ill present how i did thrive in this fair ladys love and she in mine say it othello her father loved me oft invited me still questiond me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have passed i ran it through even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hairbreadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my travels history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speaksuch was the process and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the houseaffairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch sheld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth sufferd my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful she wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd that heaven had made her such a man she thankd me and bade me if i had a friend that loved her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had passd and i loved her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have used here comes the lady let her witness it enter desdemona iago and attendants i think this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but heres my husband and so much duty as my mother showd to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord god be wi you i have done please it your grace on to the stateaffairs i had rather to adopt a child than get it come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes the robbd that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thricedriven bed of down i do agnise a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit disposition for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding if you please bet at her fathers ill not have it so nor i nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice to assist my simpleness what would you desdemona that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my hearts subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othellos visage in his mind and to his honour and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him let her have your voices vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heatthe young affects in me defunctand proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no when lightwingd toys of featherd cupid seal with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going the affair cries haste and speed must answer it you must away tonight with all my heart at nine i the morning here well meet again othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honest and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me let it be so good night to every one to brabantio and noble signior if virtue no delighted beauty lack your soninlaw is far more fair than black adieu brave moor use desdemona well look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may thee exeunt duke of venice senators officers  and c my life upon her

direction to spend with thee we must obey the time exeunt othello and desdemona iago what sayst thou noble heart what will i do thinkest thou why go to bed and sleep i will incontinently drown myself if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guineahen i would change my humanity with a baboon what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it cannot be it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy pursenor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with moneythe food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue thou art sure of mego make moneyi have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu where shall we meet i the morning at my lodging ill be with thee betimes go to farewell do you hear roderigo what say you no more of drowning do you hear i am changed ill go sell all my land exit thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gaind knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets he has done my office i know not ift be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind

praise me i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliverd if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the ones for use the other useth it well praised how if she be black and witty if she be black and thereto have a wit shell find a white that shall her blackness fit worse and worse how if fair and foolish she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helpd her to an heir these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her thats foul and foolish theres none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lackd gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angerd her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cods head for the salmons tail she that could think and neer disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were to do what

ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clysterpipes for your sake trumpet within the moor i know his trumpet tis truly so lets meet him and receive him lo where he comes enter othello and attendants o my fair warrior my dear othello it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me o my souls joy if after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have wakend death and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympushigh and duck again as low as hells from heaven if it were now to die twere now to be most happy for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow amen to that sweet powers i cannot speak enough of this content it stops me here it is too much of joy and this and this the greatest discords be kissing her that eer our hearts shall make aside  o you are well tuned now but ill set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am come let us to the castle news friends our wars are done the turks are drownd how does my old acquaintance of this isle honey you shall be well desired in cyprus i have found great love amongst them o my sweet i prattle

respect come desdemona once more well met at cyprus exeunt othello desdemona and attendants do thou meet me presently at the harbour come hither if thou best valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guardfirst i must tell thee thisdesdemona is directly in love with him with him why tis not possible lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this grantedas it is a most pregnant and unforced positionwho stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already i cannot believe that in her shes full of most blessed condition blessed figsend the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that yes that i did but that was but courtesy lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villanous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command ill layt upon you cassio knows you not ill not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister well sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell adieu exit that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think hell prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leapd into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evend with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand

to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as the other tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island but is he often thus tis evermore the prologue to his sleep hell watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle it were well the general were put in mind of it perhaps he sees it not or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils is not this true enter roderigo aside to him  how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go exit roderigo and tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evilbut hark what noise cry within help help reenter cassio driving in roderigo you rogue you rascal whats the matter lieutenant a knave teach me my duty ill beat the knave

to the death faints hold for your lives hold ho lieutenantsirmontanogentlemen have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame why how now ho from whence ariseth this are we turnd turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety what is the matter masters honest iago that lookst dead with grieving speak who began this on thy love i charge thee i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at others breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it how comes it michael you are thus forgot i pray you pardon me i cannot speak worthy montano you were wont be civil the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure whats the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a nightbrawler give me answer to it worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can inform you while i spare speech which something now offends me of all that i do know nor know i aught by me thats said or done amiss this night unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgment collied assays to lead the way if i once stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approved in this offence though he had twinnd with me both at a birth shall lose me what in a town of war yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety tis monstrous iago who begant if partially affined or leagued in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamouras it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returnd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i neer might say before when i came back for this was briefi found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine reenter desdemona attended look if my gentle love be not raised up ill make thee an example whats the matter alls well now sweeting come away to bed sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon lead him off to montano who is led off iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted come desdemona tis the soldiers life to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife exeunt all but iago and cassio what are you hurt lieutenant ay past all surgery marry heaven forbid reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you i know not ist possible i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you i have well approved it sir i drunk you or any man living may be drunk at a time man ill tell you what you shall do our generals wife is now the general may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before you advise me well i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit and whats he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit shes framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moorweret to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetterd to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor ill pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her bodys lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all reenter roderigo how now roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time doest not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashierd cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress ill set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay thats the way dull not device by coldness and delay exit act iii scene i before the castle enter cassio and some musicians masters play here i will content your pains something thats brief and bid good morrow general music enter clown why masters have your instruments been in naples that they speak i the nose thus how sir how are these i pray you windinstruments ay marry are they sir o thereby hangs a tail whereby hangs a tale sir marry sir by many a windinstrument that i know but masters heres money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for loves sake to make no more noise with it well sir we will not if you have any music that may not be heard tot again but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care we have none such sir then put up your pipes in your bag for ill away go vanish into air away exeunt musicians dost thou hear my honest friend no i hear not your honest friend i hear you prithee keep up thy quillets theres a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring tell her theres one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech wilt thou do this she is stirring sir if she will stir hither i shall seem to notify unto her do good my friend exit clown enter iago in happy time iago you have not been abed then why no the day had broke before we parted i have made bold iago to send in to your wife my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access ill send her to you presently and ill devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free i humbly thank you fort exit iago i never knew a florentine more kind and honest enter emilia good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone pray you come in i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely i am much bound to you exeunt scene ii a room in the castle enter othello iago and gentlemen these letters give iago to the pilot and by him do my duties to the senate that done i will be walking on the works repair there to me well my good lord ill dot this fortification gentlemen shall we seet well wait upon your lordship exeunt scene iii the garden of the castle enter desdemona cassio and emilia be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband as if the case were his o thats an honest fellow do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were bounteous madam whatever shall become of michael cassio hes never any thing but your true servant i knowt i thank you you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no further off than in a polite distance ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship ill perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift ill intermingle every thing he does with cassios suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away madam here comes my lord madam ill take my leave why stay and hear me speak madam not now i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes well do your discretion exit cassio enter othello and iago ha i like not that what dost thou say nothing my lord or ifi know not what was not that cassio parted from my wife cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing you coming i do believe twas he how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure who ist you mean why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back went he hence now ay sooth so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back not now sweet desdemona some other time but shallt be shortly the sooner sweet for you shallt be tonight at supper no not tonight tomorrow dinner then i shall not dine at home i meet the captains at the citadel why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith hes penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason save that they say the wars must make examples out of their bestis not almost a fault to incur a private cheque when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mammering on what michael cassio that came awooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath taen your part to have so much to do to bring him in trust me i could do much prithee no more let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing why this is not a boon tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted i will deny thee nothing whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself shall i deny you no farewell my lord farewell my desdemona ill come to thee straight emilia come be as your fancies teach you whateer you be i am obedient exeunt desdemona and emilia excellent wretch perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again my noble lord what dost thou say iago did michael cassio when you wood my lady know of your love he did from first to last why dost thou ask but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm why of thy thought iago i did not think he had been acquainted with her o yes and went between us very oft indeed indeed ay indeed discernst thou aught in that is he not honest honest my lord honest ay honest my lord for aught i know what dost thou think think my lord think my lord by heaven he echoes me as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought my lord you know i love you i think thou dost and for i know thourt full of love and honesty and weighst thy words before thou givest them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man thats just they are close delations working from the heart that passion cannot rule for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest i think so too men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none certain men should be what they seem why then i think cassios an honest man nay yet theres more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false as wheres that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and lawdays and in session sit with meditations lawful thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but thinkst him wrongd and makest his ear a stranger to thy thoughts i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my natures plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom yet from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts what dost thou mean good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed by heaven ill know thy thoughts you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst tis in my custody ha o beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he oer who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves o misery poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy why why is this thinkst thou ild make a lie of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago ill see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of selfbounty be abused look tot i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leavet undone but keept unknown dost thou say so she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemd to shake and fear your looks she loved them most and so she did why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her fathers eyes up close as oak he thought twas witchcraftbut i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i am bound to thee for ever i see this hath a little dashd your spirits not a jot not a jot i faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see youre moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion i will not should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassios my worthy friend my lord i see youre moved no not much moved i do not think but desdemonas honest long live she so and long live you to think so and yet how nature erring from itself ay theres the point asto be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago going  my lord i take my leave why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds returning  my lord i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the mean time let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free i do beseech your honour fear not my government i once more take my leave exit this fellows of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings ild whistle her off and let her down the wind to pray at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of yearsyet thats not much shes gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken desdemona comes reenter desdemona and emilia if she be false o then heaven mocks itself ill not believet how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence i am to blame why do you speak so faintly are you not well i have a pain upon my forehead here faith thats with watching twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well your napkin is too little he puts the handkerchief from him and it drops let it alone come ill go in with you i am very sorry that you are not well exeunt othello and desdemona i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor my wayward husband hath a hundred times wood me to steal it but she so loves the token for he conjured her she should ever keep it that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to ill have the work taen out and givet iago what he will do with it heaven knows not i i nothing but to please his fantasy reenter iago how now what do you here alone do not you chide i have a thing for you a thing for me it is a common thing ha to have a foolish wife o is that all what will you give me now for the same handkerchief what handkerchief what handkerchief why that the moor first gave to desdemona that which so often you did bid me steal hast stoln it from her no faith she let it drop by negligence and to the advantage i being here tookt up look here it is a good wench give it me what will you do with t that you have been so earnest to have me filch it snatching it  why whats that to you if it be not for some purpose of import givet me again poor lady shell run mad when she shall lack it be not acknown on t i have use for it go leave me exit emilia i will in cassios lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so look where he comes reenter othello not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday ha ha false to me why how now general no more of that avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack i swear tis better to be much abused than but to knowt a little how now my lord what sense had i of her stoln hours of lust i sawt not thought it not it harmd not me i slept the next night well was free and merry i found not cassios kisses on her lips he that is robbd not wanting what is stoln let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all i am sorry to hear this i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal joves dead clamours counterfeit farewell othellos occupations gone ist possible my lord villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of mans eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath ist come to this make me to seet or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life my noble lord if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horrors head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool that livest to make thine honesty a vice o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe i thank you for this profit and from hence ill love no friend sith love breeds such offence nay stay thou shouldst be honest i should be wise for honestys a fool and loses that it works for by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not ill have some proof her name that was as fresh as dians visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams ill not endure it would i were satisfied i see sir you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied would nay i will and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her toppd death and damnation o it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say wheres satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you may havet give me a living reason shes disloyal i do not like the office but sith i am enterd in this cause so far prickd tot by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard as if he pluckd up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor o monstrous monstrous nay

fate would have me wive to give it her i did so and take heed ont make it a darling like your precious eye to loset or givet away were such perdition as nothing else could match ist possible tis true theres magic in the web of it a sibyl that had numberd in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sewd the work the worms were hallowd that did breed the silk and it

suffered will you hear me roderigo faith i have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin together you charge me most unjustly with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of my means the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but i find none well go to very well very well go to i cannot go to man nor tis not very well nay i think it is scurvy and begin to find myself fobbed in it very well i tell you tis not very well i will make myself known to desdemona if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you you have said now ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing why now i see theres mettle in thee and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before give me thy hand roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair it hath not appeared i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment but roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean purpose courage and valour this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life well what is it is it within reason and compass sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othellos place is that true why then othello and desdemona return again to venice o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio how do you mean removing of him why by making him uncapable of othellos place knocking out his brains and that you would have me to do ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him he knows not yet of his horrorable fortune if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us come stand not amazed at it but go along with me i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him it is now high suppertime and the night grows to waste about it i will hear further reason for this and you shall be satisfied exeunt scene iii another room in the castle enter othello lodovico desdemona emilia and attendants i do beseech you sir trouble yourself no

seen him so would not imy love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns prithee unpin mehave grace and favour in them i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed alls one good faith how foolish are our minds if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets come come you talk my mother had a maid calld barbara she was in love and he she loved proved mad and did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing twas but it expressd her fortune and she died singing it that song tonight will not go from my mind i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbara prithee dispatch shall i go fetch your nightgown no unpin me here this lodovico is a proper man a very handsome man he speaks well i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip singing  the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow the fresh streams ran by her and murmurd her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and softend the stones lay by these singing sing willow willow

wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world why would not you no by this heavenly light nor i neither by this heavenly light i might dot as well i the dark wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world the worlds a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice in troth i think thou wouldst not in troth i think i should and undot when i had done marry i would not do such a thing for a jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole worldwhy who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch i should venture purgatory fort beshrew me if i would do such a wrong for the whole world why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right i do not think there is any such woman yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for but i do think it is their husbands faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it that they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and doth affection breed it i think it doth ist frailty that thus errs it is so too and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so good night good night heaven me such uses send not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend exeunt act v scene i cyprus a street enter iago and roderigo here stand behind this bulk straight will he come wear thy good rapier bare and put it home quick quick fear

and full of face as heaven had lent her all his grace with whom the father liking took and her to incest did provoke bad child worse father to entice his own to evil should be done by none but custom what they did begin was with long use account no sin the beauty of this sinful dame made many princes thither frame to seek her as a bedfellow in marriagepleasures playfellow which to prevent he made a law to keep her still and men in awe that whoso askd her for his wife his riddle told not lost his life so for her many a wight did die as yon grim looks do testify what now ensues to the judgment

thoughts revolt for hes no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who fingerd to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being playd upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you prince pericles touch not upon thy life for thats an article within our law as dangerous as the rest your times expired either expound now or receive your sentence great king few love to hear the sins they love to act twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do hes more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wandering wind blows dust in others eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts coppd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throngd by mans

tune us otherwise forty days longer we do respite you if by which time our secret be undone this mercy shows well joy in such a son and until then your entertain shall be as doth befit our honour and your worth exeunt all but pericles how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now youre both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasure fits an husband not a father and she an eater of her mothers flesh by the defiling of her parents bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will shun no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murders as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the

we mean to have his head he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy nor tell the world antiochus doth sin in such a loathed manner and therefore instantly this prince must die for by his fall my honour must keep high who attends us there enter thaliard doth your highness call thaliard you are of our chamber and our mind partakes her private actions to your secrecy and for your faithfulness we

court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i feard is at antioch whose aim seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasures art can joy my spirits nor yet the others distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have afternourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus gainst whom i am too little to contend since hes so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honour him if he suspect i may dishonour him and what may make him blush in being known hell stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces hell oerspread the land and with the ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquishd ere they do resist and subjects punishd that neer thought offence which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my body pine and soul to languish and punish that before that he would punish enter helicanus with other lords joy and all comfort in your sacred breast and keep your mind till you return to us peaceful and comfortable peace peace and give experience tongue they do abuse the king that flatter him for flattery is the bellows blows up sin the thing which is flatterd but a spark to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing whereas reproof obedient and in order fits kings as they are men for they may err when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace he flatters you makes war upon your life prince pardon me or strike me if you please i cannot be much lower than my knees all leave us else but let your cares oerlook what shipping and what ladings in our haven and then return to us exeunt lords helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks an angry brow dread lord if there be such a dart in princes frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence they have their nourishment thou knowst i have power to take thy life from thee kneeling i have ground the axe myself do you but strike the blow rise prithee rise sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for it and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid fit counsellor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do to bear with patience such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself thou speakst like a physician helicanus that ministerst a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch where as thou knowst against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the resthark in thine earas black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemd not to strike but smooth but thou knowst this tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss such fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seemd my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth that i should open to the listening air how many worthy princes bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt hell fill this land with arms and make pretence of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call offence must feel wars blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reprovest me for it alas sir drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve them well my lord since you have given me leave to speak freely will i speak antiochus you fear and justly too i think you fear the tyrant who either by public war or private treason will take away your life therefore my lord go travel for a while till that his rage and anger be forgot or till the destinies do cut his thread of life your rule direct to any if to me day serves not light more faithful than ill be i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence well mingle our bloods together

place of general wonder but alack that monster envy oft the wrack of earned praise marinas life seeks to take off by treasons knife and in this kind hath our cleon one daughter and a wench full grown even ripe for marriagerite this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be bet when she weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to the lute she sung and made the nightbird mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given this so darks in philoten all graceful marks that cleons wife with envy rare a present murderer does prepare for good marina that her daughter might stand peerless

demand his child that she is dead nurses are not the fates to foster it nor ever to preserve she died at night ill say so who can cross it unless you play the pious innocent and for an honest attribute cry out she died by foul play o go to well well of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods do like this worst be one of those that think the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence and open this to pericles i do shame to think of what a noble strain you are and of how coward a spirit to such proceeding who ever but his approbation added though not his prime consent he did not flow from honourable sources be it so then yet none does know but you how she came dead nor none can know leonine being gone she did disdain my child and stood between her and her fortunes none would look on her but cast their gazes on marinas face whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day it pierced me through and though you call my course unnatural you not your child well loving yet i find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness performd to your sole daughter heavens forgive it and as for pericles what should he say we wept after her hearse and yet we mourn her

made this slaughter marina was she calld and at her birth thetis being proud swallowd some part o the earth therefore the earth fearing to be oerflowd hath thetis birthchild on the heavens bestowd wherefore she does and swears shell never stint make raging battery upon shores of flint no visor does become black villany so well as soft and tender flattery let pericles believe his daughters dead

here accuse my zeal tis not the trial of a womans war the bitter clamour of two eager tongues can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain the blood is hot that must be coold for this yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be hushd and nought at all to say first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and spurs to my free speech which else would post until it had

lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was surveyd by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucesters death suggest his soonbelieving adversaries and consequently like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood like sacrificing abels cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth to me for justice and rough chastisement and by the glorious worth of my descent this arm shall do it or this life be spent how high a pitch his resolution soars thomas of norfolk what sayst thou to this o let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf till i have told this slander of his blood how

my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it and exactly beggd your graces pardon and i hope i had it this is my fault as for the rest appealld it issues from the rancour of a villain a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitors foot to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom in haste whereof most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me lets purge this choler without letting blood

trumpets sound while we return these dukes what we decree a long flourish draw near and list what with our council we have done for that our kingdoms earth should not be soild with that dear blood which it hath fostered and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds ploughd up with neighbours sword and for we think the eaglewinged pride of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts with rivalhating envy set on you to wake our peace which in our countrys cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray and grating shock of wrathful iron arms might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindreds blood therefore we banish you our territories you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers have enrichd our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions but tread the stranger paths of banishment your will be done this must my comfort be sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom which i with some unwillingness pronounce the sly slow hours shall not determinate the dateless limit of thy dear exile the hopeless word of never to return breathe i against thee upon pain of life a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlookd for from your highness mouth a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deserved at your highness hands the language i have learnd these forty years my native english now i must forego and now my tongues use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony within my mouth you have engaold my tongue doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath it boots thee not to be compassionate after our sentence plaining comes too late then thus i turn me from my countrys light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night return again and take an oath with thee lay on our royal sword your banishd hands swear by the duty that you owe to god our part therein we banish with yourselves to keep the oath that we administer you never shall so help you truth and god embrace each others love in banishment

sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banishd from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burthen of a guilty soul no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banishd as from hence but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue farewell my liege now no way can i stray save back to england all the worlds my way exit uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banishd years pluckd four away to henry bolingbroke six frozen winter spent return with welcome home from banishment how long a time lies in one little word four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my sons exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oildried lamp and timebewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son why uncle thou hast many years to live but not a minute king that thou canst give shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou canst help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath thy son is banishd upon good advice whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave why at our justice seemst thou then to lour things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour you urged me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroyd alas i lookd when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong cousin farewell and uncle bid him so six years we banish him and he shall go flourish exeunt king richard ii and train cousin farewell what presence must not know from where you do remain let paper show my lord no leave take i for i will ride as far as land will let me by your side o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou returnst no greeting to thy friends i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongues office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart thy grief is but thy absence for a time joy absent grief is present for that time what is six winters they are quickly gone to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an inforced pilgrimage the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity think not the king did banish thee but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime look what thy soul holds dear imagine it to lie that way thou gost not whence thou comest suppose the singing birds musicians the grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summers heat o no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites but lanceth not the sore come come my son ill bring thee on thy way had i thy youth and cause i would not stay then englands ground

highway and there i left him and say what store of parting tears were shed faith none for me except the northeast wind which then blew bitterly against our faces awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear what said our cousin when you parted with him farewell and for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane the word that taught me craft to counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seemd buried in my sorrows grave marry would the word farewell have lengthend hours and added years to his short banishment he should have had a volume of farewells but since it would not he had none of me he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt when time shall call him home from banishment whether our kinsman come to see his friends ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor

tempest sing yet see no shelter to avoid the storm we see the wind sit sore upon our sails and yet we strike not but securely perish we see the very wreck that we must suffer and unavoided is the danger now for suffering so the causes of our wreck not so even through the hollow eyes of death i spy life peering but i dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours be confident to speak northumberland we three are but thyself and speaking so thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold then thus i have from port le blanc a bay in

myself i cannot do it yet i know no cause why i should welcome such a guest as grief save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard yet again methinks some unborn sorrow ripe in fortunes womb is coming towards me and my inward soul with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves more than with parting from my lord the king each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows which shows like grief itself but is not so for sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears divides one thing entire to many objects like perspectives which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion eyed awry distinguish form so your sweet majesty looking awry upon your lords departure find shapes of grief more than himself to wail which lookd on as it is is nought but shadows of what it is not then thricegracious queen more than your lords departure weep not mores not seen or if it be tis with false sorrows eye which for things true weeps things imaginary it may be so but yet my inward soul persuades me it is otherwise howeer it be i cannot but be sad so heavy sad as though on thinking on no thought i think makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady tis nothing less conceit is still derived from some forefather grief mine is not so for nothing had begot my something grief or something hath the nothing that i grieve tis in reversion that i do possess but what it is that is not yet known what i cannot name tis nameless woe i wot enter green god save your majesty and well met gentlemen i hope the king is not yet shippd for ireland why hopest

that is worse the lord northumberland his son young henry percy the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby with all their powerful friends are fled to him why have you not proclaimd northumberland and

art the midwife to my woe and bolingbroke my sorrows dismal heir now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy and i a gasping newdeliverd mother have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joind despair not madam who shall hinder me i will despair and be at enmity with cozening hope he is a flatterer a parasite a keeper back of death who gently would dissolve the bands of life which false hope lingers in extremity enter duke of york here comes the duke of york with signs of war about his aged neck o full of careful business are his looks uncle for gods sake speak comfortable words should i do so i

is left at six and seven exeunt duke of york and queen the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland but none returns for us to levy power proportionable to the enemy is all unpossible besides our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king and thats the wavering commons for their love lies in their purses and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate wherein the king stands generally condemnd if judgement lie in them then so do we because we ever have been near the king well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle the earl of wiltshire is already there thither will i with you for little office the hateful commons will perform for us except like curs to tear us all to pieces will you go along with us no i will to ireland to

enter henry bolingbroke and northumberland with forces how far is it my lord to berkeley now believe me noble lord i am a stranger here in gloucestershire these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles and makes them wearisome and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar making the hard way sweet and delectable but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found in ross and willoughby wanting your company which i protest hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoyd by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short as mine hath done by sight of what i have your noble company of much less value is my company than your good words but who comes here enter henry percy it is my son young harry percy sent from my brother worcester whencesoever harry how fares your uncle i had thought my lord to have learnd his health of you why is he not with the queen no my good lord he hath forsook the court broken his staff of office and dispersed the household of the king what was his reason he was not so resolved when last we spake together because your lordship was proclaimed traitor but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh to offer service to the duke of hereford and sent me over by berkeley to discover what power the duke of york had levied there then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh have you forgot the duke of hereford boy no my good lord for that is not forgot which neer i did remember to my knowledge i never in my life did look on him then learn to know him now this is the duke my gracious lord i tender you my service such as it is being tender raw and young which elder days shall ripen and confirm to more approved service and desert i thank thee gentle percy and be sure i count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul remembering my good friends and as my fortune ripens with thy love it shall be still thy true loves recompense my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it how far is it to berkeley and what stir keeps good old york there with his

unfelt thanks which more enrichd shall be your love and labours recompense your presence makes us rich most noble lord and far surmounts our labour to attain it evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor which till my infant fortune comes to years stands for my bounty but who comes here enter lord berkeley it is my lord of berkeley as i guess my lord of hereford my message is to you my lord my answer isto lancaster and i am come to seek that name in england and i must find that title in your tongue before i make reply to aught you say mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning to raze one

knee whose duty is deceiveable and false my gracious uncle tut tut grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle i am no traitors uncle and that word grace in an ungracious mouth is but profane why have those banishd and forbidden legs dared once to touch a dust of englands ground but then more why why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom frighting her palefaced villages with war and ostentation of despised arms comest thou because the anointed king is hence why foolish boy the king is left behind and in my loyal bosom lies his power were i but now the lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt thy father and myself rescued the black prince that young mars of men from forth the ranks of many thousand french o then how quickly should this arm of mine now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee and minister correction to thy fault my gracious uncle let me know my fault on what condition stands it and wherein even in condition of the worst degree in gross rebellion and detested treason thou art a banishd man and here art come before the expiration of thy time in braving arms against thy sovereign as i was banishd i was banishd hereford but as i come i come for lancaster and noble uncle i beseech your grace look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye you are my father for methinks in you i see old gaunt alive o then my father will you permit that i shall stand

i am denied to sue my livery here and yet my letterspatents give me leave my fathers goods are all distraind and sold and these and all are all amiss employd what would you have me do i am a subject and i challenge law attorneys are denied me and therefore personally i lay my claim to my inheritance of free descent the noble duke hath been too much abused it stands your grace upon to do him right base men by his endowments are made great my lords of england let me tell you this i have had feeling of my cousins wrongs and laboured all i could to do him right but in this kind to come in braving arms be his own carver and cut out his way to find out right with wrong it may not be and you that do abet him in this kind cherish rebellion and are rebels all the noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own and for the right of that we all have strongly sworn to give him aid and let him neer see joy that breaks that oath well well i see the issue of these arms i cannot mend it i must needs confess because my power is weak and all ill left but if i could by him that gave me life i would attach you all and make you stoop unto the sovereign mercy of the king but since i cannot be it known to you i do remain as neuter so fare you well unless you please to enter in the castle and there repose you for this night an offer uncle that we will accept but we must win your grace to go with us to bristol castle which they say is held by bushy bagot and their complices the caterpillars of the commonwealth which i have sworn to weed and pluck away it may be i will go with you but yet

unhappied and disfigured clean you have in manner with your sinful hours made a divorce betwixt his queen and him broke the possession of a royal bed and staind the beauty of a fair queens cheeks with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs myself a prince by fortune of my birth near to the king in blood and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me have stoopd my neck under your injuries and sighd my english breath in foreign clouds eating the bitter bread of banishment whilst you have fed upon my signories disparkd my parks and felld my forest woods from my own windows torn my household coat razed out my imprese leaving me no sign save mens opinions and my living blood to show the world i am a gentleman this and much more much more than twice all this condemns you to the

with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favours with my royal hands feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavygaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellions arms fear not my lord that power that made you king hath power to keep you king in spite of all the means that heaven yields must be embraced and not neglected else if heaven would and we will not heavens offer we refuse the profferd means of succor and redress he means my lord that we are too remiss whilst bolingbroke through our security grows strong and great in substance and in power discomfortable cousin knowst thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath revelld in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressd to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right enter earl of salisbury welcome my lordhow far off lies your power nor near nor

woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day glad am i that your highness is so armd to bear the tidings of calamity like an unseasonable stormy day which makes the silver rivers drown their shores as if the world were all dissolved to tears so high above his limits swells the rage of bolingbroke covering your fearful land with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel whitebeards have armd their thin and hairless scalps against thy majesty boys with womens voices strive to speak big and clap their female joints in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown

executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbrokes and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for gods sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd all murderd for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feard and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit

alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass i that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtaild of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair wellspoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true

the crossrow plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now why this it is when men are ruled by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliverd

somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner thou art the cause and most accursed effect your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom if i thought that i tell thee homicide these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks these eyes could never endure sweet beautys wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day

would they were basilisks to strike thee dead i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspect with store of childish drops these eyes that never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my fathers death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standersby had wet their cheeks like trees bedashd with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak she looks scornfully at him teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but twas thy beauty that provoked me nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward but twas thy heavenly face that set me on here she lets fall the sword take up the sword again or take up me arise dissembler though i wish thy death i will not be the executioner then bid me kill myself and i will do it i have already tush that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word that hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary i would i knew thy heart tis figured in my tongue i fear me both are false then never man was true well well put up your sword say then my peace is made that shall you know hereafter but shall i live in hope all men i hope live so vouchsafe to wear this ring to take is not to give look how this ring encompasseth finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted suppliant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever what is it that it would please thee leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby place

brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil enter two murderers but soft here come my executioners how now my hardy stout resolved mates are you now going to dispatch this deed we are my lord and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is well thought upon i have it here about me gives the warrant when you have done repair to

go go dispatch we will my noble lord exeunt scene iv london the tower enter clarence and brakenbury why looks your grace so heavily today o i have passd a miserable night so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time what was your dream i long to hear you tell it methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embarkd to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befalln us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main lord lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears what ugly sights of death within mine eyes methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatterd in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems which wood the slimy bottom of the deep and mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood kept in my soul and would not let it forth to seek the empty vast and wandering air but smotherd it within my panting bulk which almost burst to belch it in the sea awaked you not with this sore agony o no my dream was lengthend after life o then began the tempest to my soul who passd methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick who cried aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanishd then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environd me about and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling waked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made the dream no marvel my lord though it affrighted you i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it o brakenbury i have done those things which now bear evidence against my soul for edwards sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep i will my lord god give your grace good rest clarence sleeps sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide night princes have but their tides for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imagination they often feel a world of restless cares so that betwixt their tides and low names theres nothing differs but the outward fame enter the two murderers ho whos here in gods name what are you and how came you hither i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs yea are you so brief o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show him our commission talk no more brakenbury reads it i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands i will not reason what is meant hereby because i will be guiltless of the meaning here are the keys there sits the duke asleep ill to the king and signify to him that thus i have resignd my charge to you do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well exit brakenbury what shall we stab him as he sleeps no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till the judgmentday why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me what art thou afraid not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us i thought thou hadst been resolute so i am to let him live back to the duke of gloucester tell him so i pray thee stay a while i hope my holy humour will change twas wont to hold me but while one would tell twenty how dost thou feel thyself now faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me remember our reward when the deed is done zounds he dies i had forgot the reward where is thy conscience now in the duke of gloucesters purse so when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out let it go theres few or none will entertain it how if it come to thee again ill not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him he cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that i found it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh tut i am strongframed he cannot prevail with me i warrant thee spoke like a tail fellow that respects his reputation come shall we to this gear take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt in the next room o excellent devise make a sop of him hark he stirs shall i strike no first lets reason with him where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine you shall have wine enough my lord anon in gods name what art thou a man as you are but not as i am royal nor you as we are loyal thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble my voice is now the kings my looks mine own how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak your eyes do menace me why look you pale who sent you hither wherefore do you come to to to to murder me ay ay you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it wherein my friends have i offended you offended us you have not but the king i shall be reconciled to him again never my lord therefore prepare to die are you calld forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent what is my offence where are the evidence that do accuse me what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence death before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable what we will do we do upon command and he that hath commanded is the king erroneous vassal the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands to hurl upon their heads that break his law and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the holy sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster and like a traitor to the name of god didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade unripdst the bowels of thy sovereigns son whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend how canst thou urge gods dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in so dear degree alas for whose sake did i that ill deed for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i if god will be revenged for this deed o know you yet he doth it publicly take not the quarrel from his powerful arm he needs no indirect nor lawless course to cut off those that have offended him who made thee then a bloody minister when

oh if you love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well if you be hired for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you o no he loves me and he holds me dear go you to him from me ay so we will tell him when that our princely father york blessd his three sons with his victorious arm and charged us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship bid gloucester think of this and he will weep ay millstones as be lessond us to weep o do not slander him for he is kind right as snow in harvest thou deceivest thyself tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee it cannot be for when i parted with him he huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labour my delivery why so he doth now he delivers thee from this worlds thraldom to the joys of heaven make peace with god for you must die my lord hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul to counsel me to make my peace with god and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind that thou wilt war with god by murdering me ah sirs consider he that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed what shall we do relent and save your souls relent tis cowardly and womanish not to relent is beastly savage devilish which of you if you were a princes son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities not look behind you my lord take that and that if all this will not do

with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetchd hither to london to be crownd our king why with some little train my lord of buckingham marry my lord lest by a multitude the newheald wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me and so in me and so i think in all yet since it is but green it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach which haply by much company might be urged therefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince and so say i then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow madam and you my mother will you go to give your censures in this weighty

there is a hope of government that in his nonage council under him and in his full and ripend years himself no doubt shall then and till then govern well so stood the state when henry the sixth was crownd in paris but at nine months old stood the state so no no good friends god wot for then this land was famously enrichd with politic grave counsel then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace why so hath this both by the father and mother better it were they all came by the father or by the father there were none at all for emulation now who shall be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not o full of danger is the duke of gloucester and the queens sons and brothers haught and proud and were they to be ruled and not to rule this sickly land might solace as before come come we fear the worst all shall be well when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks when great leaves fall the winter is at hand when the sun sets who doth not look for night untimely storms make men expect a dearth all may be well but if god sort it so tis more than we deserve or i expect truly the souls of men are full of dread ye cannot reason almost with a man that looks not heavily

if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory can from his mother win the duke of york anon expect him here but if she be obdurate to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin you are too senselessobstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claimd it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children neer till now my lord you shall oerrule my mind for once come on lord hastings will you go with me i go my lord good lords make all the speedy haste you may exeunt cardinal and hastings say uncle gloucester if our brother come where shall we sojourn till our coronation where it seems best unto your royal

so wise so young they say do never live long what say you uncle i say without characters fame lives long aside thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word that julius caesar

makes me most forward in this noble presence to doom the offenders whatsoever they be i say my lord they have deserved death then be your eyes the witness of this ill see how i am bewitchd behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling witherd up and this is edwards wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me if they have done this thing my gracious lord if i thou protector of this damned strumpet tellest thou me of ifs  thou art a traitor off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same lovel and ratcliff look that it be done the rest that love me rise and follow me exeunt all but hastings ratcliff and lovel woe woe for england not a whit for me for i too fond might have prevented this stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm but i disdaind it and did scorn to fly three times today my footcloth horse did stumble and startled when he lookd upon the tower as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse o now i want the priest that spake to me i now repent i told the pursuivant as twere triumphing at mine enemies how they at pomfret bloodily were butcherd and i myself secure in grace and favour o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings wretched head dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner make a short shrift he longs to see your head o momentary grace of mortal men which we more hunt for than the grace of god who builds his hopes in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim o bloody richard miserable england i prophesy the fearfulst time to thee that ever wretched age hath lookd upon come lead me to the block bear him my head they smile at me that shortly shall be dead exeunt scene v the towerwalls enter gloucester and buckingham in rotten armour marvellous illfavoured come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in the middle of a word and then begin again and stop again as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems but what is catesby gone he is and see he brings the mayor along enter the lord mayor and catesby lord mayor look to the drawbridge there hark a drum catesby oerlook the walls lord mayor the reason we have sent look back defend thee here are enemies god and our innocency defend and guard us be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings head here is the head of that ignoble traitor the dangerous and unsuspected hastings so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shores wife he lived from all attainder of suspect well well he was the covertst shelterd traitor that ever lived would you imagine or almost believe weret not that by great preservation we live to tell it you the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the councilhouse to murder me and my good lord of gloucester what had he so what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villains death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforced us to this execution now fair befall you he deserved his death and you my good lords both have well proceeded to warn false traitors from the like attempts i never lookd for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning have prevented because my lord we would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death but my good lord your graces word shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak and doubt you not right noble princes both but ill acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this cause and to that end we wishd your lordship here to avoid the carping censures of the world but since you come too late of our intents yet witness what you hear we did intend and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell exit lord mayor go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetst advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edwards children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants daughters wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control listed to make his prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly as twere far off because you know my lord my mother lives fear not my lord ill play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu if you thrive well bring them to baynards castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops i go and towards three or four oclock look for the news that the guildhall affords exit buckingham go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw to catesby go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynards castle exeunt all but gloucester now will i in to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes exit scene vi the same enter a scrivener with a paper in his hand this is the indictment of the good lord hastings which in a set hand fairly is engrossd that it may be this day read over in pauls and mark how well the sequel hangs together eleven hours i spent to write it over for yesternight by catesby was it brought me the precedent was full as long adoing and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings untainted unexamined free at liberty heres a good world the while why whos so gross that seeth not this palpable device yet whos so blind but says he sees it not bad is the world and all will come to nought when such bad dealings must be seen in thought exit scene vii baynards castle enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors how now my lord what say the citizens now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum and speak not a word touchd you the bastardy of edwards children i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france the insatiate greediness of his desires and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your dicipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose untouchd or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory grew to an end i bid them that did love their countrys good cry god save richard englands royal king ah and did they so no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones gazed each on other and lookd deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and askd the mayor what meant this wilful silence his answer was the people were not wont to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd but nothing spake in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at the lower end of the hall hurld up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and loving shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard and even here brake off and came away what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak no by my troth my lord will not the mayor then and his brethren come the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayerbook in your hand and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord for on that ground ill build a holy descant and be not easily won to our request play the maids part still answer nay and take it i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt well bring it to a happy issue go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks exit gloucester enter the lord mayor and citizens welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal enter catesby here comes his servant how now catesby what says he my lord he doth entreat your grace to visit him tomorrow or next day he is within with two right reverend fathers divinely bent to meditation and no worldly suit would he be moved to draw him from his holy exercise return good catesby to thy lord again tell him myself the mayor and citizens in deep designs and matters of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace ill tell him what you say my lord exit ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd daybed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this gracious prince take on himself the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall neer win him to it marry god forbid his grace should say us nay i fear he will reenter catesby how now catesby what says your lord my lord he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him his grace not being warnd thereof before my lord he fears you mean no good to him sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven i come in perfect love to him and so once more return and tell his grace exit catesby when holy and devout religious men are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation enter gloucester aloft between two bishops catesby returns see where he stands between two clergymen two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ears to our request and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal my lord there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me who earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your graces pleasure even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovernd isle i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the citys eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance you have my lord would it might please your grace at our entreaties to amend that fault else wherefore breathe i in a christian land then know it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the scepterd office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our countrys good this noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shoulderd in the swallowing gulf of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for anothers gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just suit come i to move your grace i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tonguetied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasond with your faithful love to me then on the other side i chequed my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smotherd but god be thankd theres no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered you say that edward is your brothers son so say we too but not by edwards wife for first he was contract to lady lucy your mother lives a witness to that vow and afterward by substitute betrothd to bona sister to the king of france these both put by a poor petitioner a carecrazed mother of a many children a beautywaning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his lustful eye seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners term the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this profferd benefit of dignity if non to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal truederived course do good my lord your citizens entreat you refuse not mighty lord this profferd love o make them joyful grant their lawful suit alas why would you heap these cares on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you if you refuse itas in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brothers son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kin and egally indeed to all estates yet whether you accept our suit or no your brothers son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you come citizens zounds ill entreat no more o do not swear my lord of buckingham exit buckingham with the citizens call them again my lord and accept their suit do good my lord lest all the land do rue it would you enforce me to a world of care well call them again i am not made of stone but penetrable to your kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul reenter buckingham and the rest cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof god bless your grace we see it and will say it in saying so you shall but say the truth then i salute you with this kingly title long live richard englands royal king amen tomorrow will it please you to be crownd even when you please since you will have it so tomorrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave come let us to our holy task again farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends exeunt act iv scene i

quick conveyance with her good aunt anne come come you mock me this is not the way to win our daughter there is no other way unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be richard that hath done all this say that i did all this for love of her nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil look what is done cannot be now amended men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes which after hours give leisure to repent if i did take the kingdom from your sons to make amends ill give it to your daughter if i have killd the issue of your womb to quicken your increase i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter a grandams name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother they are as children but one step below even of your mettle of your very blood of an one pain save for a night of groans endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow your children were vexation to your youth but mine shall be a comfort to your age the loss you have is but a son being king and by that loss your daughter is made queen i cannot make you what amends i would therefore accept such kindness as i can dorset your son that with a fearful soul leads discontented steps in foreign soil this fair alliance quickly shall call home to high promotions and great dignity the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife familiarly shall call thy dorset brother again shall you be mother to a king and all the ruins of distressful times repaird with double riches of content what we have many goodly days to see the liquid drops of tears that you

your experience prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale put in her tender heart the aspiring flame of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys and when this arm of mine hath chastised the petty rebel dullbraind buckingham bound with triumphant garlands will i come and lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed to whom i will retail my conquest won and she shall be sole victress caesars caesar what were i best to say her fathers brother would be her lord or shall i say her uncle or he that slew her brothers and her uncles under what title shall i woo for thee that god the law my honour and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years infer fair englands peace by this alliance which she shall purchase with still lasting war say that the king which may command entreats that at her hands which the kings king forbids say she shall be a high and mighty queen to wail the tide as her mother doth say i will love her everlastingly but how long shall that title ever last sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last so long as heaven and nature lengthens it so long as hell and richard likes of it say i her sovereign am her subject love but she your subject loathes such sovereignty be eloquent in my behalf to her an honest tale speeds best being plainly told then in plain terms tell her my loving

may one ask i dreamd a dream tonight and so did i well what was yours that dreamers often lie in bed asleep while they do dream things true o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agatestone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart mens noses as they lie asleep her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers the traces of the smallest spiders web the collars of the moonshines watery beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her wagoner a small greycoated gnat not so big as a round little worm prickd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths fivefathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she peace peace mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and

greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excused then say at once what thou dost know in this i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife i married them and their stoln marriageday was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothd and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutord by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowd grave being the time the potions force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayd by accident and yesternight returnd my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law we still have known thee for a holy man wheres romeos man what can he say in this i brought my master news of juliets death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument this letter he early bid me give his father and threatened me with death going in the vault i departed not and left him there give me the letter i will look on it where is the countys page that raised the watch sirrah what made your master in this place he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughters jointure for no more can i demand but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that while verona by that name is known there shall

muscadel and threw the sops all in the sextons face having no other reason but that his beard grew thin and hungerly and seemd to ask him sops as he was drinking this done he took the bride about the

what foul play had we that we came from thence or blessed wast we did both both my girl by foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence but blessedly holp hither o my heart bleeds to think o the teen that i have turnd you to which is from my remembrance please you farther my brother and thy uncle calld antonio i pray thee mark methat a brother should be so perfidioushe whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle dost thou attend me sir most heedfully being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who to advance and who to trash for overtopping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed em or else new formd em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i the state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and suckd my verdure out ont thou attendst not o good sir i do i pray thee mark me i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired oerprized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing dost thou hear your tale sir would cure deafness to have no screen between this part he playd and him he playd it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbowdalas poor milan to most ignoble stooping o the heavens mark his condition and the event then tell me if this might be a brother i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs have borne bad sons now the condition the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit which was that he in lieu o the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self alack for pity i not remembering how i cried out then will cry it oer again it is a hint that wrings mine eyes tot hear a little further and then ill bring thee to the present business which nows upons without the which this story were most impertinent wherefore did they not that hour destroy us well demanded wench my

aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat not riggd nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively had quit it there they hoist us to cry to the sea that roard to us to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong alack what trouble was i then to you o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deckd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groand which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue how came we ashore by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnishd me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom would i might but

he or adrian for a good wager first begins to crow the old cock the cockerel done the wager a laughter a match though this island seem to be desert ha ha ha so youre paid uninhabitable and almost inaccessible yet yet he could not misst it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance temperance was a delicate wench ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered the air breathes upon us here most sweetly as if it had lungs and rotten ones or as twere perfumed by a fen here is everything advantageous to life true save means to live of that theres none or little how lush and lusty the grass looks how green the ground indeed is tawny with an eye of green int he misses not much no he doth but mistake the truth totally but the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost beyond credit as many vouched rarities are that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather newdyed than stained with salt water if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies ay or very falsely pocket up his report methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the kings fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen not since widow didos time widow a pox o that how came that widow in widow dido what if he had said widower aeneas too good lord how you take it widow dido said you you make me study of that she was of carthage not of tunis this tunis sir was carthage carthage i assure you carthage his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath raised the wall and houses too what impossible matter will he make easy next i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands ay why in good time sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queen and the rarest that eer came there bate i beseech you widow dido o widow dido ay widow dido is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it i mean in a sort that sort was well fished for when i wore it at your daughters marriage you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense would i had never married my daughter there for coming thence my son is lost and in my rate she too who is so far from italy removed i neer again shall see her o thou mine heir of naples and of milan what strange fish hath made his meal on thee sir he may live i saw him beat the surges under him and ride upon their backs he trod the water whose enmity he flung aside and breasted the surge most swoln that met him his bold head bove the contentious waves he kept and oard himself with his good arms in lusty stroke to the shore that oer his waveworn basis bowd as stooping to relieve him i not doubt he came alive to land no no hes gone sir you may thank yourself for this great loss that would not bless our europe with your daughter but rather lose her to an african where she at least is banishd from your eye who hath cause to wet the grief ont prithee peace you were kneeld to and importuned otherwise by all of us and the fair soul herself weighd between loathness and obedience at which end o the beam should bow we have lost your son i fear for ever milan and naples have more widows in them of this business making than we bring men to comfort them the faults your own so is the dearst o the loss my lord sebastian the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster very well and most chirurgeonly it is foul weather in us all good sir when you are cloudy foul weather very foul had i plantation of this isle my lord held sowt with nettleseed or docks or mallows and were the king ont what would i do scape being drunk for want

contract succession bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none no use of metal corn or wine or oil no occupation all men idle all and women too but innocent and pure no sovereignty yet he would be king ont the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavour treason felony sword pike knife gun or need of any engine would i not have but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison all abundance to feed my innocent people no marrying mong his subjects none man all idle whores and knaves i would with such perfection govern sir to excel the golden age god save his majesty long live gonzalo anddo you mark me sir prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me i do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing twas you we laughed at who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still what a blow was there given an it had not fallen flatlong you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it

face what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head what art thou waking do you not hear me speak i do and surely it is a sleepy language and thou speakst out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say this is a strange repose to be asleep with eyes wide open standing speaking moving and yet so fast asleep noble sebastian thou letst thy fortune sleepdie rather winkst whiles thou art waking thou dost snore distinctly theres meaning in thy snores i am more serious than my custom you must be so too if heed me which to do trebles thee oer well i am standing water ill teach you how to flow do so to ebb hereditary sloth instructs me o if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it you more invest it ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth prithee say on the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim a matter from thee and a birth indeed which throes thee much to yield thus sir although this lord of weak remembrance this who shall be of as little memory when he is earthd hath here almost persuade for hes a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuadethe king his sons alive tis as impossible that hes undrownd and he that sleeps here swims i have no hope that hes undrownd o out of that no hope what great hope have you no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond but doubt discovery there will you grant with me that ferdinand is drownd hes gone then tell me whos the next heir

he that sleeps lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this gonzalo i myself could make a chough of as deep chat o that you bore the mind that i do what a sleep were this for your advancement do you understand me methinks i do and how does your content tender your own good fortune i remember you did supplant your brother prospero true and look how well my garments sit upon me much feater than before my brothers servants were then my fellows now they are my men but for your conscience ay sir where lies that if twere a kibe twould put me to my slipper but i feel not this

both in naples the king and queen there that they were i wish myself were mudded in that oozy bed where my son lies when did you lose your daughter in this last tempest i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth their words are natural breath but howsoeer you have been justled from your senses know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely upon this shore where you were wreckd was landed to be the lord ont no more yet of this for tis a

good boy wink at me and say thou sawest me not fare thee well ist possible the world should so much differ and we alive that lived fly damned baseness to him that worships thee throwing the money back ha now i see thou art a fool and fit for thy master exit may these add to the number that may scald thee let moulten coin be thy damnation thou disease of a friend and not himself has friendship such a faint and milky heart it turns in less than two nights o you gods i feel masters passion this slave unto his honour has my lords meat in him why should it thrive and turn to nutriment when he is turnd to poison o may diseases only work upont and when hes sick to death let not that part of nature which my lord paid for be of any power to expel sickness but prolong his hour exit scene ii a public place enter lucilius with three strangers who the lord timon he is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman we know him for no less though we are but strangers to him but i can tell you one thing my lord and which i hear from common rumours now lord timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money but believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely fort and showed what necessity belonged tot and yet was denied how i tell you denied my lord what a strange case was that now before the gods i am ashamed ont denied that honourable man there was very little honour showed int for my own part i must needs confess i have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and suchlike trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me i should neer have denied his occasion so many talents enter servilius see by good hap yonders my lord i have sweat to see his honour my honoured lord to lucius servilius you are kindly met sir fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend may it please your honour my lord hath sent ha what has he sent i am so much endeared to that lord hes ever sending how shall i thank him thinkest thou and what has he sent now has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents i know his lordship is but merry with me he cannot want fifty five hundred talents but in the mean time he wants less my lord if his occasion were not virtuous i should not urge it half so faithfully dost thou speak seriously servilius upon my soultis true sir what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself against such a good time when i might ha shown myself honourable how unluckily it happened that i should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honoured servilius now before the gods i am not able to dothe more beast i sayi was sending to use lord timon myself these gentlemen can witness but i would not for the wealth of athens i had donet now commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because i have no power to be kind and tell him this from me i count it one of my greatest afflictions say that i cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman good servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him yes sir i shall ill look you out a good turn servilius exit servilius true as you said timon is shrunk indeed and he thats once denied will hardly speed exit do you observe this hostilius ay too well why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece is every flatterers spirit who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish for in my knowing timon has been this lords father and kept his credit with his purse supported his estate nay timons money has paid his men their wages he neer drinks but timons silver treads upon his lip and yeto see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape he does deny him in respect of his what charitable men afford to beggars religion groans at it for mine own part i never tasted timon in my life nor came any of his bounties over me to mark me for his friend yet i protest for his right noble mind illustrious virtue and honourable carriage had his necessity made use of me i would have put my wealth into donation and the best half should have returnd to him so much i love his heart but i perceive men must learn now with pity to dispense for policy sits above conscience exeunt scene iii a room in sempronius house enter sempronius and a servant of timons must he needs trouble me in thumbove all others he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus and now ventidius is wealthy too whom he redeemd from prison all these owe their estates unto him my lord they have all been touchd and found base metal for they have au denied him how have they denied him has ventidius and lucullus denied him and does he send to me three hum it shows but little love or judgment in him must i be his last refuge his friends like physicians thrive give him over must i take the cure upon me has much disgraced me int im angry at him that might have known my place i see no sense fort but his occasion might have wood me first for in my conscience i was the first man that eer received gift from him and does he think so backwardly of me now that ill requite its last no so it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest and mongst lords i be thought a fool ild rather than the worth of thrice the sum had sent to me first but for my minds sake id such a courage to do him good but now return and with their faint reply this answer join who bates mine honour shall not know my coin exit excellent your lordships a goodly villain the devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself by t and i cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear how fairly this lord strives to appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire of such a nature is his politic love this was my lords best hope now all are fled save only the gods now his friends are dead doors that were neer acquainted with their wards many a bounteous year must be employd now to guard sure their master and this is all a liberal course allows who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house exit scene iv

your lord sends now for money most true he does and he wears jewels now of timons gift for which i wait for money it is against my heart lucilius servantmark how strange it shows timon in this should pay more than he owes and een as if your lord should wear rich jewels and send for money for em im weary of this charge the gods can witness i know my lord hath spent of timons wealth and now

stir me up let me pass quietly believe t my lord and i have made an end i have no more to reckon he to spend lucilius servantay but this answer will not serve if twill not servetis not so base as you

such may rail against great buildings enter servilius o heres servilius now we shall know some answer if i might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour i should derive much fromt for taket of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him hes much out of health and keeps his chamber lucilius servant many do keep their chambers are not sick and if it be so far beyond his health methinks he should the sooner pay his debts and make a clear way to the gods good gods we cannot take this for answer sir within  servilius help my lord my lord enter timon

health and compassion to the senate now captain i am an humble suitor to your virtues for pity is the virtue of the law and none but tyrants use it cruelly it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy upon a friend of mine who in hot blood hath steppd into the law which is past depth to those that without heed do plunge into t he is a man setting his fate aside of comely virtues nor did he soil the fact with cowardice an honour in him which buys out his fault but with a noble fury and fair spirit seeing his reputation touchd to death he did oppose his foe and with such sober and unnoted passion he did behave his anger ere twas spent as if he had but proved an argument you undergo too strict a paradox striving to make an ugly deed look fair your words have took such pains as if they labourd to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling upon the head of valour which indeed is valour misbegot and came into the world when sects and factions were newly born hes truly valiant that can wisely suffer the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs his outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly and neer prefer his injuries to his heart to bring it into danger if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill what folly tis to hazard life for ill my lord you cannot make gross sins look clear to revenge is no valour but to bear my lords then under favour pardon me if i speak like a captain why do fond men expose themselves to battle and not endure all threats sleep upont and let the foes quietly cut their throats without repugnancy if there be such valour in the bearing what make we abroad why then women are more valiant that stay at home if bearing carry it and the ass more captain than the lion the felon loaden with irons wiser than the judge if wisdom be in suffering o my lords as you are great be pitifully good who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood to kill i grant is sins extremest gust but in defence by mercy tis most just to be in anger is impiety but who is man that is not angry weigh but the crime with this you breathe in vain in vain his service done at lacedaemon and byzantium were a sufficient briber for his life whats that i say my lords he has done fair service and slain in fight many of your enemies how full of valour did he bear himself in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds he has made too much plenty with em hes a sworn rioter he has a sin that often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner if there were no foes that were enough to overcome him in that beastly fury he has been known to commit outrages and cherish factions tis inferrd to us his days are foul and his drink dangerous he dies hard fate he might have died in war my lords if not for any parts in him though his right arm might purchase his own time and be in debt to noneyet more to move you take my deserts to his and join em both and for i know your reverend ages love security ill pawn my victories all my honours to you upon his good returns if by this crime he owes the law his life why let the war receive t in valiant gore for law is strict and war is nothing more we are for law he dies urge it no more on height of our displeasure friend or brother he forfeits his own blood that spills another must it be so it must not be my lords i do beseech you know me how call me to your remembrances what i cannot think but your age has forgot me it could not else be i should prove so base to sue and be denied such common grace my wounds ache at you do you dare our anger tis in few words but spacious in effect we banish thee for ever banish me banish your

friends it should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting i should think so he hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and i must needs appear in like manner was i in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse i am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out i am sick of that

this time but my visitation only i will promise him an excellent piece i must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming toward him good as the best promising is the very air o the time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it timon comes from his cave behind aside  excellent workman thou canst not paint a man

sampler sewd her mind but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met and he hath cut those pretty fingers off that could have better sewd than philomel o had the monster seen those lily hands tremble like aspenleaves upon a lute and make the silken strings delight to kiss them he would not then have touchd them for his life or had he heard the heavenly harmony which that sweet tongue hath made he would have droppd his knife and fell asleep as cerberus at the thracian poets feet come let us go and make thy father blind for such a sight will blind a fathers

scene i rome a street enter judges senators and tribunes with martius  and quintus bound passing on to the place of execution titus going before pleading hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in romes great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watchd and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemned sons whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honours lofty bed lieth down the judges  and c pass by him and exeunt for these these tribunes in the dust i write my hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears let my tears stanch the earths dry appetite my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient urns than youthful april shall with all his showers in summers drought ill drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears ill melt the snow and keep eternal springtime on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood enter lucius with his sword drawn o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators o noble father you lament in vain the tribunes hear you not no man is by and you recount your sorrows to a stone ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead grave tribunes once more i entreat of you my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak why tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me or if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attired in grave weeds rome could afford no tribune like to these a stone is soft as waxtribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death rises but wherefore standst thou with thy weapon drawn to rescue my two brothers from their death for which attempt the judges have pronounced my everlasting doom of banishment o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banished but who comes with our brother marcus here enter marcus and lavinia titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep or if not so thy noble heart to break i bring consuming sorrow to thine age will

in thy fathers sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to brightburning troy my grief was at the height before thou camest and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds give me a sword ill chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service are but vain speak gentle sister who hath martyrd thee o that delightful engine of her thoughts that blabbd them with such pleasing eloquence is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage where like a sweet melodious bird it sung sweet varied notes enchanting every ear o say thou for her who hath done this deed o thus i found her straying in the park seeking to hide herself as doth the deer that hath received some unrecuring wound it was my deer and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyrd thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemnd and dead by this look marcus ah son lucius look on her when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew upon a gatherd lily almost witherd perchance she weeps because they killd her husband perchance because she knows them innocent if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath taen revenge on them no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are staind as meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brinepit with our bitter tears or shall we cut away our hands like thine or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days what shall we do let us that have our tongues plot some deuce of further misery to make us wonderd at in time to come sweet father cease your tears for at your grief see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps patience dear niece good titus

men of rome then cheer thy spirit  for know thou emperor i will enchant the old andronicus with words more sweet and yet more dangerous than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep when as the one is wounded with the bait the other rotted with delicious feed but he will not entreat his son for us if tamora entreat him then he will for i can smooth and fill his aged ear with golden promises that

his arms renowned lucius from our troops i strayd to gaze upon a ruinous monastery and as i earnestly did fix mine eye upon the wasted building suddenly i heard a child cry underneath a wall i made unto the noise when soon i heard the crying babe controlld with this discourse peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art had nature lent thee but thy mothers look villain thou mightst have been an emperor but where the bull and cow are both milkwhite they never do beget a coalblack calf peace villain peaceeven thus he rates the babe for i must bear thee to a trusty goth who when he knows thou art the empress babe will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake with this my weapon drawn i rushd upon him surprised him suddenly and brought him hither to use as you think needful of the man o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil that robbd andronicus of his good hand this is the pearl that pleased your empress eye and heres the base fruit of his burning lust say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey this growing image of thy fiendlike face why dost not speak what deaf not a word a halter soldiers hang him on this tree and by his side his

not befall what may befall ill speak no more but vengeance rot you all say on an if it please me which thou speakst thy child shall live and i will see it nourishd an if it please thee why assure thee lucius twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres acts of black night abominable deeds complots of mischief treason villanies ruthful to hear yet piteously performd and this shall all be buried by my death unless thou swear to me my child shall live tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live swear that he shall and then i will begin who should i swear by thou believest no god that granted how canst thou believe an oath what if i do not as indeed i do not yet for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee called conscience with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies which i have seen thee careful to observe therefore i urge thy oath for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears to that ill urge him therefore thou shalt vow by that same god what god soeer it be that thou adorest and hast in reverence to save my boy to nourish and bring him up or else i will discover nought to thee even by my god i swear to thee i will first know thou i begot him on the empress o most insatiate and luxurious woman tut lucius this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon twas her two sons that murderd bassianus they cut thy sisters tongue and ravishd her and cut her hands and trimmd her as thou sawst o detestable villain callst thou that trimming why she was washd and cut and trimmd and twas trim sport for them that had the doing of it o barbarous beastly villains like thyself indeed i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learnd of me as true a dog as ever fought at head well let my deeds be witness of my worth i traind thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within the letter mentiond confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it i playd the cheater for thy fathers hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pryd me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons heads beheld his tears and laughd so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his  and when i told the empress of this sport she swooned almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses what canst thou say all this and never blush ay like a black dog as the saying is art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds ay that i had not done a thousand more even now i curse the dayand yet i think few come within the compass of my curse wherein i did not some notorious ill as kill a man or else devise his death ravish a maid or plot the way to do it accuse some innocent and forswear myself set deadly enmity between two friends make poor mens cattle break their necks set fire on barns and haystacks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears oft have i diggd up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends doors even when their sorrows almost were forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carved in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead tut i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i cannot do ten thousand more bring down the devil for he must not die so sweet a death as hanging presently if there be devils

before and knew him well i say troilus is troilus then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector no nor hector is not troilus in some degrees tis just to each of them he is himself himself alas poor troilus i would he were so he is condition i had gone barefoot to india he is not hector himself no hes not himself would a were himself well the gods are above time must friend or end well

helen herself swore th other day that troilus for a brown favourfor so tis i must confess not brown neither no but brown faith to say truth brown and not brown to say the truth true and not true she praised his complexion above paris why paris hath colour enough so he has then troilus should have too much if she praised him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion i had as lief helens golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris then shes a merry greek indeed nay i am sure she does she came to him th other day into the compassed windowand you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin indeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother hector is he so young a man and so old a lifter but to prove to you that helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin juno have mercy how came it cloven why you know tis dimpled i think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all phrygia o he smiles valiantly does he not o yes an twere a cloud in autumn why go to then but to prove to you that helen loves troilus troilus will stand to the proof if youll prove it so troilus why he esteems her no more than i esteem an addle egg if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i the shell i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin indeed she has a marvellous white hand i must needs confess without the rack and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin alas poor chin many a wart is richer but there was such laughing queen hecuba laughed that her eyes ran oer with millstones and cassandra laughed but there was more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes did her eyes run oer too and hector laughed at what was all this laughing marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus chin ant had been a green hair i should have laughed too they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer what was his answer quoth she heres but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white this is her question thats true make no question of that two and fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is paris my husband the forked one quoth he pluckt out and give it him but there was such laughing and helen so blushed an

knows nought that knows not this men prize the thing ungaind more than it is that she was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue therefore this maxim out of love i teach achievement is command ungaind beseech then though my hearts content firm love doth bear nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear exeunt scene iii the grecian camp before agamemnons tent sennet enter agamemnon nestor ulysses menelaus and others princes what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest reard as knots by the conflux of meeting sap infect the sound pine and divert his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth nor princes is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand sith every action that hath gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bias and thwart not answering the aim and that unbodied figure of the thought that gavet surmised shape why then you princes do you with cheeks abashd behold our works and call them shames which are indeed nought else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men the fineness of which metal is not found in fortunes love for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affined and kin but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus horse wheres then the saucy boat whose weak untimberd sides but even now corivalld greatness either to harbour fled or made a toast for neptune even so doth valours show and valours worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize and with an accent tuned in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune agamemnon thou great commander nerve and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only spirit in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks besides the applause and approbation to which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life i give to both your speeches which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatchd in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axletree on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears to his experienced tongue yet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak speak prince of ithaca and bet of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lips than we are confident when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hectors sword had lackd a master but for these instances the specialty of rule hath been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected degree being vizarded the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask the heavens themselves the planets and this centre observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphered amidst the other whose medicinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil and posts like the commandment of a king sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixure o when degree is shaked which is the ladder to all high designs then enterprise is sick how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogenitive and due of birth prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows each thing meets in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice resides should lose their names and so should justice too then every thing includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb the generals disdaind by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength most wisely hath ulysses here discoverd the fever whereof all our power is sick the nature of the sickness found ulysses what is the remedy the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and awkward action which slanderer he imitation calls he pageants us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks tis like a chime amending with terms unsquared which from the tongue of roaring typhon droppd would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his pressd bed lolling from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause cries excellent tis agamemnon just now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being drest to some oration thats done as near as the extremest ends of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent tis nestor right now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsyfumbling on his gorget shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus or give me ribs of steel i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes and in the imitation of these twain who as ulysses says opinion crowns with an imperial voicemany are infect ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him makes factious feasts rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and sets thersites a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemies weight why this hath not a fingers dignity they call this bedwork mappery closetwar so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swing and rudeness of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution let this be granted and achilles horse makes many thetis sons a tucket what trumpet look menelaus from troy enter aeneas what would you fore our tent is this great agamemnons tent i pray you even this may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly ears with surety stronger than achilles arm fore all the greekish heads which with one voice call agamemnon head and general fair leave and large security how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals how ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus which is that god in office guiding men which is the high and mighty agamemnon this trojan scorns us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers courtiers as free as debonair unarmd as bending angels thats their fame in peace but when they would seem soldiers they have galls good arms strong joints true swords and joves accord nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips the worthiness of praise distains his worth if that the praised himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends that breath fame blows that praise sole sure transcends sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas ay greek that is my name whats your affair i pray you sir pardon tis for agamemnons ears he hears naught privately that comes from troy nor i from troy come not to whisper him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak speak frankly as the wind it is not agamemnons sleeping hour that thou shalt know trojan he is awake he tells thee so himself trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents and every greek of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud trumpet sounds we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince calld hectorpriam is his father who in this dull and longcontinued truce is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords if there be one among the fairst of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valour and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hersto him this challenge hector in view of trojans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did compass in his arms and will tomorrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector shall honour him if none hell say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love if then one is or hath or means to be that one meets hector if none else i am he tell him of nestor one that was a man when hectors grandsire suckd he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this witherd brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood ill prove this truth with my three drops of blood now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth amen fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you sir achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe exeunt all but ulysses and nestor nestor what says ulysses i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape what ist this tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be croppd or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all well and how this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libyathough apollo knows tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment ay with celerity find hectors purpose pointing on him and wake him to the answer think you yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose that can from hector bring his honour off if not achilles thought be a sportful combat yet in the trial much opinion dwells for here the trojans taste our dearst repute with their finest palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly poised in this wild action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large it is supposed he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as twere from us all a man distilld out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence the conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves which entertaind limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs give pardon to my speech therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants show our foulest wares and think perchance theyll sell if not the lustre of the better yet to show shall show the better do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honour and our shame in this are doggd with two strange followers i see them not with my old eyes what are they what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent a nd we were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foild why then we did our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lottery and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off well dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our projects life this shape of sense assumes ajax employd plucks down achilles plumes ulysses now i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste of it forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone exeunt act ii scene i a part of the grecian camp enter ajax and thersites thersites agamemnon how if he had boils full all over generally thersites and those boils did run say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy core dog then would come some matter from him i see none now thou bitchwolfs son canst thou not hear beating him feel then the plague of greece upon thee thou mongrel beefwitted lord speak then thou vinewedst leaven speak i will beat thee into handsomeness i shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but i think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book thou canst strike canst thou a red murrain o thy jades tricks toadstool learn me the proclamation dost

scratching of thee i would make thee the loathsomest scab in greece when thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another i say the proclamation thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at proserpines beauty ay that thou barkest at him mistress thersites thou shouldest strike him cobloaf he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit beating him  you whoreson cur do do thou stool for a witch ay do do thou soddenwitted lord thou hast no more brain than i have in mine elbows an assinego may tutor thee thou scurvyvaliant ass thou art here but to thrash trojans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave if thou use to beat me i will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou you dog you scurvy lord beating him  you cur mars his idiot do rudeness do camel do do enter achilles and patroclus why how now ajax wherefore do you thus how now thersites whats the matter man you see him there do you ay whats the matter nay look upon him so i do whats the matter nay but regard him well well why i do so but yet you look not well upon him for whosoever you take him to be he is ajax i know that fool ay but that fool knows not himself therefore i beat thee lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his evasions have ears thus long i have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones i will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the nineth part of a sparrow this lord achilles ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head ill tell you what i say of him what i say this ajax ajax offers to beat him nay good ajax has not so much wit nay i must hold you as will stop the eye of helens needle for whom he comes to fight peace fool i would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you there o thou damned cur i shall will you set your wit to a fools no i warrant you for a fools will shame it good words thersites whats the quarrel i bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the proclamation and he rails upon me i serve thee not well go to go to i serve here voluntarily your last service was sufferance twas not voluntary no man is beaten voluntary ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impress een so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars hector have a great catch if he knock out either of your brains a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel what with me too thersites theres ulysses and old nestor whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you like draughtoxen and make you plough up the wars what what yes good sooth to achilles to ajax to i shall cut out your tongue tis no matter i shall speak as much as thou afterwards no more words thersites peace i will hold my peace when achilles brach bids me shall i theres for you patroclus i will see you hanged like clotpoles ere i come any more to your tents i will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools exit a good riddance marry this sir is proclaimd through all our host that hector by the fifth hour of the sun will with a trumpet twixt our tents and troy tomorrow morning call some knight to arms that hath a stomach and such a one that dare maintaini know not what tis trash farewell farewell who shall answer him i know not tis put to lottery otherwise he knew his man o meaning you i will go learn more of it exeunt scene ii troy a room in priams palace enter priam hector troilus paris and helenus after so many hours lives speeches spent thus once again says nestor from the greeks deliver helen and all damage else as honour loss of time travail expense wounds friends and what else dear that is consumed in hot digestion of this cormorant war shall be struck off hector what say you tot though no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular yet dread priam there is no lady of more softer bowels more spongy to suck in the sense of fear more ready to cry out who knows what follows than hector is the wound of peace is surety surety secure but modest doubt is calld the beacon of the wise the tent that searches to the bottom of the worst let helen go since the first sword was drawn about this question every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours if we have lost so many tenths of ours to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us had it our name the value of one ten what merits in that reason which denies the yielding of her up fie fie my brother weigh you the worth and honour of a king so great as our dread father in a scale of common ounces will you with counters sum the past proportion of his infinite and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons fie for godly shame no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons you are so empty of them should not our father bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons because your speech hath none that tells him so you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest you fur your gloves with reason here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm you know a sword employd is perilous and reason flies the object of all harm who marvels then when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove or like a star disorbd nay if we talk of reason lets shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour should have harehearts would they but fat their thoughts with this crammd reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject brother she is not worth what she doth cost the holding what is aught but as tis valued but value dwells not in particular will it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein tis precious of itself as in the prizer tis mad idolatry to make the service greater than the god and the will dotes that is attributive to what infectiously itself affects without some image of the affected merit i take today a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores of will and judgment how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elected the wife i chose there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honour we turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soild them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath of full consent bellied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service he touchd the ports desired and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollos and makes stale the morning why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping why she is a pearl whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships and turnd crownd kings to merchants if youll avouch twas wisdom paris went as you must needs for you all cried go go if youll confess he brought home noble prize as you must needs for you all clappd your hands and cried inestimablewhy do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate and do a deed that fortune never did beggar the estimation which you prized richer than sea and land o theft most base that we have stoln what we do fear to keep but thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln that in their country did them that disgrace we fear to warrant in our native place within  cry trojans cry what noise what shriek is this tis our mad sister i do know her voice within  cry trojans it is cassandra enter cassandra raving cry trojans cry lend me ten thousand eyes and i will fill them with prophetic tears peace sister peace virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld soft infancy that nothing canst but cry add to my clamours let us pay betimes a moiety of that mass of moan to come cry trojans cry practise your eyes with tears troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand our firebrand brother paris burns us all cry trojans cry a helen and a woe cry cry troy burns or else let helen go exit now youthful troilus do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandras mad her brainsick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engaged to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touchd than all priams sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain else might the world convince of levity as well my undertakings as your counsels but i attest the gods your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut off all fears attending on so dire a project for what alas can these my single arms what propugnation is in one mans valour to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite yet i protest were i alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as i have will paris should neer retract what he hath done nor faint in the pursuit paris you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights you have the honey still but these the gall so to be valiant is no praise at all sir i propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it but i would have the soil of her fair rape wiped off in honourable keeping her what treason were it to the ransackd queen disgrace to your great worths and shame to me now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms theres not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended nor none so noble whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamed where helen is the subject then i say well may we fight for her whom we know well the worlds large spaces cannot parallel paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have glozed but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemperd blood than to make up a free determination twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision nature craves all dues be renderd to their owners now what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband if this law of nature be corrupted through affection and that great minds of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills resist the same there is a law in each wellorderd nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to spartas king as it is known she is these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back returnd thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong but makes it much more heavy hectors opinion is this in way of truth yet neertheless my spritely brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for tis a cause that hath no mean dependance upon our joint and several dignities why there you touchd the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide worlds revenue i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamus i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dun and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits i was advertised their great general slept whilst emulation in the army crept this i presume will wake him exeunt scene iii the grecian camp before achilles tent enter thersites solus how now thersites what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he beats me and i rail at him o worthy satisfaction would it were otherwise that i could beat him whilst he railed at me sfoot ill learn to conjure and raise devils but ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations then theres achilles a rare enginer if troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves o thou great thunderdarter of olympus forget that thou art jove the king of gods and mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which shortarmed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web after this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the boneache for that methinks is the curse dependent on those that war for a placket i have said my prayers and devil envy say amen what ho my lord achilles enter patroclus whos there thersites good thersites come in and rail if i could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself the common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee let thy blood be thy direction till thy death then if she that lays thee out says thou

achilles thy lord thersites then tell me i pray thee whats thyself thy knower patroclus then tell me patroclus what art thou thou mayst tell that knowest o tell tell ill decline the whole question agamemnon commands achilles achilles is my lord i am patroclus knower and patroclus is a fool you rascal peace fool i have not done he is a privileged man proceed thersites agamemnon is a fool achilles is a fool thersites is a fool and as aforesaid patroclus is a fool derive this come agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and patroclus is a fool positive why am i a fool make that demand of the prover it suffices me thou art look you who comes here patroclus ill speak with nobody come in with me thersites exit here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery all the argument is a cuckold and a whore a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all exit enter agamemnon ulysses nestor diomedes and ajax where is achilles within his tent but ill disposed my lord let it be known to him that we are here he shent our messengers and we lay by our appertainments visiting of him let him be told so lest perchance he think we dare not move the question of our place or know not what we are i shall say so to him exit we saw him at the opening of his tent he is not sick yes lionsick sick of proud heart you may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head tis pride but why why let him show us the cause a word my lord takes agamemnon aside what moves ajax thus to bay at him achilles hath inveigled his fool from him who thersites he then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument no you see he is his argument that has his argument achilles all the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie here comes patroclus reenter patroclus no achilles with him the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure achilles bids me say he is much sorry if any thing more than your sport and pleasure did move your greatness and this noble state to call upon him he hopes it is no other but for your health and your digestion sake and afterdinners breath hear you patroclus we are too well acquainted with these answers but his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn cannot outfly our apprehensions much attribute he hath and much the reason why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues not virtuously on his own part beheld do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish are like to rot untasted go and tell him we come to speak with him and you shall not sin if you do say we think him overproud and underhonest in selfassumption greater than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on disguise the holy strength of their command and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance yea watch his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if the passage and whole carriage of this action rode on his tide go tell him this and add that if he overhold his price so much well none of him but let him like an engine not portable lie under this report bring action hither this cannot go to war a stirring dwarf we do allowance give before a sleeping giant tell him so i shall and bring his answer presently exit in second voice well not be satisfied we come to speak with him ulysses enter you exit ulysses what is he more than another no more than what he thinks he is is he so much do you not think he thinks himself a better man than i am no question will you subscribe his thought and say he is no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable why should a man be proud how doth pride grow i know not what pride is your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise i do hate a proud man as i hate the engendering of toads yet he loves himself ist not strange aside reenter ulysses achilles will not to the field tomorrow whats his excuse he doth rely on none but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any in will peculiar and in selfadmission why will he not upon our fair request untent his person and share the air with us things small as nothing for requests sake only he makes important possessd he is with greatness and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at selfbreath imagined worth holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse that twixt his mental and his active parts kingdomd achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself what should i say he is so plaguy proud that the deathtokens of it cry no recovery let ajax go to him dear lord go you and greet him in his tent tis said he holds you well and will be led at your request a little from himself o agamemnon let it not be so well consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts save such as do revolve and ruminate himself shall he be worshippd of that we hold an idol more than he no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord must not so stale his palm nobly acquired nor by my will assubjugate his merit as amply titled as achilles is by going to achilles that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion this lord go to him jupiter forbid and say in thunder achilles go to him aside to diomedes  o this is well he rubs the vein of him aside to nestor  and how his silence drinks up this applause if i go to him with my armed fist ill pash him oer the face o no you shall not go an a be proud with me ill pheeze his pride let me go to him not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel a paltry insolent fellow how he describes himself can he not be sociable the raven chides blackness ill let his humours blood he will be the physician that should be the patient an all men were o my mind wit would be out of fashion a should not bear it so a should eat swords first shall pride carry it an twould yould carry half a would have ten shares i will knead him ill make him supple hes not yet through warm force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dry to agamemnon  my lord you feed too much on this dislike our noble general do not do so you must prepare to fight without achilles why tis this naming of him does him harm here is a manbut tis before his face i will be silent wherefore should you so he is not emulous as achilles is know the whole world he is as valiant a whoreson dog that shall pelter thus with us would he were a trojan what a vice were it in ajax now if he were proud or covetous of praise ay or surly borne or strange or selfaffected thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature thrice famed beyond all erudition but he

than water if my fears have eyes fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to fear the worst oft cures the worse o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupids pageant there is presented no monster nor nothing monstrous neither nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit they say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one they that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters are there such such are not we praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his

they are constant being won they are burs i can tell you theyll stick where they are thrown boldness comes to me now and brings me heart prince troilus i have loved you night and day for many weary months why was my cressid then so hard to win hard to seem won but i was won my lord with the first glance that everpardon me if i confess much you will play the tyrant i love you now but not till now so much but i might master it in faith i lie my thoughts were like unbridled children grown too headstrong for their mother see we fools why have i blabbd who shall be true to us when we are so unsecret to ourselves but though i loved you well i wood you not and yet good faith i wishd myself a man or that we women had mens privilege of speaking first sweet bid me hold my tongue for in this rapture i shall surely speak the thing i shall repent see see your silence cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws my very soul of counsel stop my mouth and shall albeit sweet music issues thence pretty i faith my lord i do beseech you pardon me twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss i am ashamed o heavens what have i done for this time will i take my leave my lord your leave sweet cressid leave an you take leave till tomorrow morning pray you content you what offends you lady sir mine own company you cannot shun yourself let me go and try i have a kind of self resides with you but an unkind self that itself will leave to be anothers fool i would be gone where is my wit i know not what i speak well know they what they speak that speak so wisely perchance my lord i show more craft than love and fell so roundly to a large confession to angle for your thoughts but you are wise or else you love not for to be wise and love exceeds mans might that dwells with gods above o that i thought it could be in a woman as if it can i will presume in you to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beautys outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowd purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truths simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth in that ill war with you o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare want similes truth tired with iteration as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to the centre yet after all comparisons of truth as truths authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers prophet may you be if i be false or swerve a hair from truth when time is old and hath forgot itself when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy and blind oblivion swallowd cities up and mighty states characterless are grated to dusty nothing yet let memory from false to false among false maids in love upbraid my falsehood when theyve said as false as air as water wind or sandy earth as fox to lamb as wolf to heifers calf pard to the hind or stepdame to her son yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood as false as cressid go to a bargain made seal it seal it ill be the witness here i hold your hand here my cousins if ever you prove false one to another since i have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goersbetween be called to

the grecian camp before achilles tent enter agamemnon ulysses diomedes nestor ajax menelaus and calchas now princes for the service i have done you the advantage of the time prompts me aloud to call for recompense appear it to your mind that through the sight i bear in things to love i have abandond troy left my possession incurrd a traitors name exposed myself from certain and possessd conveniences to doubtful fortunes sequestering from me all that time acquaintance custom and condition made tame and most familiar to my nature and here to do you service am become as new into the world strange unacquainted i do beseech you as in way of taste to give me now a little benefit out of those many registerd in promise which you say live to come in my behalf what wouldst thou of us trojan make demand you have a trojan prisoner calld antenor yesterday took troy holds him very dear oft have youoften have you thanks therefore desired my cressid in right great exchange whom troy hath still denied but this antenor i know is such a wrest in their affairs that their negotiations all must slack wanting his manage and they will almost give us a prince of blood a son of priam in change of him let him be sent great princes and he shall buy my daughter and her presence shall quite strike off all service i have done in most accepted pain let diomedes bear him and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have what he requests of us good diomed furnish you fairly for this interchange withal bring word if hector will tomorrow be answerd in his challenge ajax is ready this shall i undertake and tis a burden which i am proud to bear exeunt diomedes and calchas enter achilles and patroclus before their tent achilles stands i the entrance of his tent please it our general to pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last tis like hell question me why such unplausive eyes are bent on him if so i have derision medicinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may be good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud mans fees well execute your purpose and put on a form of strangeness as we pass along so do each lord and either greet him not or else disdainfully which shall shake him more than if not lookd on i will lead the way what comes the general to speak with me you know my mind ill fight no more gainst troy what says achilles would he aught with us would you my lord aught with the general no nothing my lord the better exeunt agamemnon and nestor good day good day how do you how do you exit what does the cuckold scorn me how now patroclus good morrow ajax ha good morrow ay and good next day too exit what mean these fellows know they not achilles they pass by strangely they were used to bend to send their smiles before them to achilles to come as humbly as they used to creep to holy altars what am i poor of late tis certain greatness once falln out with fortune must fall out with men too what the declined is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honour but honour for those honours that are without him as place riches favour prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery standers the love that leand on them as slippery too do one pluck down another and together die in the fall but tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these mens looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given here is ulysses ill interrupt his reading how now ulysses now great thetis son what are you reading a strange fellow here writes me that man how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver this is not strange ulysses the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not but commends itself to others eyes nor doth the eye itself that most pure spirit of sense behold itself not going from itself but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each others form for speculation turns not to itself till it hath travelld and is mirrord there where it may see itself this is not strange at all i do not strain at the position it is familiarbut at the authors drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of any thing though in and of him there be much consisting till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formd in the applause where theyre extended who like an arch reverberates the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat  i was much wrapt in this and apprehended here immediately the unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow an act that very chance doth throw upon him ajax renownd o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortunes hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into anothers pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lordswhy even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hectors breast and great troy shrieking i do believe it for they passd by me as misers do by beggars neither gave to me good word nor look what are my deeds forgot time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a greatsized monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devourd as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honour bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mockery take the instant way for honour travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or hedge aside from the direct forthright like to an enterd tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse falln in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear oerrun and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must oertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand and with his arms outstretchd as he would fly grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing o let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigour of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise newborn gawds though they are made and moulded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt oerdusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what not stirs the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction of this my privacy i have strong reasons but gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priams daughters ha known is that a wonder the providence thats in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus gold finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps keeps place with thought and almost like the gods does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mysterywith whom relation durst never meddlein the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our islands sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hectors sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides oer the ice that you should break exit to this effect achilles have i moved you a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loathed than an effeminate man in time of action i stand condemnd for this they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold and like a dewdrop from the lions mane be shook to air shall ajax fight with hector ay and perhaps receive much honour by him i see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewdly gored o then beware those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger and danger like an ague subtly taints even then when we sit idly in the sun go call thersites hither sweet patroclus ill send the fool to ajax and desire him to invite the trojan lords after the combat to see us here unarmd i have a womans longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in his weeds of peace to talk with him and to behold his visage even to my full of view enter thersites a labour saved a wonder what ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself how so he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing how can that be why he stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as

more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me have the gods envy ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case and is it true that i must go from troy a hateful truth what and from troilus too from troy and troilus is it possible and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leavetaking justles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own labouring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell

full of quality theyre loving well composed with gifts of nature flowing and swelling oer with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy which i beseech you call a virtuous sin makes me afeard o heavens you love me not die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted do you think i will no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers

hector armed aeneas troilus and other trojans with attendants hail all you state of greece what shall be done to him that victory commands or do you purpose a victor shall be known will you the knights shall to the edge of all extremity pursue each other or shall be divided by any voice or order of the field hector bade ask which way would hector have it he cares not hell obey conditions tis done like hector but securely done a little proudly and great deal misprizing the knight opposed if not achilles sir what is your name if not achilles nothing therefore achilles but whateer know this in the extremity of great and little valour and pride excel themselves in hector the one almost as infinite as all the other blank as nothing weigh him well and that which looks like pride is courtesy this ajax is half made of hectors blood in love whereof half hector stays at home half heart half hand half hector comes to seek this blended knight half trojan and half greek a maiden battle then o i perceive you reenter diomedes here is sir diomed go gentle knight stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas consent upon the order of their fight so be it either to the uttermost or else a breath the combatants being kin half stints their strife before their strokes begin ajax and hector enter the lists they are opposed already what trojan is that same that looks so heavy the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmd his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty nor dignifies an impure thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilion thus translate him to me alarum hector and ajax fight they are in action now ajax hold thine own hector thou sleepst awake thee his blows are well disposed there ajax you must no more trumpets cease princes enough so please you i am not warm yet let us fight again as hector pleases why then will i no more thou art great lord my fathers sisters son a cousingerman to great priams seed the obligation of our blood forbids a gory emulation twixt us twain were thy commixtion greek and trojan so that thou couldst say this hand is grecian all and this is trojan the sinews of this leg all greek and this all troy my mothers blood runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister bounds in my fathers by jove multipotent thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member wherein my sword had not impressure made of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay that any drop thou borrowdst from thy mother my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword be draind let me embrace thee ajax by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms hector would have them fall upon him thus cousin all honour to thee i thank thee hector thou art too gentle and too free a man i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence a great addition earned in thy death not neoptolemus so mirable on whose bright crest fame with her loudst oyes cries this is he could promise to himself a thought of added honour torn from hector there is expectance here from both the sides what further you will do well answer it the issue is embracement ajax farewell if i might in entreaties find success as seld i have the chancei would desire my famous cousin to our grecian tents tis agamemnons wish and great achilles doth long to see unarmd the valiant hector aeneas call my brother troilus to me and signify this loving interview to the expecters of our trojan part desire them home give me thy hand my cousin i will go eat with thee and see your knights great agamemnon

young leander crossd the hellespont thats a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swum the hellespont over the boots nay give me not the boots no i will not for it boots thee not what to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moments mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labour won however but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquished so by your circumstance you call me fool so by your circumstance i fear youll prove tis love you cavil at i am not love love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender wit is turnd to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee that art a votary to fond desire once more adieu my father at the road expects my coming there to see me shippd and thither will i bring thee valentine sweet proteus no now let us take our leave to milan

master is a shepherd then and i a sheep i do why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep a silly answer and fitting well a sheep this proves me still a sheep true and thy master a shepherd nay that i can deny by a circumstance it shall go hard but ill prove it by another the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep such another proof will make me cry baa but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to julia ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a lost mutton

worthiest love please you repeat their names ill show my mind according to my shallow simple skill what thinkst thou of the fair sir eglamour as of a knight wellspoken neat and fine but were i you he never should be mine what thinkst thou of the rich mercatio well of his wealth but of himself so so what thinkst thou of the gentle proteus lord lord to see what folly reigns in us how now what means this passion at his name pardon dear madam tis a passing shame that i unworthy body as i am should censure thus on lovely gentlemen why not on proteus as of all the rest then thus of many good i think him best your reason i have no other but a womans reason i think him so because i think him so and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him ay if you thought your love not cast away why he of all the rest hath never moved me yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye his little speaking shows his love but small fire thats closest kept burns most of all they do not love that do not show their love o they love least that let men know their love i would i knew his mind peruse this paper madam to julia say from whom that the contents will show say say who gave it thee valentines page and sent i think from proteus he would have given it you but i being in the way did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray now by my modesty a goodly broker dare you presume to harbour wanton lines to whisper and conspire against my youth now trust me tis an office of great worth and you an officer fit for the place or else return no more into my sight to plead for love deserves more fee than hate will ye be gone that you may ruminate exit and yet i would i had oerlooked the letter it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her what a fool is she that knows i am a maid and would not force the letter to my view since maids in modesty say no to that which they would have the profferer construe ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when willingly i would have had her here how angerly i taught my brow to frown when inward joy

fortune there some to discover islands far away some to the studious universities for any or for all these exercises he said that proteus your son was meet and did request me to importune you to let him spend his time no more at home which would be great impeachment to his age in having known no travel in his youth nor needst thou much importune me to that whereon this month i have been hammering

mine own hearts sorrow o gentle proteus loves a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be

perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love that i did love for now my love is thawd which like a waxen image gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and thats the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reasons light but when i look on her perfections there is

friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stoln away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my dutys sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave proteus i thank thee for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judged me fast asleep and oftentimes have purposed to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man a rashness that i ever yet have shunnd i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tower the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she cannot be conveyd away know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamberwindow will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimed at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretence upon mine honour he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this adieu my lord sir

must be secret tis not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honourable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter cannot your grace win her to fancy him no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherishd by her childlike duty i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her weddingdower for me and my possessions she esteems not what would your grace have me to do in this there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my aged eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is changed how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sunbright eye win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a womans mind but she did scorn a present that i sent her a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her send her another never give her oer for scorn at first makes afterlove the more if she do frown tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide tis not to have you gone for why the fools are mad if left alone take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though neer so black say they have angels faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from

special virtue for then she need not be washed and scoured item she can spin then may i set the world on wheels when she can spin for her living item she hath many nameless virtues thats as much as to say bastard virtues that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names here follow her vices close at the heels of her virtues item she is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breath well that fault may be mended with a breakfast read on item she hath a sweet mouth that makes amends for her sour breath item she doth talk in her sleep its no matter for that so she sleep not in her

ill after to rejoice in the boys correction exit scene ii the same the dukes palace enter duke and thurio sir thurio fear not but that she will love you now valentine is banishd from her sight since his exile she hath despised me most forsworn my company and raild at me that i am desperate of obtaining her this weak impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice which with an hours heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot enter proteus how now sir proteus is your countryman according to our proclamation gone gone my good lord my daughter takes his going grievously a little time my lord will kill that grief so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace thou knowst how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter i do my lord and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will she did my lord when valentine was here ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay but shell think that it is spoke in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend then you must undertake to slander him and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend you have prevaild my lord if i can do it by ought that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio therefore as you unwind her love from him lest it should ravel and be good to none you must provide to bottom it on me which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentines report you are already loves firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friends sake will be glad of you where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend as much as i can do i will effect but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be fullfraught with serviceable vows ay much is the force of heavenbred poesy say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands after your direlamenting elegies visit by night your ladys chamberwindow with some sweet

auburn mine is perfect yellow if that be all the difference in his love ill get me such a colourd periwig her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine ay but her foreheads low and mines as high what should it be that he respects in her but i can make respective in myself if this fond love were not a blinded god come shadow come and take this shadow up for tis thy rival o thou senseless form thou shalt be worshippd kissd loved and adored and were there sense in his idolatry my substance should be statue in thy stead ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake that used me so or else by jove i

ladies eyes for i had rather wink than look on them how likes she my discourse ill when you talk of war but well when i discourse of love and peace aside  but better indeed when you hold your peace what says she to my valour o sir she makes no doubt of that aside  she needs not when she knows it cowardice what says she to my birth that you are well derived aside  true from a gentleman to a fool

penance wanderd through the forest him he knew well and guessd that it was she but being maskd he was not sure of it besides she did intend confession at patricks cell this even and there she was not

ceremonious solemn and unearthly it was i the offering but of all the burst and the eardeafening voice o the oracle kin to joves thunder so surprised my sense that i was nothing if the event o the journey prove as successful to the queeno bet so as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy the time is worth the use ont great apollo turn all to the best these proclamations so forcing faults upon hermione i little like the violent carriage of it will clear or end the business when the oracle thus by apollos great divine seald up shall the contents discover something rare even then will rush to knowledge go fresh horses and gracious be the issue exeunt scene ii a court of justice enter leontes lords and officers this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved let us be cleard of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation produce the prisoner it is his highness pleasure that the queen appear in person here in court silence enter hermione guarded paulina and ladies attending read the indictment reads            hermione queen to the worthy leontes king of sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in committing adultery with polixenes king of bohemia and conspiring with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open thou hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for their better safety to fly away by night since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me to say not guilty mine integrity being counted falsehood shall as i express it be so received but thus if powers divine behold our human actions as they do i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience you my lord best know who least will seem to do so my past life hath been as continent as chaste as true as i am now unhappy which is more than history can pattern though devised and playd to take spectators for behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe a moiety of the throne a great kings daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honour fore who please to come and hear for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour tis a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for i appeal to your own conscience sir before polixenes came to your court how i was in your grace how merited to be so since he came with what encounter so uncurrent i have straind to appear thus if one jot beyond the bound of honour or in act or will that way inclining hardend be the hearts of all that hear me and my nearst of kin cry fie upon my grave i neer heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first thats true enough through tis a saying sir not due to me you will not own it more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault i must not at all acknowledge for polixenes with whom i am accused i do confess i loved him as in honour he required with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke even since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dishd for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant you knew of his departure as you know what you have undertaen to do ins absence sir you speak a language that i understand not my life stands in the level of your dreams which ill lay down your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dreamd it as you were past all shame those of your fact are soso past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning itwhich is indeed more criminal in thee than itso thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death sir spare your threats the bug which you would fright me with i seek to me can life be no commodity the crown and comfort of my life your favour i do give lost for i do feel it gone but know not how it went my second joy and firstfruits of my body from his presence i am barrd like one infectious my third comfort starrd most unluckily is from my breast the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth haled out to murder myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred the childbed privilege denied which longs to women of all fashion lastly hurried here to this place i the open air before i have got strength of limit now my liege tell me what blessings i have here alive that i should fear to die therefore proceed but yet hear this mistake me not no life i prize it not a straw but for mine honour which i would free if i shall be condemnd upon surmises all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake i tell you tis rigor and not law your honours all i do refer me to the oracle apollo be my judge this your request is altogether just therefore bring forth and in apollos name his oracle exeunt certain officers the emperor of russia was my father o that he were alive and here beholding his daughters trial that he did but see the flatness of my misery yet with eyes of pity not

formerly he hath appeared i have considered so much camillo and with some care so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom i have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate i have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage thats likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons

the gods do this year connive at us and we may do any thing extempore the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not dot i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession reenter clown and shepherd aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lanes end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work see see what a man you are now there is no other way but to tell the king shes a changeling and none of your flesh and blood nay but hear me nay but hear me go to then she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her this being done let the law go whistle i warrant you i will tell the king all every word yea and his sons pranks too who i may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the kings brotherinlaw indeed brotherinlaw was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by i know how much an ounce aside  very wisely puppies well let us to the king there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard aside  i know not what

this hour if i may come to the speech of him age thou hast lost thy labour why sir the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief so tis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherds daughter if that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster think you so sir not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary an old sheepwhistling rogue a ramtender to offer to have his daughter

exeunt shepherd and clown if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth i am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement i will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs tot to him will i present them there may be matter in it exit act v scene i a room in leontes palace enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and servants sir you have done enough and have performd a saintlike sorrow no fault could you make which you have not redeemd indeed paid down more penitence than done trespass at the last do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man bred his hopes out of true too

the time more benefit and graced your kindness better you are one of those would have him wed again if you would not so you pity not the state nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name consider little what dangers by his highness fail of issue may drop upon his kingdom and devour incertain lookers on what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well what holier than for royaltys repair for present comfort and for future good to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow tot there is none worthy respecting her thats gone besides the gods will have fulfilld their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said ist not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills to leontes care not for issue the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to the worthiest so his successor was like to be the best good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honour

all greetings that a king at friend can send his brother and but infirmity which waits upon worn times hath something seized his wishd ability he had himself the lands and waters twixt your throne and

and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behindhand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to the earth and hath he too exposed this paragon to the fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less the adventure of her person good my lord she came from libya where the warlike smalus that noble honourd lord is feard and loved most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter his tears proclaimd his parting with her thence a prosperous southwind friendly we have crossd to execute the charge my father gave me for visiting your highness my best train i have from your sicilian shores dismissd who for bohemia bend to signify not only my success in libya sir but my arrival and my wifes in safety here where we are

things as you enter a lord most noble sir that which i shall report will bear no credit were not the proof so nigh please you great sir bohemia greets you from himself by me desires you to attach his son who has his dignity and duty both cast off fled from his father from his hopes and with a shepherds daughter wheres bohemia speak here in your city i now came from him i speak amazedly and it becomes my marvel and my message to your court whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems of this fair couple meets he on the way the father of this seeming lady and her brother having both their country quitted with this young prince camillo has betrayd me whose honour and whose honesty till now endured all weathers layt so to his charge hes with the king your father who camillo camillo sir i spake with him who now has these poor men in question never saw i wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth forswear themselves as often as they speak bohemia stops his ears and threatens them with divers deaths in death o my poor father the heaven sets spies upon us will not have our contract celebrated you are married we are not sir nor are we like to be the stars i see will kiss the valleys first the odds for high and lows alike my lord is this the daughter of a king she is when once she is my wife that once i see by your good fathers speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her dear look up though fortune visible an enemy should chase us with my father power no jot hath she to change our loves beseech you sir remember since you owed no more to time than i do now with thought of such affections step forth mine advocate at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles would he do so ild beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle sir my liege your eye hath too much youth int not a month fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now i thought of her even in these looks i made to florizel but your petition is yet unanswerd i will to your father your honour not oerthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord exeunt scene ii before leontes palace enter autolycus and a gentleman beseech you sir were you present at this relation i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child i would most gladly know the issue of it i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be enter another gentleman here comes a gentleman that haply knows more the news rogero nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it enter a third gentleman here comes the lady paulinas steward he can deliver you more how goes it now sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear youll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle of queen hermiones her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter did you see the meeting of the two kings no then have you lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it what pray you became of antigonus that carried hence the child like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherds son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows what became of his bark and his followers wrecked the same instant of their masters death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found but o the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the manner how she came tot bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an alas i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world could have seen t the woe had been universal are they returned to the court no the princess hearing of her mothers statue which is in the keeping of paulinaa piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master julio romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge lets along exeunt gentlemen now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits enter shepherd and clown here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born you are well met sir you denied to fight with me this other day because i was no gentleman born see

tears that ever we shed we may live son to shed many more ay or else twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen thou wilt amend thy life ay an it like your good worship give me thy hand

be false son if it be neer so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend and ill swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but ill swear it and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands i will prove so sir to my power ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the queens picture come follow us well be thy good masters exeunt scene iii a chapel in paulinas house enter leontes polixenes florizel perdita camillo paulina lords and attendants o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of

house to visit it is a surplus of your grace which never my life may last to answer o paulina we honour you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we passd through

posture chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so aged as this seems o not by much so much the more our carvers excellence which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i wood her i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it o royal piece theres magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee and give me
